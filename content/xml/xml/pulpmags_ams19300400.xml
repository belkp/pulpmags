O'Conor Sloane, Ph. D.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE great watershed, which supplies the lake region of</seg><seg type="columnLine">America, beginning with Lake Ontario and extending</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the west end of Lake Superior, represents, if we take</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in one unit, one of the biggest in land or seas of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world. All the water from this great watershed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which reaches the eastern end of Lake Erie, falls in one mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">cataract over Niagara Falls. There is an enormous evaporation</seg><seg type="columnLine">from these lakes, but a very large fraction of the water which</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls into them goes in one concentrated mass--or let us say, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated masses--over the precipice of Niagara, the Canadian</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls and the American Falls, separated by Goat Island. To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer it represents nothing more nor less than a wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of water power. To him its scenic value means nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He is apt to forget that this very scenic value has brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of dollars from visitors to the region in the past century</seg><seg type="columnLine">--for tourists and the proverbial wedding couples have visited</seg><seg type="columnLine">Niagara in enormous numbers. But the engineer would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">away all the water, would run it through tunnels, drive turbines</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it and use it for the production of power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many years ago it was considered a crime to charge interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">for money. It was called usury. The idea, of course, was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">money did not suffer in use. If you loaned a man 100 shillings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instance, when it was returned, you got 100 shillings back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">none the worse for wear. But now money has a definite value</seg><seg type="columnLine">for its use. Money now makes money, and the money which</seg><seg type="columnLine">does your earning is given the name of capital. And this capital</seg><seg type="columnLine">plays a very curious part in evaluating natural sources of power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, or water; yet it may be made the servant of man. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">production of the same amount of power, a hydro plant may cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal more than a steam plant would cost for the devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opment of the same quantity of power units. The water-power</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant, it may be said, uses up nothing, because the water is sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied from natural sources. It is drawn up by the heat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, precipitated in regions distant from the water-power station,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pours down over the watersheds, through all the streams and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivers, and reaches at last the desired place and there develops</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, we may say, for nothing--at least, for nothing as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the consumption of the water is concerned. But there is a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy cost in interest on the capital that would have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">invested in the plant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In very many places--perhaps in the majority of cases--a steam</seg><seg type="columnLine">jilant, although it uses up coal and demands constant labor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">care for the machinery to do the firing under the boilers--all</seg><seg type="columnLine">more pro rata than is required in a hydro plant--yet it saves on</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiie interest of the money invested, because this money is much</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than the cost of the corresponding water plant. This is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">universal, but it occurs frequently enough to make it a recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that steam power driven by coal, mined and dragged up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bowels of the earth, fired by hand or by automatic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stokers, is really cheaper than where nature hands us over all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power we want in the shape of flowing water, such as we see at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Niagara Falls, or in nearly as impressive a way in the rapids of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the St. Lawrence River.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In other words, that mighty watershed could give us any</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of power stations; but the power stations would prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably cost so much that steam power would be cheaper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Going down the St. Lawrence River from Niagara Falls to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quebec the Great Rapids which drive down through the wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">channel with such resistless force, offer an opportunity for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of power stations. Thus in a sense the water from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Lakes can be used over and over again. If we go to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of Lake Michigan at Chicago there we find some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water diverted from its proper course and discharged into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head waters of the Mississippi River, running down to the Gulf</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mexico instead of taking its proper course to the Gulf of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. Lawrence. Here, too, a hydraulic power station could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed which would give a practicable amount of power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We are constantly hearing of different chances for the estab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lishment of power plants driven by water, and all sorts of claims</seg><seg type="columnLine">are made that these should not be monopolized by private com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panies ; that they should be for the service of the people and be</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinder government ownership. Government ownership generally</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns out to be a very expensive luxury. But that, of course, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a side issue. The fact remains that proper steam plants in many</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases are cheaper to run than are hydro plants, because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminished capital required in many cases. Often to secure water</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, an enormously expensive dam must be built and that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the beginning of things, because the power plant itself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbines and electric generators in its interest on the capital costs</seg><seg type="columnLine">far more than the coal which would be consumed by a steam</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant of equal power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Natural sources of power of enormous amount in the aggre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate are being discarded, or what is not quite as bad. are not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing utilized. The power of the wind which brought Columbus to</seg><seg type="columnLine">America is now being used less and less. Steamships and motor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven vessels are sent across the ocean and no consideration is</seg><seg type="columnLine">applied to the wind, and while there may be a gale blowing behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, which certainly would add to their speed, it is not thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth while to provide the plant in the shape of masts and sails</seg><seg type="columnLine">to utilize this power. Windmills which at one time were, rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively speaking, quite numerous in Holland and in England, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which there are many in America, they too have been put</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the discard to a great extent. But wind and water are only</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of the natural powers which man has found it apparently ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedient to neglect. Natural powers are waiting for us all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth, but presumably will hardly ever be used to any extent</seg><seg type="columnLine">as long as coal and oil are as abundant as they are today.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Metal Horde</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By John W.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem fated to be with that man every time some great</seg><seg type="columnLine">event breaks on the System. I was with him when Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Downey announced his discovery of the secret of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">age--or, better, its prevention.

There was a limit to what he could stand, though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it took him many thousands of miles to bring the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine down to a speed compatible with atmospheric con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions of the planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tlie air of the planet seemed thick with traffic, mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-million ton lift freighters and passenger ships set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting out toward Earth, smaller private machines, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">none were slower nor faster than the others, for all were</seg><seg type="columnLine">limited only by the acceleration they could stand. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only one speed limit, that of economical, safe oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation, for with all space to move in, there was no need</seg><seg type="columnLine">of speed laws. Yet it seemed impossible to make any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than two thousand miles an hour through this slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving air traffic--then there shone a little emblem on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bow of the little iridescent metal ship, and a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">freighter swerved respectfully aside.

And none but conceded the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Presidency gladly to the greatest of them, Steven</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waterson of Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Gentlemen of the Cabinet, I am beginning to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is time we had something added to the Constitution</seg><seg type="columnLine">forbidding Members of the Cabinet to rise on the entry</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the President." Waterson deeply appreciated that</seg><seg type="columnLine">compliment, as they all knew, but he could not feel at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">home in an atmosphere of diffidence. He was a scientist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a planner, not a diplomat. "I am sorry I was forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make you gentlemen wait for me, but as you see," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, pointing to the great map of the System on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ceiling of the Cabinet chamber, where the slow mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the planets in their orbits was being accurately</seg><seg type="columnLine">traced, "Earth is in superior conjunction at present, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not make better time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see from this memorandum that has been prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me that Mansol Korac, Martian Astro-physicist, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be our first speaker. I take it you have had no offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial discussion as yet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was correct in this assumption for the men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">convened shortly before at his radio announcement that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would land within an hour,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some years before there had been some agitation to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the Cabinet meetings carried on by Radio-vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates, but the low speed of light had made the speeches</seg><seg type="columnLine">a terrible failure, as they would frequently have to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten or even fifteen minutes while the radio messages</seg><seg type="columnLine">were reaching them. Over short distances that method</seg><seg type="columnLine">was practicable, but between planets light is too slow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it cannot be used.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some time ago our radio engineers developed a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument for detecting exceptionally short waves. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">really came under the category of the longer heat radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ations, but were detected electrically. While experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menting with this device they have been consistently</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking' up signals apparently originating in free space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first these signals were exceedingly weak, but their</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensity has grown uniformly and rapidly, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the results some amazing conclusions have been drawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are originating at some source or sources out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in space in the direction of the sun Sirius. I was asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help the radiation engineers under Horus Mai in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculation of the Astro-physical aspect of the problem.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I believe that there are some man-made vehicles out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in space sending those signals. No man of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">System has ever had reason to venture beyond the orbit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Neptune for any great distance; there would be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for it, as none of the outer planets are habitable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rate of increase of the signal strength, coupled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">observations made from Earth, Mars and Venus, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it evident that they are at present about one and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quarter billion miles away, but approaching us at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of 1000 miles a second. This means that in ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximately two weeks they will reach our planets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"AS to their point of origin we can only make guesses</seg><seg type="columnLine">-tY really. They are coming toward us with Sirius--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thousands of other stars--at their back. Of all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sirius is the nearest, being approximately nine light</seg><seg type="columnLine">years away. This means that they must have spent at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least 1600 years on that trip across space. Dr. James</seg><seg type="columnLine">Downey of Earth has recently shown us how to lengthen</seg><seg type="columnLine">life almost indefinitely, so the problem of old age need</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be considered. A supply of air and water would, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, be no great problem with the Waterson apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">for electrolyzing CO back to carbon and oxygen, using</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic energy fuel. Water, of course, is merely trans^</seg><seg type="columnLine">muted and recombined and thus automatically purified</seg><seg type="columnLine">for use. A sufficient reserve of very dense materials</seg><seg type="columnLine">could easily be carried that would make up for any losses</seg><seg type="columnLine">by transmutation to the necessary gases. As yet we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not been able to make foods from energy, carbon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and oxygen and hydrogen, but I believe you, Dr. Lange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE METAL HORDE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have made very considerable progress along that line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I intended announcing at this meeting," said Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lange, "the development of a commercial method of</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufacturing any one of the sugars and several pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teins directly from rock or water, by a transmutation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and building-up process. The method has been de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," continued the Martian, "there would be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">need of carrying any great amount of food. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem is settled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "As there would be no resistance encountered in space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">once the machine had been accelerated to its definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of 1000 miles per second, on leaving Sirius it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be able to make the trip across space with no ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penditure of energy, until it reached its goal and slowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the speed of a planet. Hence no great amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of matter-fuel would be needed to drive the machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the problem of heating seems to me to be in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soluble. Interplanetary space we have the radiations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun to depend upon, and they are decidedly suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient, usually superfluously so. But in the infinite depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of interstellar space, there is only darkness and a perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">reservoir for radiations. There would be continuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooling by radiation, and no sun to warm the ship. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could understand how the ship might carry enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter to warm it for one hundred years, but in sixteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years so much energy must be radiated that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire mass would not suffice. Nothing short of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire planet would be sufficient. Polished walls would</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduce the radiation, but still it would be too high. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not understand it--unless these men can endure a</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature of but twenty or thirty degrees above ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solute zero--then they could make it quite readily--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred and forty degrees below zero Centigrade</seg><seg type="columnLine">means that air--nearly everything would be solid, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept a few rare gases. No it seems impossible--yet we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the evidence! I can not understand how they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made this terrible migration, but I know that there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">many different units. I believe two thousand or more</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the number you mentioned Horus Mai ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There seem to be a very considerable number of sep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arate signals that we can distinguish. I consider the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand a very conservative estimate," replied Horus</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mai, the Martian radiation engineer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," continued Mansol Korac, "we must decide</seg><seg type="columnLine">011 some plan of meeting them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Martian sat down and for some time there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence in the great hall. At last President Waterson</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose slowly to his feet. His face showed his concern.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In times of emergency he always felt that these men</seg><seg type="columnLine">here were responsible for the welfare of the twenty bil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions of human beings they controlled. And he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">their leader,^ and therefore the responsibility was his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Mansol Korac, could you point out to us the approxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate location of the approaching ships?" asked Water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and handed him a small hand light and pointed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great map of the system above them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I cannot be very exact, Mr. President; I do not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">their location very definitely, but I should say about here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeding thus." The dazzling beam of white light</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbed up to the ceiling high above, and a sharp circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light a foot across appeared, just within the orbit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uranus, but well beyond Saturn. Then it slowly moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">inward toward tiny glowing Mars. They were within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Solar System, but had not yet reached the Inner</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ring of planets. Doubtless they who could make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip across the great "Void had the energy of matter at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their disposal, and probably the disintegration ray. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have no difficulty with the planetoids, they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely beam them out of existence if they came too near.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The light snapped out, and each member of the cabinet</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned toward Waterson again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Gentlemen, we see that they are within the Solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">System already and appear toi be heading directly for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Inner Ring, and Mars in particular, I do not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether they come in peace or as invaders, but I think I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can reasonably say that they are probably invaders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We all agree that they have made a trip of some 1600</seg><seg type="columnLine">years' duration. We all recognize the difficulty of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trip. There are over two thousand ships in their fleet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would not send so large a fleet to investigate the Outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ring, but to send that great number of ships on a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploration trip of 1600 years--I do not think it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">consistent. Then, too, we must allow them a life span</seg><seg type="columnLine">of over three thousand years if we are going to padmit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this fleet is for exploration, for it would be three</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand two hundred years before they could bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">back news of their trip. In the meantime they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">well have been wiped out by some stellar catastrophe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or they might have developed means of seeing us directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in nine years, the time light takes for the trip. Much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would prefer peace, I fear we must prepare for</seg><seg type="columnLine">war. But we can always go out to meet them peace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, in a great battle fleet. That might convince them</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it is better to deal peaceably with us and it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least be a protection. I suggest that we have a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussion on this, and take a vote."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But there was no discussion, and the vote was unani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous, for the President's suggestion was the logical</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. They had to be prepared for either peace or war.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then came the discussion of weapons. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitifully little to discuss. The interplanetary patrol fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a mere police force, designed to destroy meteors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn comets or asteroids. There was no real naval fleet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But mechanical devices had reached a great peak of per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fection and the little space ships were so cheap, so easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">operated, and so eminently safe, that nearly every family</seg><seg type="columnLine">had several, and new ones were always in. demand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were mighty factories to meet this demand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twenty billion people can absorb a tremendous number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of machines. That was the greatest protection we had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was that quantity production, developed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American, Ford, that made Waterson's campaign pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible. But we were to learn much of quantity production</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods before that war was over!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">/"\RDERS were issued that evening to all the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">V-/ plants over all three planets to begin work on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great quantity of ten-man-high speed ships. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be arranged with mountings for machine guns firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive bullets loaded with material explosive, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">one equal to 100 tons of the old fashioned Dynamite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with special mountings for Dis ray machines. The dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">integration ray machinery was to be built by the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panies employed ordinarily in making private power</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants, hand lights, and the jumping belts. These belts</seg><seg type="columnLine">had small projectors that threw a directional beam of</seg><seg type="columnLine">force that tended to deform the curvature of space, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that point, and the result was a force that pulled the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jector forward, for the space before it acted like a spring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If a magnet be held near a steel watch spring, the spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">will bend, but it will try to straighten out and pull the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnet forward. If the magnet could pass through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring it would progess, as the space curver apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pulled through space. This was the principle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">every ship now built, from these tiny two-kilogram</seg><seg type="columnLine">(nearly live pounds) machines capable of lifting a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air, to the titanic new passenger-freight liners</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying as high as three quarters of a million tons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The principle of the disintegration ray was not greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">different, and so the machines designed for turning these</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in quantities were used to make the Dis ray appara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tus with no great changes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The heat ray projectors were made in quantities for</seg><seg type="columnLine">every purpose, they were used for cooking, for welding</seg><seg type="columnLine">metals, for warming the home, for melting down cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make way for a building or a tunnel for water, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">heating the mighty space ships, for anything to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat might be applied to advantage. These would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">very effective weapons but for the fact that heat rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be reflected. They would bounce off the car of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy without doing any damage if it were polished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as no doubt it would be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Great liners of space were requisitioned and fitted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dis rays, and with mighty attractor beam apparatus that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would grip and hold anything short of another liner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each of the ten-man-cruisers had a smaller attractor</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam by which they could grip an adversary and hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his tail with the tenacious grip of a bulldog and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">not weary the pilot with violent movement. These ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">were exceedingly powerful, and their speed was limited</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by the accelerations the passengers could stand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But all the scientists of the System were working</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately to design some new weapon, some new ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine that was a little faster, a little more powerful;</seg><seg type="columnLine">although with resistance in space and with the tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">energies of matter at their disposal, there was little lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of power as far as the speed of the ships were concerned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ten thousand times more powerful than the titanic en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ergies of atoms, this energy had defeated the Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">that memorable day in May, 1947, and it was a full ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">billion times more powerful than the energies of coal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of oil, of the fuels man had known before that day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they needed a machine that could project the Dis</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray farther. Twenty-five miles was the limit, beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the tremendous electrical field that was used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct it must be built up to so high a voltage that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no practical way of insulating it. They must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied with the twenty-five mile range--but the scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tists were working at increasing the range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had two weeks before the Sirians would reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars, and in those two weeks much was done. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a very carefully laid out system in all notices; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolute truth was laid before the public, but there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">also laid before them the evidences of Man's power.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were no panics.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">element of the unfamiliar was gone, and with it had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">the element that produces panic, that reduces the effi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciency of a nation or of a System.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> New production machines had to be built, new de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs worked out, new dies cut, but it was done with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quickness that a generation of mass production had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made possible, it was not new to them, this change of</seg><seg type="columnLine">design overnight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It required most of those two precious weeks to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great machines working once more at their tasks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at last a steady stream of ten-man cruisers was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing poured out, 5000 an hour, night and day, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">factories of three planets. But there was only one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work before the Invaders would reach Mars, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet was gathered, 120,000 ten-man ships, manned by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the volunteers of three worlds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in the meantime Waterson had had built for him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self a ten-man ship with triple strength of walls, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">triple power plant installation, and an extra energy gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erator. He was experimenting with it, no one knew on</seg><seg type="columnLine">what.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At last the invaders were seen. Far out in their course</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scouts had met them. Those scouts were destroyed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without provocation; they did not even have time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">finish their reports, but we learned enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mars was a deserted planet now. All its population</seg><seg type="columnLine">had moved to the other worlds. Most of them moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Earth, on the other side of the sun. Only the workers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the great factories remained. They were not com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled to. They were told of the danger of their posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, but those factories could contribute 1500 ships an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, and they were manned. The fleet had gathered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars, awaiting the news of the Sirians, when the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port of the scouts was flashed across the ether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They told of a great horde of metal ships, shining,</seg><seg type="columnLine">iridescent, ranging in size from tiny darting machines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet long by one and three-quarters in diameter, mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpedoes, to great transport ships. And there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single spherical ship. A great sphere that floated in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of a bodyguard of the thousands of its followers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were literally hundreds of thousands of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpedo-ships, a few dozen of the cargo ships, and a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships that seemed more like scouts of some sort. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was apparent that the little torpedo-ships were the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighters--tiny ships that spun and turned and darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an electron in ionized gas. It seemed impossible that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man could stand those sudden turns at several miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second, but they watched them, and went into nothing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness as the Dis ray reached out from those tiny ships and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caressed their ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They, too, had Dis rays--it would be a terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle, for man had that same force, a force so deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had feared to use it in industry. But man had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage of numbers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men on the fleet who saw those television plates</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing with the story of what was taking place out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in space decided that those torpedo-ships must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">guided by radio. If they were it would be a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter to wreck that system by using a powerful inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference that wo»ld drown out the directing wave and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make its ships unmanageable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The System Capital was temporarily moved to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waterson Laboratories on Earth.

The System needed them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was midnight on the part of Mars where the SiriaCS</seg><seg type="columnLine">first struck.

These Sirians must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">small men! And they must be from a massive world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a work! that had accustomed them to great accelera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Below them the city was deserted except for vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">projector machines that hummed steadily, automatically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a thousand points. They were broadcasting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">message to the worlds and to the commanding officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other side of Mars. These men had direct con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol of the battle. They could not control it from Earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for radio waves travel too slowly. Twenty minutes each</seg><seg type="columnLine">way the waves took and in forty minutes the battle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than over. It lasted only fifteen minutes--minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of terrific carnage!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As the two great fleets came into contact, the Solarians</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove into the mass of tiny ships, their Dis rays flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every direction. They had one advantage in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they sprayed nine streams of death from each of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft; but the torpedo-ships were so unbelievably fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was nearly impossible to hit them. And they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have no compunction about raying one of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own ships if a more than equal amount of damage was</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflicted on their enemies. Logical, no doubt, but how</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhuman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The sky above the city became a blazing hell of Dis</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays, heat rays, and exploding shells. The explosives</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not safe, for they threw great flying fragments that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could pierce the wall of a ship and send it down. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">damaged friend and foe alike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Solarian fleet had a solid projectile of a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant crystal of copper that was immune to the Dis ray.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It could penetrate the walls of a ship and bring it down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the explosive bombs were more often than not ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded or merely disintegrated before they reached their</seg><seg type="columnLine">goaL A crystal of any sort was immune to the Dis ray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was not a protection against it. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">known way of deflecting the Dis ray except by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">special electrical field that directed it, and that could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made to surround a ship. The copper crystals were</seg><seg type="columnLine">used mainly to destroy the Dis ray projectors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy. They were fired at the faint glow, and with luck</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would hit the machine and instantly wreck the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jector. More than one machine disappeared as its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dis ray projector, wrecked by the fifteen-inch copper</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystal, suddenly spread in all directions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sphere and its escort of transports hung back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by a great number of the torpedo ships.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They did not join in the fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">_ And at last the Solarian fleet was recalled. It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">right that they should make such heavy sacrifices. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">city must fall, and it would be easy to crush the Sirians</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a larger fleet. At the rate of 5000 Solarian ships an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, they might well do so in three days. So the Sola-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rians left, and behind on the ground there were a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships; a great number had been rayed into nothingness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Sirians had won this first victory, but the Solarians</seg><seg type="columnLine">could soon make up for this loss. They had twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">billions to back them up, and they had the resources of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three planets. It seemed as though the invaders could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not last long, but we had yet to learn the true meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mass production.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No man could hang around the encampment of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">alien race. But above them television broadcasts were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended, and some were installed in the buildings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city. But these were of no avail, for the Sirians</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed obsessed with the idea of making Mars a true</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere. They proceeded to level the great city with Dis</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays. No news projector could remain there, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and several news projector men lost their lives. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolhardy to stay in that city; they had been forbidden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but nothing will keep a newsman out of a chance for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoop. The projectors which hung above continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show a weird sccne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great sphere and its attendant transports sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently to the ground and formed a great wheel, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere as the hub and the transports as radiating spokes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rim. High above them the darting torpedo-ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wheeling in constant circles. It seems a miracle</seg><seg type="columnLine">that not all of those news projectors were destroyed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">some did last till the early rays of the sun set them off</seg><seg type="columnLine">as shining targets for the flashing Dis rays. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird scene they showed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now from the sides of the great transports came, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, but great machines, machines that lumbered along</seg><seg type="columnLine">on caterpillar treads to set themselves down beside their</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent ship, one from each ship, and proceeded to dig</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves in, about three feet deep. Then all seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet, except for a steady hum from the great machines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty-eight in all there were, great machines--fully two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet on a side. They worked there quietly now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the men within them must have been totally covered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for they could not be seen. Apparently the Sirians dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">not come out into the Martian atmosphere. And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">something was happening that startled all the billions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchers on the three planets. In the top of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines was a small trapdoor. Through this, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a torpedo-ship that floated up a few feet, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted off to join the wheeling machines above. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">eleven seconds later another came forth--another--each</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine there was sending them out now. One by one</seg><seg type="columnLine">those machines released a torpedo-boat--one every eleven</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds, with the regularity of a clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At first men could not grasp the significance of this--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but soon it became obvious. These wonderful machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">were complete factories in themselves, portable, mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">production factories for producing those torpedo-ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one each eleven seconds came from the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the production line, complete. The noises there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer a gentle hum. There was a whir and rattle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines. It was not loud, though considering the mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">works that must have been going on inside. But stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily now, that darting fleet of torpedo-ships was increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power for all this work was obvious to these men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who used similar processes in their work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the soil below them the machines dug masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of matter, and carrying it up into the machine trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">muted its elements, into the elements necessary to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines, then molded them, and automatically assem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled them. It would require very little supervision, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that production rate was staggering! One each eleven</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds meant 325 completed machines an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There were no signs of any men entering these ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the machines, so it seemed there must be some means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of distant control that man knew nothing of, for it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">improbable that all those men could have been in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent machine from the beginning. No wonder the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sirians could lose these machines so freely. The ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make them automatically from anything meant they</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost practically nothing and could be produced in limit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">less quantity. The notion that Man was to be an easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">victor was fast disappearing. These machines were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming to form an ever-growing cloud of wheeling ships.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still, man had destroyed fully half their fleet in that des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate struggle; they must spend some time in making</seg><seg type="columnLine">up those losses. But Man had lost nearly a third of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great fleet. Four hundred thousand brave men had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost. It was not even a victory, and it had cost Man far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than it had cost the Sirians. They had learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">something from them, though. Perhaps radio control</seg><seg type="columnLine">would enable man to do an equal amount of damage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Orders were put through to make an experimental fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thirty thousand radio-controlled machines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the meantime a new thing was attracting the atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the people on the planets. A new set of</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines was issuing from the transports. These were</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller than that first set--low and squat--but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed far more flexible in their movement. They went</seg><seg type="columnLine">off in orderly line to a point a few miles distant from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main encampment and there formed themselves into</seg><seg type="columnLine">two groups. One group remained still, but began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow faintly, and a hum came to the televisors above.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then there began to flow from a spout on the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each a steady stream of molten metal. This was poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a somewhat similiar arrangement on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">group, then these moved quickly away, and with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange handlike appendages began to work quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a great rounded hull that was rapidly forming. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">men watching understood. It was to be another cargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. Rapidly this hull grew under their swift manipu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation, till it was completed in three and a half hours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An entire ship, except for the machinery, was completed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now they began to work on another, and as they fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work there started from the original cargo shops a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long line of small, quick moving machines, machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could run along the ground or drive through the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were covered with arm-like appendages. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">these reached the newly built hull, and quickly they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">at work, getting material from the strange squat ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines, entering the hull, and working at it. The second</seg><seg type="columnLine">hull was nearly completed when one of the smaller ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines flew back to the original encampment and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the sphere. From it it drew a strange metal case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblong, from which led a great heavy cable. This it</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried back to the now completed ship and installed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere inside. Then the ship rose easily from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground and floated around a bit, landed again, and im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately there came out of it one of the torpedo-ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines! None of these had gone in, it had been made</seg><seg type="columnLine">by those slim, quick worker machines! And now there</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumbered out a second machine--one of the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">hull maker machines--then two of the worker machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out, where only one had gone in. The ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete, even to its strange crew! And now that strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew was already at work, making others!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With the coming of dawn the televisors were rayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of existence. But that evening more were installed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and every night during all that invasion there floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">above them those noiseless televisors. They destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">many, but many remained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That night showed us a fleet of nearly a half million of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny torpedo-ships, and a rapidly growing cargo ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. There were more than a hundred now, for as</seg><seg type="columnLine">each was completed, the machines made could aid in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more rapid construction of the next.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that night they began their work of leveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars. That great fleet spread itself out over all the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of Mars, and with flaming heat rays and the terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dis rays they cut down every remnant of the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills. Twenty-four hours later the entire planet was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast featureless plain. And on that plain there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">established eight camps. During this time the cargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships had been moving, and during that twenty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours they did nothing. But Man was prepared. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio-controlled fleet was ready to be given its first try.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The entire fleet was assembled above the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars, above that original camp, where still rested the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one sphere. Then from far out in space the great con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol ships directed the dive of the radio-control-ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the distance one-twentieth part of a light second.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The men directing the ships were no faster than that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not respond sooner, and the greater distance gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">them greater safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now the radio-controlled ships were released, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted to drop, uncontrolled. They wished to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sirians no warning. Then when the ships were</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely ten miles from the Sirian fleet, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought under control, headed nose down in a power</seg><seg type="columnLine">dive, straight through the surprised upper layers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet, and with Dis rays glowing they drove straight for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ships below. Suddenly, there were great gashes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground beneath, and twenty of the cargo ships were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone in that first rush, and three more followed quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But while literally thousands of the Sirian torpedo-ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been rayed, nearly half of the thirty thousand radio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled ships of Man were gone. And now they had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">apply full power to prevent striking the ground. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-two of them continued'on in straight fall toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great sphere. They were rayed by a hundred ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they could get really separated from their com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions. And now the fast radio ships were destroy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hundreds of the Sirians, they were formed in a verti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal column reaching up ten miles, one above the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the nine Dis ray projectors going full blast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning as rapidly as was safe lest the machines fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart due to centrifugal force, for the Dis ray will work</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically instantaneously. The top ship was prevent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the torpedo-ships' attack from above. Suddenly each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ships stopped spinning; its Dis ray went out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they dropped like rocks. The radio control had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned out by powerful interference; they were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer under the influence of the men, and they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to function. The radio-controlled-ships would no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer be useful against the Sirians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEARLY the entire fleet of the Sirian torpedo-ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been wiped out by that spinning column. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of the manually-controlled ships dove down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the weakened fleet. Every one of the remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships shot up to meet the advancing fleet; there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still several thousand of the torpedo ships. And now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere rose with them, and among them. Suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire mass came together in the shape of a greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere with walls of torpedo-ships, and as it formed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpedo ships snapped on their Dis rays, and started the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire surface of the sphere spinning! They seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">invulnerable in this formation, but they quickly moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">away across the surface of the planet, the larger part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Solarian fleet following, wondering what to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. It seemed impossible to attack the sphere of</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE METAL HORDE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But the cargo ships were left unprotected, and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment they had been beamed out of existence. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sirians had lost many hours' work on this battle! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">they lost more before the mighty fleet of torpedo-ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the other camps rescued them. For now and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">an explosive shell would penetrate the screen of disinte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gration rays. But within the outer shield was a second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">virtually a shield of metal, for the metal sphere was sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by a solid mass of the torpedo-ships. But many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these were destroyed. More, too, were put out of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission by the copper crystals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On the arrival of the great fleet from the other camps</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tables were turned. The control ships had too low</seg><seg type="columnLine">an acceleration, and there were too many ships for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten-man machines to get, though they tried to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen of Dis rays that stopped the ships till they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rayed out of existence. Many of the control ships were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost and many of the ten-man ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was then that Waterson announced two things that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the Solarians new hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was the fifth of August when the announcement</seg><seg type="columnLine">was made. And it was the same day on which nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire fleet from all the camps on Mars started off</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Venus, but the movement was detected almost at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, and from great underground bases on Mars the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solarian fleet sent out fifty thousand ten-man ships.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These ships skimmed along close to the ground, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their polished metal had been sprayed with a drab paint</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that they seemed but shadows that became practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible as they sped along, widely separated, but rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">converging on the site of the Sphere's camp. This had</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained on Mars, guarded by so small a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships that it was evident they expected the Solarian</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet to go to Venus, as no doubt would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary but for this swift counter raid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So perfectly camouflaged were the Solarian ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they got within ten miles of the camp without being</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered. Then, as their Dis rays flashed out, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire group of the torpedo ships dove on them. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were nearly one hundred thousand of the ten-man ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">diving down at them in a zigzag course that made them</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible targets, but the fleet had been approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all sides, and now the entire Sirian defense was</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrating on the machines attacking from the north.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those from the south crept in behind them, and sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly the sphere started into the air, then went flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into space at terrific speed. It barely escaped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dis rays of the attackers. Only its tremendous accelera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion saved it. Now several thousand of the torpedo ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot after it, the rest falling into the form of a great disc</seg><seg type="columnLine">to block the path of the pursuers. Man had long been</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to two dimensional maneuvering, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease with which these Sirians fell into complex three</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensional formations showed long practice in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">art of warfare in space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That raid was successful in that it forced the imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diate return of the Sirian fleet, and very nearly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed the sphere. Over seventy-two thousand of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpedo ships were destroyed, but we lost two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty thousand men. But Waterson an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced that the Sirians would no longer be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape because of their greater acceleration. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered a method for using an attractor beam of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short range but considerable power to be used with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electro-magnetic device that would automatically turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the instruments in such a way that no matter what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the accelerations might be, no matter how great, as long</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they were within the limits of the ship's strength,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the accelerations and centrifugal forces would be in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly neutralized, thus making possible violent maneu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vers that the sudden forces had hitherto made impossible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A demonstration of his new ship had confirmed it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up a number of the Cabinet in his special machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned hairpin turns at ten miles a second! The ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celeration would have been instantaneously deadly had</seg><seg type="columnLine">those neutralizers failed. They might as well have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a half million ton freighter as it landed, as un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dergo those accelerations! But in that perfectly balanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, it was not detectable. The ship's hull was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">triple strength, as were the power projectors, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators. It was powered like a freighter, and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach its full speed of 1,000 miles per second at an ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celeration 5,000 times that of Earth's gravity. Waterson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who weighed two hundred and ten pounds on Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have weighed over five tons! It meant that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solarian fleet would no longer be handicapped by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater flexibility of the enemy ships. The plants that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been manufacturing the machines had already closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down temporarily, while the dies for these new machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being made. But within thirty-six hours the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the machines was being turned out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now a great crew of young men were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered to man them. They were all volunteers. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to be one million ships, and that meant ten million</seg><seg type="columnLine">men would be needed. Only modern methods could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made that possible, but with three populations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">totaling over twenty billions, a sufficient number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">volunteers came forward to make the work easy. As fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">as these men came to the conscription stations, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were put into the new machines. And here also modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods had helped. The Waterson system of material</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy release had been so successful, that the price of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed car had dropped to well under one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars for the small two-man machines.. And even for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interplanetary models not more than two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars needed to be paid, for the raw materials were</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely free, the labor was mechanically reduced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost nothing, and as the energy that drove these ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines was as cheap as the raw materials, they merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged enough to make the venture pay a decent return</seg><seg type="columnLine">on investment and to pay the wages of the few machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">supervisors and the office staff. Men worked five days</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week on three-hour shifts in the factories, but longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours and more pay went to the builders, to the men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to manually control the building construction ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chinery, for law forbade the building of offices on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass production scheme, since that meant an unvaried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">monotonous city. But everywhere wages were high, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">wages depend, not on the amount of work men do, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the amount of finished product they can turn out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The men accomplished more, and were paid more, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they worked less. It had taken many years to finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">convince the Earth of that, but the example of American</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor, with its shorter hours and higher wages was proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. And then the influence of the mighty energies</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waterson had released made it even more apparent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars had already developed the system under the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the released atomic energies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> High wages and cheap machines had meant that every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one owned one. And so absolutely safe were they that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they commanded perfect confidence. This had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big factor in the making of this mighty fleet. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one knew how to operate the machines, so it was easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fill the places on the machines with pilots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless, special training was necessary to over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come the caution against quick turns that long experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence had instilled in them all. Each accepted applicant</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taken tip in one of the new machines, and given a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath-taking ride--a ride that consisted in diving to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the Earth with terrific sudden acceleration. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just when the student felt certain they would crash and</seg><seg type="columnLine">become a mass of molten metal, the ship was brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, not a mile from the ground, to settle gently; then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they almost touched the ground, they leapt into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air again with an acceleration that shot them out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the atmosphere with the velocity of a meteor, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer wall of tungsto-iridium alloy glowed cherry</seg><seg type="columnLine">red. Then came sharp turns at ten or twenty miles a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, till at last the students no longer gripped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms of their seats in anticipation of a sudden accelera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Then they were taken down and given a ship to</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But none of these men had ever handled a weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sort they were to use, so. mimic battle practice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was held, with the glowing rays of a harmless ionizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam instead of the deadly Dis rays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DAILY reports were coming from the Martian scouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">as time went on. The Sirians, too, had decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do some fleet building, for nearly three-quarters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fleet had been destroyed. The production rate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's factories, 120,000 a day, had gained a slight lead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would require ten days before a fleet of a million</seg><seg type="columnLine">could leave for Mars with a home guard of two-hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The destruction of the Martian plants had lowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the production rate to about 3,500 an hour, but shops</seg><seg type="columnLine">put up rapidly on Earth and Venus had quickly brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the production-rate back, and it would be nearer 7,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour by the time the last of the fleet had been finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spinning sphere formation of the Sirians had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost invulnerable, and an exceedingly destructive</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation. The Solarians had chosen several thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their crack pilots to practice this maneuver, but de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite almost constant practice during the entire ten days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a miserable failure as soon as they tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress. Standing motionless it was a very effective</seg><seg type="columnLine">procedure, but the spinning column was decided on as</seg><seg type="columnLine">more effective as long as they had no ship to protect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were twenty groups that practiced that maneuver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Waterson announced that an associate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his, working in his laboratory, had developed a method</seg><seg type="columnLine">for using a triple electrical field to direct the Dis ray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making possible a ray with a range of over sixty miles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This would be absolutely fatal to the spinning sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">system of the Sirians. The Sirians very evidently did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know how to project the Dis ray any further than</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five miles. The ability to stand off and hit them</seg><seg type="columnLine">would break down the sphere of Dis rays very quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was only one objection. The rays were very</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful, so powerful that they required triple power</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators, but the special field of electrical force was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worst problem. The field could not be made suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficiently strong if a single layer of the force was used,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the invention of a method to back up the first with</seg><seg type="columnLine">two other layers of equal voltage, thus getting nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">three times the effect without exceeding the capacity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insulation, had made the new machine possible. This</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">special field was produced by circularly moving cathode</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays, or exceedingly high velocity electrons, and there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore could be produced only by atomic methods. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant ten thousand times the amount of fuel a simi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larly powered material engine would have required,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but material energy of course yields only wave motions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the transient or unstatic type, a type that cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand still. Atomic energy can yield static-waves as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as unstatic; the electron can stand still, and is a perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">example of the stationary wave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These limitations, in turn, meant that a tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of equipment was needed. And a corresponding</seg><seg type="columnLine">great volume of space was required. In the end they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to use specially reinforced freighters to carry the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great projectors, each of which could carry but two</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectors. Due to their long range, however, the ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at least self-protecting. There was not time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make and equip more than twenty-eight of these ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the fleet was scheduled to start. They were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted ahead of time. Some of their trial trips more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than fulfilled the best hopes of the inventor. Dr. Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liam Carson, the physicist who developed it insisted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was really Dr. Waterson's suggestions that made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had learned something of spatial warfare forma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions from the Sirians. Now we were to learn a bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strategy of spatial warfare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Solarian fleet sailed for Mars on the fifteenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of August, 1961. They were a scant twenty mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion miles from their goal when a report came from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scout that something was happening down in the Sirian</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. Almost immediately after that the Sirians flooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">our entire system with so terrific a barrage of radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequency static that communication was impossible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They could not transmit from Earth to Venus, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication was very poor even from one side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth to the other, despite the fact that over a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">billion kilowatts were used. So intense was this barrage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if two of the torpedo ships near the sending ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus came within twenty or thirty feet of each other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">great crashing sparks leapt across, and instantly they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fused. Scouts saw this happen twice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Solarian fleet continued on for Mars. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">should cover the remaining distance--twenty million</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles--in five hours by pressing the ships a little, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though higher speeds made the rate of approach of</seg><seg type="columnLine">asteroids so great that they frequently could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">detected before they collided with the ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only two and a half hours later a scout came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight at terrific speed. He must have been doing over</seg><seg type="columnLine">two thousand a second, an exceedingly dangerous rate--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his acceleration neutralizer enabled him to slow down</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely. He reported that the entire Sirian fleet had risen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Mars, leaving a very few machines behind--this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time taking the sphere with them--and had set out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth! Earth was on the other side of the Sun--a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred and twenty million miles to go! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sirians had a lead of three hours. They had as great a</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed as the Solarians and would reach Earth bef ',--rfhe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solarians. But they would at least be delayed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred thousand ships--more now, for the steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">production would have built the quota up to over six</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred thousand, or a million by the time they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">return. The Sirian fleet had been built up to nearly three</seg><seg type="columnLine">million though, which could easily crush the fleet of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE METAL HORDE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">million, and the second million later--separately. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip would take them sixty-two hours. Scouts had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent ahead to Earth at a dangerously high speed to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municate the news, and the entire fleet had increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">its speed to a rate that was considerably higher than</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety warranted, but a continuous play of Dis rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">was considered sufficient safety at fifteen hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second. The Sirian fleet had been reported to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">making thirteen hundred and fifty, so the Solarians</seg><seg type="columnLine">should pass them, or meet them, just shy of the Earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the other fleet would be waiting. They should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no difficulty to crush the Invaders with the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">million ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The radio interference was being maintained by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship anchored somewhere in space. It was no doubt well</seg><seg type="columnLine">protected, and to attack it successfully would have meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loss of a large number of ships, for the time spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the attack would delay them irreparably. They must</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue to Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There were no scouts from the Sirian fleet--yet there</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been, for over a thousand ships had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">following them, far behind. None ever reached Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to warn the fleet. Every one of them was destroyed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But when the Sirian fleet was well on its way--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned--and headed for Venus! They had purposely</seg><seg type="columnLine">let that one scout reach the Solarian fleet with the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the fleet was headed for Earth--then they redirected</seg><seg type="columnLine">their course. The scouts from the Solarian fleet did</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach Earth--but soon after the last of the scouts fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing the Sirian fleet had been destroyed, their radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrage was lifted. All the ships on Venus were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated on Earth, and Venus was left unprotected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty hours after the fleet had turned back, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio barrage was again lowered over the System. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ten hours later that the Sirians reached Venus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the radio barrage had been lifted, Waterson</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had an idea that there should be some protection</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the planet. It did not seem that the planet should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be completely stripped of its defenses, and he had sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested that at every city great Dis ray machines of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty-mile range type be set up. His suggestion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed, and at every city on Venus the great machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">were installed. There were many of them now, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the hundred hours the main fleet was in flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new machines had been put on a quantity produc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion basis. But all the ships that were equipped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, were sent to the defense of the unattacked Earth!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it was those machines that prevented the landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Sirians. They came to the night side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, of course, coming from Mars. It would be thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours before they would be expected on Earth--thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours before the main fleet would reach the planet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then there would be the 160,000,000-mile trip to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus if they were to get there in time to rescue the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the Sirians could not approach within beaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance of the cities, and all those that did try to do so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, brought down as a cloud of powdery dust. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waterson's caution that saved the billions of people on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But were they to be saved ? The Sirians decided they</seg><seg type="columnLine">must destroy the works and the people on Venus, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">they made one desperate effort. They had at least sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours to work in, and now they had a plan that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">require time. They retired some hundred miles from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, then the entire fleet, torpedo ships, cargo boats,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and the entire body guard of the Sphere lined up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then switched on powerful attractor beams. Imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately, the combined effect of over three million of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">emanations took hold on the planet, and great tides</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to rise in its mighty oceans. Many lives were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in the seaside towns, when the tremendous waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed in over the land. But astronomers on the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most of the System's scientists were there to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sirians on Mars through their great telescopes. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">these astronomers saw what the Sirians intended, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that they were well on their way to fulfilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">their aim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A PLANET is balanced in its orbit about its parent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sun with the delicacy of a diamond on a jeweler's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scales. But, like the diamond, if it be displaced by some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">force, it reaches a new state of equilibrium. Thus, if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the diamond is further lowered in the scale by adding a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">small weight, it soon reaches a new point of equilibrium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">No conceivable force, therefore, could be great enough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to displace the planet in its orbit more than a few million</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">miles by pulling it either in toward the sun, or out from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it, and as soon as that force was released, it would spring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back to its original position as the diamond would regain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">its balance on removing the disturbing weight. For the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sun pulls on a planet with a titanic force; it draws it in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the apparent force gravity, and another similar,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but opposite force, centrifugal force of its revolution in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">its orbit, is constantly tending to throw it into the depths</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of space. These are the two forces that are always bal-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">anced. Suppose the planet is drawn nearer the sun; it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">revolves in a smaller orbit -- and it revolves in that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">smaller orbit with a higher speed--for it has fallen in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">toward the sun; it has gained speed as any falling body</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would. It has gained speed in the direction of the sun,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but this has operated to increase its rotational speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Thus it has gained a greater centrifugal force--you can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">see the effect with a bit of chalk on the end of a string.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The smaller the circle it swings in, the greater the ten-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dency to fly outward. But as long as we continue the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">force that was added to draw it in, it will remain in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">equilibrium. Remove this extra force and at once the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">planet will fall away from the sun, losing speed as it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">does so, till it has reached a point where it is once more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in equilibrium with the force drawing it inward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now reverse the problem. Let us draw it away from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the sun. Now the orbit is longer, and it has lost speed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in moving from the sun. It cannot stay here, it is not in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">equilibrium, unless the force that drew it out is main-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tained. To free the planet from the sun, one would have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to lift hundreds of quintillions of tons of rock through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">billions of miles, against the terrific gravity of the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It is too much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus we see that as long as the planet revolves in its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">orbit, it will never fall, and to pull it away from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sun is impossible as long as it revolves in its orbit. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if it slows down in its flight about the sun it at once has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">less centrifugal force. It automatically falls toward the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sun until it has gained velocity enough to establish a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">new orbit of equilibrium. If this energy, too, is with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drawn ; if it is made to stand still in its orbit; it will fall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">straight to the sun. It is the only way such a thing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">might be done. And it would take the energies of matter,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and strain that to the utmost, to accomplish it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the plan of the Sirians. Three million ships</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were dragging like a Titanic brake on the planet as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">16</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wheeled in its orbit, and slowly, steadily it was falling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the blazing furnace of the sun. Their ships were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not designed for this task, but they could do it in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sixty hours at their disposal. In a short time it would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be falling directly toward the sun, but it would take</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">many hours for the seventy-million-mile fall. Even if it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were stopped before it reached the sun, any place within</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">twenty million miles would be unbearable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the distressed planet itself that warned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people on Earth and the men of the fleet that the Sirians</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never reach Earth, for the radio was still dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the fleet turned for Venus at once. They were far</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one side of the path to Venus, and they would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn, but it would take them thirty, instead of sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours to reach Venus. And the other fleet was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Earth. They were not quite a million strong, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">those machines that had been produced on Venus would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come also, and that would bring the total numbers up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to over a million, and with the main fleet the number</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be well over two million. There were also three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred of the long range Dis ray ships now, for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">more had been produced and Venus would supply an</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal number.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE can only admire the wise action of the Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandant of the Venerean fleet, Mals Hotark, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">not sending his pitiful fleet of a few thousand out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight with the Sirians. The members wanted to, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of Venus wanted him to, but he wisely waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he saw the fleets of the System approaching. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have done no good, and lost many lives, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable ships to have gone in advance to the attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many people tried to leave Venus, but enough ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines were freed of the task of stopping the orbital</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion of the planet to patrol the heavens and keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people from leaving. They beamed thousands of private</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars out of existence; it seemed unnecessarily cruel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The two great fleets were drawing nearer to the planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">converging, and at last they got so close that they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry on a radio communication by using the terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of over two billion kilowatts of energy'. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of power that Sirian machine was throwing off</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been estimated at a minimum of fifty billion kilo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">watts. We know that enough power could be picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from a hundred meter aerial on Earth to operate a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, high frequency motor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When radio communication was established, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed to wait until they could join, for the fleet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth was two hours ahead of the main fleet. The loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time was made up for in greater efficiency of action.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would need it all. At last they joined fleets, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty disc of two million airships, they flew on through</seg><seg type="columnLine">space at a steady rate of five and three-quarter million</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles an hour. They arranged themselves in a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">cone as they came nearer Venus. Already the machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">had slowed it down so greatly that the planet was over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a million miles out of her orbit, and rapidly adding to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this mileage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now as the great cone approached, the great ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the long range Dis rays leading, they were dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered. The cone formation was chosen, for that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three dimensional equivalent of the two dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">V that man had used in war on earth for thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now began the greatest battle in the history of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">System. Here were two mighty forces slashing at each</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">other with terrific disintegration rays, fighting in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great Void, and five million powerful ships darting</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, slashing, stabbing with a death that struck with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quickness of light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the great cone of the main fleet attacked from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, there was a smaller cone attacking the Sirians from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other, but long before the Sirians could bring their</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays into effect the long range rays had torn great holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their ranks. The Sphere had retired with its escort</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once, going swiftly to Mars. The main fleet was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">busily engaged in fighting the Sirians' main fleet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry about the Sphere at present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dozen times the great spinning sphere formation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tried by the Sirians, but each time a withering blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the long range Dis ray cut it up as a tool held against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spinning block of wood cuts it down in the lathe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their strongest formation was useless, and they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer outmaneuver the Solarians, the new ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">could turn and dart as quickly as they, or even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. The big Dis ray ships were not equipped for</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast fighting, so when there were none of the spinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere formations to break up, they retired to a safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance, and waited for any ships that might attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Few did. It proved suicidal. But steadily the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces of man were conquering. In a hell of flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dis rays, the new ships were proving their worth. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming rays had seared the land below for many miles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the fleet of the Sirians was fast going. The new</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast ships of man could dodge the rays of the Sirians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn and dart on the tail of their attacker, then hang</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, the attractor beam giving them an added grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they could flash the machine into nothingness with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Dis ray. They turned, ducked, darted ahead with</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific speed, suddenly stopped, and then were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">full speed again. And another Sirian ship was gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now it was the delicate apparatus of the Sirians' ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">that suffered; they could not keep up with the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns of this flexible adversary. And their great fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been reduced to a scant quarter million, but we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost nearly a half million ships, five million men, in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Titanic struggle. Such a battle cotdd not last long. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impossible. Nothing could stand before the Dis</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays, and with those turning, darting ships, sooner or</seg><seg type="columnLine">or later every ship must come under the influence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those rays. But now the last of the torpedo-ships were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleeing into space. But we did not care to have to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">them again--and they too were rayed out of being.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They could no longer dart away from us before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could catch them--that was for us now!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now the fleet returned to a greater task. Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been falling toward the sun, and was nearly a mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion and a quarter miles off and within her orbit. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great fleet of cargo carriers from Mars, Venus and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth came up, and with them came wrecker ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of picking up 011 their powerful attractor beams</seg><seg type="columnLine">an entire million-ton passenger-freight liner--great liners</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves, all equipped with attractor beams. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were all using their power to bring the planet back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its normal speed. It did not take the ships of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty fleet, many specially designed for heavy listing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and towing, many designed for tremendous loads, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">long to bring the planet back to its age-old orbit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In former days we would have found a world wrecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by panic. BuLthis later generation had learned to trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the powers of the ships they had, and there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">little of the terrible panic that would have affected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE METAL HORDE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">17</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">world of a generation ago. Then, too, they knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the demonstrated power of the long range Dis rays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could safely convoy a fleet of the great passenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">liners to safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What helped also was the fact that the human mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot grasp the full significance of the fall into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun. If you were told that the planet you were on was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinking toward the sun, you would be surprised, horri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied, and would probably try to make a bargain-buy on</seg><seg type="columnLine">real estate, while the other man sold his to get his money</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. You would simply fail to comprehend the magni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude of the catastrophe. It has never happened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">never will, the mind says, and we unconsciously believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Your neighbor would joke about it to you. Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">many would leave, but most people would stay till the</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual physical heat of the sun drove them off. We are</seg><seg type="columnLine">constituted that way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now the radio barrier was down, and news from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martian scouts made men hesitate. The remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargo ships had settled on Mars and were even now</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring out their strange crews. But they were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">building cargo ships. Every one of the worker machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">were kept in action constructing duplicates of themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">as rapidly as possible. Already a great number of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been made--over seven hundred of the machines it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was estimated--and now these were engaged in similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. The number grew in a steady geometrical series.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the scouts were driven away by the torpedo ships.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then there was no news of the operations until night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall permitted the scouts to creep up and install the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating vision machines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then at last we understood the reason for this tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous number of inoffensive worker machines. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a great seething mass of metal around the workings</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Great blazing lights illuminated the scene as</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly as day. There was a great horde of shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal machines working swiftly about the great plain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There seemed to be thousands of them now, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all busily at work on great machines--the torpedo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship machines! There must have been nearly a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand already completed and already the fleet that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped had been built up to many thousands by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly working machines, and a steady stream of long</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistening shapes rose--only to be lost in the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond. Steadily the great machines were being put to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, and steadily the great fleet was being augmented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before morning that fleet had reached two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand, and was now growing at the rate of twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five thousand an hour. Steadily this rate was increasing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fleet was too large to be attacked by man's weakened</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet, for the delay in putting Venus back in its orbit</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given the Sirians a chance to build up an invulner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able fleet. The added time of the trip to Mars meant a</seg><seg type="columnLine">still greater fleet. Already their production rate was far</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater than Man's. Man could not hope to compete</seg><seg type="columnLine">successfully. We were learning the meaning of quantity</seg><seg type="columnLine">production.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had it been possible to attack them with the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">range Dis rays it would have been tried, but the plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hopeless. Before the fleet could reach them there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be 100,000,000 miles to go to reach them, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take approximately twenty hours, in which time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the present rate of increase, the Sirian fleet would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have reached a total of three million again. They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">all concentrate their attack on the long range Dis ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships. No Solarian ships could help without interfering</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with the action of the Dis ray ships, and they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">need help, for each ship carried only two beams. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be carried. They would merely be held at bay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to attack their goal, useful only in breaking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spinning sphere formation, but that could be pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented. The Solarians had learned that trick from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sirians. The Sirians had succeeded in breaking up every</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning column formation by simply getting into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of it before it was formed completely. It required</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect coordination of several machines to do it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was always done. The long range Dis rays were excel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent now in defending a city, but useless for attack be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the terrific weight of the apparatus. They could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not attack the Sirian fleet. If they did the production</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines would have been so built up by the time they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the planet that any ordinary rate of destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be easily equaled by the production! Within</seg><seg type="columnLine">three days it was decided that the Sirian fleet would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">built up enough to attack. .They would then attack our</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets, no doubt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A CABINET meeting was called at the Waterson</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratories on Earth. There Waterson first dem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onstrated the weapon that finally conquered in the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific struggle. Before the members, on the Cabinet table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a small portable material energy disintegrator, a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine that gave off its energy as light. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second machine at the other end of the table, a machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">that occupied about two cubic feet of space, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side of it was a small switch and a dial; on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a familiar looking projector.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Waterson spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen of the Cabinet: I have here a new ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine that my laboratory has developed. I will demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strate its action first." The light was switched on, throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a brilliant shaft of light against the ceiling. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waterson snapped on the switch of the new machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there appeared a strange beam of blueish, ionized</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. But unlike any other known ionizing beam, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot through with streamers of red fire, long, hair-thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamers that wavered and flickered in the blue tube of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ionized air. It reached out, touched the light gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erator, and passed on, through a series of plates of dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent materials. But the instant that strange beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the light-machine, it went out. Then a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, when the new machine was turned off, the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped back on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen, this machine will produce a field, direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional in this case, that will so modify the properties of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space as to make it utterly impossible to disintegrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter into energy. There is some tendency to fix energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">as matter. I think that will be interesting to us in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">event that this war is successfully concluded. But at</seg><seg type="columnLine">present we are interested in the properties of the beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that it will stop the disintegration of matter. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">process depends on the modification of the properties</seg><seg type="columnLine">of space. It is well known that in ordinary space, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we know, there are twenty coefficients of curvature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In ordinary empty space, ten of these have zero values,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ten principal coefficients have certain non-zero</seg><seg type="columnLine">values. This machine so affects space that it makes all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coefficients of space have non-zero values, and fixes</seg><seg type="columnLine">these values to suit its own purposes. The results are</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing. I have done some things with this machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">that makes me truly afraid. But we are interested in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">because certain of the values we can assign operate to</seg><seg type="columnLine">18</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">force space to take such curvatures, that any change</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the condition of matter to condition of energy is</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible. On release of the ray, the space returns to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its normal curvature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Working out the theory of this machine has been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous task. Even the great calculating machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new integraph developed last year, and it is a far</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry from that first one that M. I. T. developed in 1927,</seg><seg type="columnLine">required many weeks of work to solve the problem in</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty coefficients of space. In so doing at one stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had to assume a space of twenty dimensions in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the correct values in the four true dimensions might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be determined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there is still a great deal of work to be done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We must develop practical machines of a range of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles. There is no difficulty in using the ray, since, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is a condition of space, not a vibration, it is impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop it by any shield. There is only one way to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it, to create it directionally. We make the field by</seg><seg type="columnLine">projecting certain strains along a beam, then once started</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field follows that line to a distance dependent on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of the generator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But this will require at least five days to get into</seg><seg type="columnLine">working form. I suggest that in the meantime Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes several million of the long range Dis ray projec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors, and distribute them all over the planet, to be turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on from a central station, or by their own separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">crews. I have no doubt that the Sirians will attack that</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet before we are ready to attack them. Earth, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be prepared. But in the meantime we can begin</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work on the new de-activating field projectors, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">call them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Waterson was right. It was three days later that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sirian fleet left for Venus with a number of torpedo</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships so tremendous, it is absolutely inconceivable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were over two hundred million of the ten-man ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines! When they started to settle about Venus, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky was so filled with them that it was literally dark for</seg><seg type="columnLine">many miles. They attacked at Horacoles the System</seg><seg type="columnLine">Capital, but the fields of the great Dis rays were too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much for them. Neither bombs nor Dis rays could reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. The air was dense, and filled with artificial</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke to prevent the transmission of heat rays and</seg><seg type="columnLine">great winds were created for the purpose of carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heat away; but this was done automatically by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanding air before long. They could not attack the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. All over the face of the planet were the great Dis</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray emplacements. Great ships hung even over the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling oceans, sending the blue rays of ionized air up</seg><seg type="columnLine">like some column thaj: was to hold the Sirians from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Planet. And they did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now again they began to slow down the planet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not gently as they had had to before--but rapidly. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet would have been pulled to pieces, except that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very attractor beams that were pulling on it tended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to relieve the stress. But the cargo ships of Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pulling to keep the planet in motion. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange thing to contemplate! Two mighty forces, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fleet of two hundred million small ships, the other a</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of as many thousand huge freight carriers, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tug-o-war for a planet! But the odds were too great.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly the Sirians won. The planet was steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping toward the sun. Now it seemed no fleet could</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to aid them, and the Sirian fleet was being aug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented constantly by a steady stream of ships from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars. It was the sixth day after the announcement was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">made that Waterson had a fleet ready to attack the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sirians. The Venerians also had a fleet ready, prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the directions of Waterson's engineers sent by radio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">television and radiophone. They were ready to attack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Terrestrian fleet arrived at Venus just six days</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the announcement of the new weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The practical projector of this new ray had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite heavy, and they had been mounted in groups of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty projectors on special hundred-man ships, using</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same acceleration neutralizer used on the ten-man</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships. They were arranged to throw a wide beam, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide that the new ships with twenty, could prevent any</seg><seg type="columnLine">action in a field of over two hundred miles depth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a cone with a base of six hundred miles diameter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ships they had could approach within a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles of the Sirian fleet, without being seen, for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were painted black therefore and showed no lights. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness of the void they were easily hidden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE entire expedition went as planned. The radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrage had not been turned on, and they were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant communication with the Venerians. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleets were to attack simultaneously, over different areas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that between them they could wipe out so large a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of the enemy ships that the fleet of two million</seg><seg type="columnLine">could easily handle the task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hidden in the utter dark of the void they crept up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sirians. They were in the sunlight, but the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">coating kept them invisible, while the Sirian ships shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliantly. Then at last the tip of the great cone forma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was within 6asy striking distance of the fleet. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out the strange ray, and here in space it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly invisible. But suddenly the ships within its range</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to waver, to fall together under mutual gravita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. With one swoop they all shot toward the ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">in space that had paralyzed them, for the attractor beams</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been turned on them. As the great mass of ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell rapidly toward them, long range Dis rays reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and they melted into clouds of shimmering dust.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great swaths were cut through their ranks. A similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene was taking place far to the left of the Terrestrian</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet where the Venerian fleet was working havoc among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the invaders. Now the last of the ships had been rayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into nothingness and a great fleet of the Sirians were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing forward to attack for the ships invisible on</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of their black line had been electrostatically lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated now. But as the Sirians came within one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles of the other fleets, the ships all ceased to accelerate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to change direction; they just drifted straight into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">cone of Dis rays. All walls of the de-activating field</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lined with the ten-man ships, their shorter range</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dis rays prevented any Sirians from escaping. Bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights shone out on the Solarian fleet now--they wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sirians to attack. The original cone formation had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted rapidly; now it was a double cone; then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed to a quadruple cone. There were six hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the de-activator ships and these were arranged so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they shot their rays off in four directions, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">four cones of de-activated space, with the fleet of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">activator ships at the apex. Thus they were protected</seg><seg type="columnLine">on all sides, and quickly, as the Sirian fleet spread out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more ships rose and there were six cones branching out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the center rested the main mass of the fleet, the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">range Dis ships, their attractors pointing out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cones to draw the disabled ships of the Sirians into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">range of their Dis rays, emanating in thousands from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE METAL HORDE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ships lining the sides of the de-activated cones of space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fleet was invulnerable and so sudden and complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the failure of their power in these de-activated</seg><seg type="columnLine">regions, that they did not seem to have time to warn</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fellows. Many millions of the ships were lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the wild charge could be checked; then the six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cone formation entire began to move slowly around; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sirians, waiting to see what was to happen, were caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they were aware that they were in danger. Many,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, were caught by the powerful attractor beams of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy ships within--drawn in by the greater power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the heavy ship, till their power failed. But at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sirians had learned the effective range of this new</seg><seg type="columnLine">power and tried hard to avoid it. The six-cone forma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was immediately broken up, and the six hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">de-activators went out individually, each followed by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarm of the ten-man ships to disintegrate the ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught in the de-activating cones. The Terrestrian ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">were marked by a blazing blue light, so that if they too</seg><seg type="columnLine">were caught in the de-activating field, they were not dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">integrated. Only those around them were, and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">then released, as the ray did not seem to have any in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jurious effects on man, except to give him strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams. In some way the brain was stimulated by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray, as long as the ray was used.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The de-activator ships were completely self-protecting;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could stop any number of attackers from any direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, provided the paralyzed ships were disintegrated as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as caught, for if too many were piled up, the ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dency of the matter to disintegrate in the engines, plus</seg><seg type="columnLine">the natural tendency of the space to resume the normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">curvature, caused the ray to become ineffective as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was overpowered, and one ship was lost in this way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Too many ships piled up, and only part of them could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be rayed out by the ship itself, and there were not a suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficient number of helping ten-man ships. But the mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet of the Sirians was-already beaten. They still out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbered us ten to one, but they could not fight this</seg><seg type="columnLine">new force. They began a running fight to Mars, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now the Solarians were united. Rapidly they wiped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edges of the fleet, and gradually worked in toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center. But the Sirians could not fight back--they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could use only the explosive shells, and few of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached their goal. They were disintegrated, or missed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not more than three thousand men were lost in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire engagement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now the Solarians tried a plan to capture the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sphere. A large number of the ten-man ships dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the main fleet, but not enough to make it notice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to the hard-pressed Sirians. These were joined by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred of the de-activator ships. Then these, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of higher speeds than the main fleet, set out at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the highest speed that could safely be maintained, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted toward Mars. Undetected they rushed past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sirian fleet and passed on toward Mars. They reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet fully three hours ahead of the main fleet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the time the main fleet had arrived, it came unat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended, for the last of the mighty fleet of two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">million torpedo-ships had been turned to impalpable</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust, floating in space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The advance guard arrived without warning, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had expected, found the Sphere resting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, protected by a great fleet of the torpedo-ships.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were nearly a million ships there, with the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines rapidly making more. However, all were</seg><seg type="columnLine">grouped in an area that could be covered by the cone of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the de-activating beam. And out in space, the ship com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manders decided on a plan. Fifty of the de-activator</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet took positions high above the Sirians, and the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">went with the entire fleet of the ten-man ships. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to approach the camp from the ground. Lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the ground, they would be hard to see in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappearing light. At a fixed moment, all the ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">above were to turn on their de-activator rays, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be plainly visible in the Martian atmosphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the ground fleet of fifty de-activators were to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">their rays from the side. The ten-man ships were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">form a circle around the camp at a safe distance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the de-activator rays, for they would crash when their</seg><seg type="columnLine">power failed, if they were caught by the de-activator</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays. But they wanted to capture the sphere in good</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition, so they arranged to have the space directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">above it unaffected by the de-activator field, lest some</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpedo fall on it and destroy it. This would leave an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exit for the torpedo ships, except that at a point a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so above the Sphere, a cross-ray made escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rays were turned on. Instantly the fleet of nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a million torpedo-ships fell wildly out of control, down</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the blue glowing air, in which great streamers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of glowing red seemed to waver and twist. Just outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curtain of destruction waited the entire Solarian</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet. Slowly they closed in till their Dis rays swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the ships within sixty miles of the edge out of exis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tence; then rapidly the de-activator beams were forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever sharper and sharper, till at last only the Sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a few hundred of the torpedo-ships, several hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the torpedo-ship constructors, and the corresponding</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargo ships and worker machines were left. These had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been saved for investigation by the scientists, for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were helpless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the war was over now. The Sirians had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed, or reduced to mere museum pieces. Now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scientists came to investigate the Sphere. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">much we wanted to learn from the creatures of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sphere. But it was a strange story that the Sirian sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to tell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AEONS ago there lived on a great planet of Sirius</seg><seg type="columnLine">a race of intelligent men, shaped as we are, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller due to the greater gravity of their planet. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">these men had developed a high civilization, a civiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion different from ours, in that they learned early about</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanics, but chemistry and physics merely developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the needs of the great mechanical engineers. Elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity was used as a powerful aid in their machines, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their processes; it was a by-product, not an end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually their machines eliminated more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their work; they became more and more complicated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but more and more trustworthy. Men began to experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment with physics and found that their calculating ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines needed development. It was easy to add first</seg><seg type="columnLine">one step, then the next. More and more the machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do. The mathematics became more and more com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicated, and the machines developed the equations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">found they could not handle them and passed them out</seg><seg type="columnLine">as unfinished results. Finally one man used the machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">to calculate the design of a machine that would be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do these new .equations. He built it, but the calcula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions were wrong. The machine had correctly solved his</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem, but he had stated it wrong. It resulted in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine that would solve only simple problems, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES %</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">did something no other machine had ever done. Given</seg><seg type="columnLine">irrelevant data it would choose the correct facts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">solve the problem. It was a step, a short step toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">a machine that really thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Progress thereafter was rapid. The machines built</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines, had been doing it for decades in fact, but now</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did one thing more--they designed them. Now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem could describe the type of machine needed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the worker machine would design it, and turn out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the completed machine! But these machines were rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfecting the beginning that man had made. Within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">decade after that first discovery of the principles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical thought the machine was made that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only solve problems, but could also originate them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had developed a brain. It was a great machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which occupied an entire building, with its massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">framework bolted down to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Man began a rapid decline, for the machines did all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his work. With the construction of a machine that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">originate a problem, man made a mistake. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">created a machine that was more powerful than he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except that it was immobile. And this machine originated</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new machine, a machine that would release the energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of matter! It had developed this because it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to see that such energy existed. Man's machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have solved it long ago, but the problem had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been stated. Now came a machine that could state its</seg><seg type="columnLine">own problems--and solve them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with this new energy it designed a new brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine. A brain machine such as no man's brain could</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceive--a machine that could move! For it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">powered by the energy of matter, and could move as no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other machine had ever moved before--out into space!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still the machines worked for the Sirian man, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned of the new discovery, and began to design a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new brain machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of the Sirians realized the danger that was fac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them, and they had continued long researches on</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's brain, and at last had discovered the secret of</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving a machine that emotion we call devotion, loyalty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or gratitude. And they built a great machine on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle and used material energy to power it. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a success. It could think original thoughts. It pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the danger of the existing machines -- they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger than man. It was only man's mobility and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability to control all mobile machines that had made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior, for a brain without a tool, or body is helpless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now that was lost. The existing brain-machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be destroyed, and new ones built, using the prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciples that it was designed on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the mischief was done. The new brain-machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed by a machine, had done it. A machine had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">built that was controlled by thoughts, a machine that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be controlled by the machines. Each of these ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines was given a small brain, equipped with televisor</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight and hearing, and it was powered by material</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy. Jhey could run for years without outside care,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the thinking machinery they had was sufficient to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep them oiled, and to make them seek repairs when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were damaged. They were susceptible to thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces, and did as the thought waves suggested and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported to «the control brain exactly what was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now this new brain developed a space-flyer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry these machines, and man could not help knowing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for its every thought was rec'orded, for man's use. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one day this record was found destroyed. The next day</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brain machine had left the planet, and taken with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it the new space-flyer and the new telepathically con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolled machines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the outermost planet of the System of Sirius the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great machine fled. For years it remained there waiting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking. Then at last it called its worker machines into</seg><seg type="columnLine">action. A new machine grew up from the stores of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal that the space ship had brought with it, at last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal was used up, and the machine was not completed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so the space-flyer was sacrificed for the completion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine. The new machine was started. From its</seg><seg type="columnLine">lip-like spout there poured a steady smooth stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">molten metal, and the rock on which it rested was eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. The first transmuting metal producer was made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Decades passed, and only a small percentage of man</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed. The rest sank deeper and deeper into a life</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ease. The planets were all explored by the hardy ones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no trace of the brain-machine was ever found, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had discovered the Dis fay, and sunk deep into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, hollowing a great cave to live and work in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT back on that planet, the scientists had developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines that surpassed it in power, and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of these picked up a thought message from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant machine that told its story. It was a thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had not been consciously radiated, only the mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velous sensitivity of this new machine could have de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected it, but now the men knew. It was too late to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to prevent it, for they had no weapons. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine did. It was preparing to drive man from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets, to rule there in his stead, with a population</seg><seg type="columnLine">of machines!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scientists quickly built a great space-flyer, a gigan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic machine of over ten miles diameter, a huge sphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in that they established laboratories, workshops,</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines, and living quarters. They took with them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finest men and women of their race, and sailed out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, taking an orbit about the sun of Sirius. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were comfortable there in an equitable temperature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ship lighted by the sun on one side, and dark on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, steadily revolving on its axis like a miniature</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. The foods of the people were chemically pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared, for the brain - machines had taught them how.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The air was repurified constantly by machines that regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated the percentage of the gases to the thousandth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one per cent. But the entire ship was painted black.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It could not be discovered floating there in space, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny in the vastness of a system!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was two weeks after they sailed that the machine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain attacked. It sailed out of its hiding place with</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of great ships, armed with Dis rays and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosives, with heat rays and attractor beams. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">population of those worlds was wiped out in a week,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rule of the Metal Horde began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The original brain built other brain machines to direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">its affairs on other planets, and to do the work it did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wish to do itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For nearly a century those men lived in space, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift forays on a planet with a fleet of cargo ships, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolved about the main ship like satellites when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not being used. In these trips they would bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">back tons of rock, and leave most of it stored in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships, dumping them into the reservoir of the parent</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship when it was needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a swift ship was developed. A ship that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE METAL HORDE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">start and stop more quickly than any made before--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship with acceleration neutralizers. But the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains of the Metal Horde never learned the secret.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a small fleet of these, the men drove an attack at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unprotected main brain machine. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">men known to live in the system. No other known</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine could move without the knowledge of that main</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, but these could. They too had the Dis ray now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they destroyed the main brain machine. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in the ensuing fight, but that machine was destroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the remaining machines were equally powerful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Any one of them could have built a brain machine that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could easily conquer the others--but it too would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bow to its creator. They fought it out. The men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known this would be the result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a war such as the system had never before seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each force was equal, and could not ally itself with any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, for the machines could not lie or state other than</seg><seg type="columnLine">their thoughts, and each wanted supreme power. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed new weapons, weapons whose strength lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their number. One by one the machine brains had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone down to defeat, the men of that ship helping to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturb the balance of forces by ever so little, yet always</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to throw one side down to defeat, yet always</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining in hiding. At last there remained but one</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine-brain, and its weakened force necessitated its</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to the devastated planet. With the destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other brain machines, the remaining machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had previously controlled, automatically obeyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new master as perfectly as they did the old.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They returned to find a new fleet awaiting them. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not a vast fleet such as they had encountered be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. At once the torpedo-ship machines settled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground and began turning out their weapons. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all over before they could enter as an important</seg><seg type="columnLine">factor. These ships had a new weapon. It was a ball of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing blue light that was driven along a beam of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration, and as it touched any ship, the ship instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">volatized so suddenly as to constitute an explosion. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">balls of light lasted about a minute and a half each, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">were replaced as quickly as they were used. When they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were finally used, they would die down to a dull red</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow, then suddenly wink out. They could be swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one ship to another, taking toll of ten or twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships each, and the beam that guided them could drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with the speed of light and supply an infinite ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celeration. They were glowing balls of concentrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy of some sort, and as such could travel with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they were effective to the nth degree. The entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet of that one remaining brain machine would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been lost, but it retired into space, racing away at top</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, out into space, with the remaining remnant of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">great fleet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And sixteen hundred years it had raced across space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be destroyed at last by another race of men. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle was over, and the machine awaited its destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We rayed it out of existence. It was too great a</seg><seg type="columnLine">menace to keep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Some people still do not believe that those Sirians</seg><seg type="columnLine">were truly machines. They can not believe that a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine can have intelligence, but certainly Waterson's cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culating machine has intelligence of a sort. And they</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask, what would a machine want to exist for ? It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no aim, nothing to perform. Why should it want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live, or exist?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We might ask what it is human beings want to live</seg><seg type="columnLine">for. If there is an after-life, it is certainly not that that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we live for. I am sure no man wants to die. Yet what</seg><seg type="columnLine">aim have we? What function must we perform? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should we wish to live? Our life is a constant struggle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machines, at least, had eliminated that. There seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me no reason why a machine should want to live, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly it has less reason to pass out of existence than</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That war was destructive--terribly so. But it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought its compensations. More than fifteen million</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings lost their lives in that great struggle, either</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the battles in space, or caught in the Dis rays during</seg><seg type="columnLine">that battle on Venus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But those fifteen millions have died a painless death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twenty billions live because of their sacrifice. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not a vain sacrifice. We have learned much in</seg><seg type="columnLine">return. No machines man ever made equaled the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines we captured there on Mars. And man will never</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment 011 the lines of the machine-brain. He has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been warned. The brain-machine we captured was de-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed without investigation. The machines we use,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wonderful worker machines, have been modified to</seg><seg type="columnLine">permit of radio control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And Stephen Waterson's discovery of the de-activat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing field not only helps in law enforcement, but makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">war with material energy impossible. No, in all, we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mars lost its cities, its forests, its ancient civilization.</seg><seg type="columnLine">New cities are being built on the modern plan, larger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">finer, more beautiful; the forests are being replaced; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the records, the relics of a civilization have been lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever. In that we have lost much. Though all move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able things were moved when the warning came, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was much that could not be moved. The great palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Horlak San was destroyed, but it is being rebuilt in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exact spot, in exactly the same manner. It is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth-while project, but there is much which cannot be</seg><seg type="columnLine">restored.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It will be eleven more years before we will know</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether we can ever communicate with the Sirian men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The speed of light is too low for rapid communication,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as the first signals were sent out in September, 1961,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it is now September, 1968, the signals are not due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach Sirius for two years more. Then it will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">1979 before we can hope to receive their reply. I often</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder if they will ever get those signals. I can remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber distinctly the recoil of the great projector as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty surges of light flashed out across the universe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed like some great gun--the back pressure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light was so great. And what will those replies tell us?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is interesting to speculate on that subject.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The End</seg><seg type="columnLine">emote</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Control</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By Walter Kateley</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">!Author of "The Fourteenth Earth," "Steam Heat" tic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">               Illustrated by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">               WESSO '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A MASSIVE steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">basket, much re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembling a greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enlarged freight</seg><seg type="columnLine">container of a gon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dola railway car, pulled up be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the dock.

To say he was an amateur in science is</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably doing him something of an injustice; for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully believe that even then he had a deeper insight into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the physical properties of all matter than any other man</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have ever been privileged to meet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had already perfected some experiments pertaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">to atomic densities, that were destined to have almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolutionary effects in the realm of physics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His was a personality such as made one instinctively</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel that he was in the presence of a great mind; and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">addition I had found him to be a most companionable and</seg><seg type="columnLine">genial spirit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I HAVE long been something of an amateur scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself; not that I have any great store of scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge, or have ever accomplished much of a scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific nature; but I have always been keenly interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unseen forces that rule the everyday world. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my interest in scientific matters has always far outrun</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ability to investigate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have a month's vacation every year, and I usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend the major portion of it rusticating on the old farm</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Minnesota where I was born. Here I have quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leisure for studying any phenomenon of Nature that</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the moment has enlisted my attention. For a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks I am a geologist, a zoologist, or perhaps an ento-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mologist; browsing among the secrets of nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old homestead has a small creek with a good fish</seg><seg type="columnLine">pond. The pond and the riffles are teeming in summer</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all manner of interesting aquatic life. Here too is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large gravel pit, replete with fossilized remains of pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">historic formations. And the old grove and fields abound</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a wealth of insect life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So with my hooks of reference, my microscope and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few other pieces of paraphernalia, I usually put in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">time enjoyably and not altogether unprofitably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the time of which I write, I was especially inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested in ants; their anatomy, building habits, social</seg><seg type="columnLine">customs and what not. I had even gone so far as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">establish a colony of the little creatures in a glassed-in</seg><seg type="columnLine">formicary in the library-living room of my town lodgings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I could have them under daily observation. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">year I was looking forward to my month at the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">homestead with pleasant anticipation, for I felt sure op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunities for ant study would be abundant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Shortly before vacation time, however, I received a let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter from Kingston; saying among other things that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to have a long vacation while his company were</seg><seg type="columnLine">remodelling and installing new machinery in some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings of the plant. I lost no time in inviting him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">join me at the old farm, where we could fish and rest, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">together chase our favorite phantoms and I mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my letter that I intended to give considerable time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He replied promptly, saying he would take great</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure in helping me catch my favorite ant; and asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">permission to bring with him a few articles of laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment, in order to carry out some experiments which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had in mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fortnight later we were sitting on the bank of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old fish pond in the bend of the creek; fishing for young</seg><seg type="columnLine">pickerel and scanning the water with a pair of short</seg><seg type="columnLine">range binoculars in quest of strange forms of aquatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. Behind us was the old gravel pit, where we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent a part of the morning examining some ancient sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">shells that evidently had been preserved in the sand since</seg><seg type="columnLine">pre-glacial times, when this particular area must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been submerged beneath salt water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How about your ants?" asked Kingston. "I hope you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not forgetting them in your zeal to entertain me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh, no," I replied. "I shall not forget them; in fact I</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought these glasses all the way from Washington for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the express purpose of studying the creatures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I plan to go up on the hill back of the sand pit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look for a formicary this afternoon.

You know Napoleon said, 'an army travels</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on its belly.' Or was it stomach? Well, anyway I be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lieve leading strategists are agreed that no one ought to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">risk an engagement with any of the tribes of Hymenop-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tera without a copious supply of lacteal fluid, rich in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">casein and lactic acid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So saying he took the thermos bottle from the basket</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and drank generously. He was a great buttermilk hound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And now, while he was on the farm where all dairy pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ducts were plentiful, he was making the most of his op-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">portunities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A valuable suggestion," I agreed. "No doubt the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">boys will be back from the creamery when we go down to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the house for lunch, and we will load the old demijohn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a fresh, cool supply."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  AND so that afternoon we took our basket, loaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">JL\ with the glasses, a few smaller instruments, a bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cedar oil for the oil-immersion lens, together with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kingston's beloved buttermilk bottle, and hopefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed the little hill that flanked the gravel-pit. Here, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had expected, we found a couple of very populous</seg><seg type="columnLine">formicaries, and chose one close to the shade of a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">maple tree for our investigations. This nest seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">very nearly, if not quite, on the spot where I had known</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to be fully twenty years before, when I was a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I am inclined to believe that the colony had occupied</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the same quarters for at least two decades, and possibly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much longer. The mound was about two feet in diam-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eter and perhaps ten or twelve inches high. It was made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up largely of small twigs and straws, pebbles, etc. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ants were quite large, with red thorax and dark, almost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">black, abdomen. The female or working ants varied</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quite extensively as to size and strength of mandibles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We identified the tenants of this domain as belonging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the group Lasiiis Niger, variety Americanus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Upon examination we found the workers busy at their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">multifarious occupations. They were carrying in frag-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ments of insects and other articles of food; bringing out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rubbish and carrying their little aphids--ants' cows--to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and from the pasture grounds. The nurse ants were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bringing their charges, the grubs and Iarvse, out for an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">afternoon airing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In fact all was orderly commotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  While we watched, a group of workers appeared at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">edge of the mound, bringing in a twig several inches</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long. There were more than a dozen of them at this job,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and their performance revealed perfect teamwork.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We were anxious to see something of the substructure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the formicary, so we decided to start an excavation,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by digging a hole some five feet deep, at a distance of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">several feet from the mound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This we lengthened in the direction of the ants' habi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tation, in order to reveal a vertical section of the works</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">without too greatly disturbing the inhabitants or injuring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their home. As we approached the vicinity of the sub-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">structure, carefully shaving the soil away in vertical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slices, we came upon the quarters of a colony of minute</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">red ants, whom we at once recognized as robbers. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little creatures were no doubt preying on their much</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">larger neighbors, and living largely off stolen food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We soon found that the rooms and galleries of the red</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ants were connected by tiny tunnels with those of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">larger formicary, and that these tunnels were too small</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the larger ants to enter through. Such an arrange-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment rendered it possible for the little marauders to slip</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into their victims' quarters and snatch anything small</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enough to carry away and duck back to safety with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At length we came upon the rooms and galleries of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">large ants, and found them busy with their household</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">duties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Some were taking care of the eggs and young.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have a somewhat different theory; although as yet it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a theory. My conception is that a single ant is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">an entire individual. In other words, these units that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">see are not the entire entity, but only parts of a larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal, other parts of which escape our notice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"■pERHAPS I can explain by using the following il-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  1 lustration.

If one line should turn, the other would turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">also. There would appear to be perfect cooperation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">teamwork.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because we could see no connection between them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we might suppose that each was a complete animal, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that each was intelligent and highly efficient as a marcher;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we would naturally wonder how the general move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of the whole group were directed. Or, to put it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another light. Suppose there were a race of beings so</seg><seg type="columnLine">constituted that they could not see our bodies, but only</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "They would be interested in watching our hands do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all manner of things; writing, using tools, operating</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines and so on. They would naturally suppose that</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hands were possessed of intelligence; yet upon ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amination, no brain could be found. Then suppose we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a dozen hands; a hundred; or even as many as an ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill has ants. All these hands might be at work with</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming intelligence, and no particular hand would ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear to be directing the others as to what to do, or how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Of course I know you might find objections to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">analogy, as applied to the ants. You may say that each</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant has its own organs, such as digestive apparatus, sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smell. And I might answer: so does every part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an amaba have its own organs, or rather the functions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of organs. Each part digests the food with which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes in contact. The parts move and react to stimuli,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although there is no brain and no nerves or sense organs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we know them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then again, our own hands have certain sense or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gans, such as the sense of touch, sensitiveness to heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cold, etc. I see no reason, therefore, why Nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not add other senses, such as sight and taste; in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, all the senses we know and others that we know not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So perhaps these ants that we see are only a great many</seg><seg type="columnLine">operating parts of one animal.

There may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves, or substitutes for nerves, right before your eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing from each ant to some central location; but you</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot see them. Let us consider a nerve. It is a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">string of white, fatty substance, extending from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain as a ganglion to some portion of the body. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">a message passes along this substance, we do not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is really happening. Apparently there is no move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the nerve substance, and no change in its compo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition. So we are led to believe that the nerve itself has</seg><seg type="columnLine">no intelligence nor mechanical energy; and that it only</seg><seg type="columnLine">acts as a passive medium on which the message travels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE do not know what a nerve message really is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To our senses it has no tangible form or sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance; but our reason dictates that it is a movement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some kind of energy, perhaps a series of vibrations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort; possibly akin to light, heat or electricity. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human brain, knowing far more than we know, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to interpret these vibrations in terms of sight, smell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch, etc. Or, if the vibrations originate in the brain,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">some organs in the muscles--organs which we have yet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover--have power to translate them in terms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion.

Another ant moved into the clouded area;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and immediately I discovered that she also was ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">companied by a similar fragment of color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  By this time my curiosity was thoroughly aroused. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">focused on other ants, and found them all accompanied</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the same phenomenon. And to my ever-increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise, I found that in some cases this line of brilliance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very long. In one instance, where a small worker</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mounted on a twig, the strange glimmer was fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">two inches long. It was like a ray of some peculiar kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I now noted that from all the workers within my ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servation the color line extended in approximately the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same direction; that is, toward the center of the formi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cary, regardless of which way the ant was facing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As I was puzzling over this, Kingston's voice broke in</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my consciousness. He had noticed how intent I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the spectacle, and had no doubt detected a look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment on my face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What is it?" he said. "Are you seeing a ghost?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I hardly know what it is," I replied in my bewilder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I handed him the glasses. "Look at the ants through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clouded spot in the right lens," I directed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He held the glasses to his eyes. I watched him with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">interest.	.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For a moment the binoculars were stationary. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that he was moving his line of vision from place</seg><seg type="columnLine">to place. Evidently he was transferring his attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">from ant to ant, just as I had done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What do you make of it, Watson?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He did not answer. Very soon he focused the glasses</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the opposite side of the ant-hill for a few moments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he picked up a twig from the top of the mound and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held it before him. He noted that several of the inhabi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tants clung to the twig. At length he lowered the glasses</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned on me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What can it be?" I said, hoping that he might have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">some explanation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He stared at me as if unable to comprehend my ques-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.	. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Why, my God, man, what do you suppose it is? he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked as if entirely out of patience with my density.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What were you just talking about?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then with an abrupt change of manner, he ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tended his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear fellow," he said, "I want to congratulate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you on having made the greatest discovery in zoology of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the twentieth century! It is, beyond question, the nerve</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">system of the ant colony!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why," I said incredulously, "has no one ever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seen it before?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My companion was examining the spot on the lens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I suppose," he replied, "that no naturalist has ever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">before had the good fortune to spill just the exactly cor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rect mixture of cedar oil and buttermilk on his lens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We must preserve this dried film with the utmost care."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AGAIN we took up the examination. We found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">worker several feet from the mound, and had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble in discovering the bright line and tracing it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her all the way to the side of the ant hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then we thrust the point of the spade into the formi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cary, and took up a mass of the building material covered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and filled with ants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holding this above the mound and focusing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses on a point below it, we beheld innumerable lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brilliance extending to the formicary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It resembled a wonderfully illuminated waterfall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I have no doubt that the queen ant is' the center of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this marvelous system," I announced. "We ought to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">continue our excavations until we find her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It might be quite a long job," said my friend. "The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sun is getting low, and that bank of clouds will soon ob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scure it. So maybe we had better wait until morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I am afraid to put it off," I replied with some im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">patience, "because it may be that, when this film on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glasses dries a little more, it will lose this marvelous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quality. And then we might never know the origin of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the lines. We might never be able to hit upon just the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">right combination."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, you may be right about that," he admitted; "and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in that case we had better go on as far as we can tonight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">So I hastily started digging again; shaving the vertical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">layers of the formicary, stopping every now and then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">while Kingston examined the direction of the lines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But very soon the sun's rays commenced to lose their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brilliance; the lines became increasingly hard to detect</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and follow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we decided to call it a day and go home. That</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">evening we determined to treat some panes of glass with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cedar oil and buttermilk, to see if by any chance they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would give the same effect as the lens. We cleaned a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dozen or more photographic dry-plates, and covered them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a thin film of cedar oil and buttermilk mixed in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">varying proportions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  These we set aside to dry. Then we treated the other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lens of the binoculars with a mixture that we hoped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be effective.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The next day proved to be rainy; but during the day</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there occurred several short periods of sunshine between</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">showers. We took advantage of these short periods to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">test our treated glasses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We soon found that none of the plates gave any re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sults. Neither did the newly covered lens; but we were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gratified to find that the original clouded one still re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tained its magic quality. It was evident that we had not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hit upon the proper proportion of oil and buttermilk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The lens seemed to be too opaque. This was presumably</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">due to too great a proportion of buttermilk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">REMOTE CONTROL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We hastily prepared a more attenuated mixture, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced the old coating. During a later period of sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine, we found that this new film gave perceptible re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults, but was far from satisfactory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After several trials, with varying proportions, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally arrived at one containing only a trace of butter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">milk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time the sun was so low that we had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">further opportunity to test our work, and so were</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliged to postpone further experiment until the follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately the morning was clear and light. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at the formicary bright and early. To our great</seg><seg type="columnLine">delight we found that our newly treated lens was a suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess. In fact it was quite as clear as the old one, and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course afforded a much larger field of vision, so that now</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were able to observe a large group of ants at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. When a large number were lifted from the formi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cary en masse, it gave a very beautiful effect. The bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant lines were so close together that in some cases the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye could not separate them; but they never seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By manipulating several groups in the air at one time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we provided some very striking effects. We were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">entranced with the brilliance and beauty of the spectacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was only with the greatest reluctance that we at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length forced ourselves to go to work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We now continued our excavation; one watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the lines from near by ants, while the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed the soil and deposits of the formicary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon arriving at a point near the center of the mound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and two or three inches above the surrounding surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil, we came upon a locality where all lines seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">converge. But to our surprise there was no queen ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">present. In fact there seemed to be only a deposit of ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">eggs in an exceptionally large cell. Using the low power</seg><seg type="columnLine">lens of the microscope, we discovered that there was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed a very minute basket-like arrangement, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed of silken fibre such as that from which the ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">grubs spin their cocoons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Switching to the 444 lens, we were able to make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the little container was filled with an almost trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent liquid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALTHOUGH we investigated carefully, we could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing further, and upon segregating the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">basket-like object and moving it about, we discovered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the convergence of the bright lines moved with it, follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it from place to place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently there was nothing to do but try the oil im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mersion lens. Yet we hesitated, because we feared that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oil to be used might prove fatal to the animal matter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in case there really was a living creature present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After some discussion, we decided to carry on. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought a large flat stone, on which we carefully mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">our microscope and an auxiliary light condenser. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the tiny basket mounted on a crystal slide, we com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced our examination. I knew that Kingston was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very accomplished microscopist, and I permitted him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take charge of the work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some time his efforts were unsuccessful. But at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length he announced. "I believe I have it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later he affirmed emphatically. "Yes, here</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is, sure enough. And it's alive," he added presently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Needless to say I was all agog, and impatient to have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">look; and my companion soon gave his place to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately there appeared before my vision a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute but quite distinct object. It resembled an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly formed brain. It was palpitating slightly; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I gazed spellbound, it moved perceptibly with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">amoeba-like motion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently it was suspended somewhat below the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the crystal-clear liquid in which it was immersed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Undoubtedly that is the brain and nerve center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole colony," declared Kingston. "I have no doubt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is hatched from a special kind of egg; and that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">draws its nourishment from this bath in which it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">immersed, after the manner of an amoeba."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably the ants deposit predigested food substances</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bath. There regurgitated foods may be prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and concentrated in the digestive tracts of especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">adapted workers. Or it may be that the queen herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">performs this as a royal duty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I doubt very much if it comes from an egg," went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kingston. "I think it is more likely in the nature of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">amoeba. That is to say, its method of reproduction is by</seg><seg type="columnLine">division, and like an amoeba, its life is eternal, except in</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of destruction from outward sources. Perhaps after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a subdivision of the organism the superfluous brain is</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried away by a young queen, about to institute another</seg><seg type="columnLine">colony; in the same manner as a young queen often flies</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with a number of small wingless workers, or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragment of fungus culture with which to start a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">establishment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be that as it may," I replied, "I think we can safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that this is the animal itself, possessed of brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">power and intelligence; and that what we call ants are</seg><seg type="columnLine">only its multitudinous appendages; the queen being in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reality only its reproductive organ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The various parts of its anatomy are not connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">one with another by organic tissues. But they arc con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected and coordinated into one complete entity by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous and beautiful system of nerves; this network</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lines of force."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is indeed a great discovery," said Kingston im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressively. "And I foresee that it is sure to have far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching results."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a moment he went on. "If we could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover what this nerve energy is, and determine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave length of its vibrations, we could apply the force to</seg><seg type="columnLine">all animals. We could revolutionize all industry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I will not dwell on the account of our further investiga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. Suffice it to say that we returned to our respective</seg><seg type="columnLine">employments after vacation; and I spent my spare time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparing a report to submit to the entomological society.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I prepared it with much care and elaboration; for I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced that it would create a furor when it came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the notice of the scientific world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MEANWHILE, as his letters revealed, my colleague</seg><seg type="columnLine">was busy in his little home laboratory, trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">analyze this peculiar nerve force that could travel through</seg><seg type="columnLine">space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  One day I received a letter full of jubilation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I find," he wrote, "that it is not far different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">light; its wave length is not a great deal shorter than</seg><seg type="columnLine">those at the violet end of the spectrum."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went on to say that he was trying to produce an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus that would generate this force. He also sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested that we give a name to this new found entity, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to distinguish it from light, electricity, etc., and</seg><seg type="columnLine">aptly suggested the name "Formicidary Rays."</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'A still later letter adyised me that he had succeeded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">producing a generator that was something like a cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">between a dry battery and an X-ray machine, and that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now able to produce visible lines of formicidary rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">at will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I asked for a few days' leave of absence and took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried trip to his home, where I found him hard at work</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have asked the company for three months off," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained, "and they have retaliated by electing me to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">position of third vice-president.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only difference between the ants and the others is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ants have a specialized sending apparatus--broadcast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mechanism if you will--that causes the message to</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel on nerves where there are nerve fibres, and in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">6pace where the nerves are lacking; whereas the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">are possessed of an apparatus that sends over nerve</seg><seg type="columnLine">fibres only.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now if we can find a way to convey messages to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve centers and ganglia of an animal in such a way that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will come in stronger than those from the animals'</seg><seg type="columnLine">own brain, we can control the actions of the animals'</seg><seg type="columnLine">body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose a dog is standing with one foot raised off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground.

Hie was a free</seg><seg type="columnLine">spender, seemed to have plenty of money, and being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">genial soul, always ready to buy a pint for anyone ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pass an hour with him, he was accepted at his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">value and was generally liked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a big man, well over six feet and weighing</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of fifteen stone (two hundred and ten pounds);</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad and thick, with a trick of standing with legs wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread and head cocked to one side--"Like a bloomin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailor," as Johnny Handy put it. His face was tanned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nose sharp and crooked a bit to one side, and he wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short crisp beard, that, like his thick, tousled hair, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming red, streaked a bit with gray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Abner Spree claimed to be over one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">years old and had been to sea as a young man. He said</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it had been seventy-five years ago he'd have sworn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Ben was a bloody pirate, and he got very reminis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent and spent the whole evening telling stories of days</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he was at sea and the adventures he'd had. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">one doubted that Big Ben had been a sailor, but no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked him, for good-natured as he was and liked as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was by all, still there was that about him that made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">body hesitate to pry into his affairs or ask personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he was a man of very regular habits. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning he was up before sun-up, and carrying a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick that was near to being a club, and dressed in Harris</seg><seg type="columnLine">tweeds, he'd go for a long walk through the fields and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinneys. Many's the time I've met him as I was driv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to Guildford or to Kingston, striding along as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he were walking on a wager, whistling or puffing furi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously at his big black pipe. Or I'd see him sitting on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stile or a rock maybe, watching a flock of rooks or gaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up at a singing lark, or maybe as intent on studying</seg><seg type="columnLine">some bug or tree as one of the scientific chaps from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kensington.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Regular as a clock, too, he'd be off to London, start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing by the first motor-coach in the morning and getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in the evening, and always with a black leather bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand. What he did in London nobody knew, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">we all thought likely 'twas to his bank he went, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Blaber's Inn" had always had a good trade, betwixt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the folks round about and the tourists forever passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth on the Portsmouth Road, or stopping off</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the old houses and the church and what not at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street Hobham. And since Big Ben had owned the Inn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the business had picked up most amazingly. He had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">beer and ale cold--that pleased the American tourists</seg><seg type="columnLine">immensely--and there wasn't a pub 'twixt Portsmouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and London could old a candle to the Blue Lion for</seg><seg type="columnLine">food. Moreover, Big Ben had fixed up the old place</seg><seg type="columnLine">till 'twas like a museum to see, what with heads of foxes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and red deer and stags, and stuffed pheasants and birds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and big pike and salmon on panels on the walls, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rusty old guns and swords and what not, together with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly idols from Lord knows where, and curios from</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreign parts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A great hand he was for collecting this, that and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, buying old junk in the way of chairs and tables</seg><seg type="columnLine">and settees and old pewter and china. And there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his parrot in its cage, a fine green bird big as a pigeon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though whatsoever he wanted her for I don't know, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">she never talked, but croaked and whistled a bit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed fit to deafen one. But the place was cozy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Big Ben had the neatest bit of a barmaid that eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see--a pert, bright-eyed, laughing lass with hair as</seg><seg type="columnLine">red as is own, but a right proper girl at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, taken altogether, the place did a right roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade and the silver came in fast and Big Ben had every</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to go to London to bank his savings every week.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still 'twas queer, as we often remarked, that when-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever strangers were about and the tap-room and bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parlour were crowded, Big Ben never was about. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sitting alone or with a crony or two in the little back</seg><seg type="columnLine">room with a mug of mulled ale or maybe arf an' arf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his big black pipe, and most often with his coat off</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his shirt open showing his hairy chest with a bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue tattoo on it. He'd be as chummy as is, but never</seg><seg type="columnLine">did I know him to tell a word of his past, or a tale of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea, or of the foreign parts he must have been to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now and again some one of us would try a bit to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out, mentioning this, that or the other thing quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually, or maybe speaking of something we'd read in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the press about some foreign place or even getting old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Spree to start in on his everlasting stories we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a thousand times and more. But it wasn't any</seg><seg type="columnLine">use. Big Ben'd nod his head, or maybe roar with laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter till the mugs rattled, and swear 'twas marvelous or</seg><seg type="columnLine">past belief, but never a yes nor a no nor a when I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this, that or the other place. I mind one day that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Dickey asked him about that parrot of his. Asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Big Ben kept her for, as she didn't say so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as "Damn," and then asked where he got her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Them as talks least says the most sense," said Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben, cocking his ead one side and peering at te bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">with eyes half shut. "And she's a wery remarkable Poll</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that," he goes on. "In fact," he says, "the most re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable parrot in the world, I might say. Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye can't see it," he says, "neither can a lad see anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">so remarkable in another lad's sweetheart, though he'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">think there be none like her on earth. 'Tis the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her"--jerking his thumb towards the cage hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEATHERED DETECTIVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the window. But he never answered Tom's question</seg><seg type="columnLine">about where he got hold of the bird, I noticed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT he must have told the truth about her being so</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable, for one day a party from America was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopping in at the Blue Lion, and having their ale and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitters and what not, as they waited for luncheon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them--a nervous, thin old fellow in knickers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with goggles, jumps up and goes over to the bird hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the sun. "My goodness 1" he exclaims, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the bar having a drink and a chat with Bess, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard him. "My goodness gracious 1" he says a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. "Where on earth did these people get hold of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird! Why, as true as I live it's a touraco. A most</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable specimen and the only one I've ever seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in confinement."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the ladies laughed. "Why, Professor," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "it seems just a common green parrot to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What's so remarkable about the creature?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old fellow snorted. "And those worm-eaten old</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs you raved over this morning looked just like</seg><seg type="columnLine">any ordinary old chairs to me," he told her back. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so remarkable about them, I'd like to know ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, why, they were old--they were antiques, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">very, very rare," she says.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly," snaps the one she'd called "Professor."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, this bird is not old and he is not antique, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's very, very, and then again very, rare, if you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know. In fact, it is quite the most remarkable bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have ever seen and well worth my visit to England."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, do let's buy the precious thing, then," says an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other lady. "I'm having my boudoir all finished in just</seg><seg type="columnLine">that delightful shade of green and the dear bird will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in perfect harmony."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I expect Big Ben must have been listening also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or maybe the waitress or someone told him, for just</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Jimmy the porter comes in and takes the bird, cage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all, and starts to go out. But the Professor stops</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you inquire of the owner of the bird if he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispose of it, and for how much?" he says to Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Jimmy comes back and tells the Professor that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the owner doesn't care to part with the parrot, at which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lady with the green boudoir laughs and says she has</seg><seg type="columnLine">never yet found anything that money won't buy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">will five hundred pounds make the bird's owner change</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind. Jimmy's eyes fairly popped out of his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">at tliat, and I came near to spilling my bitters and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed at Bess for support. I was that put out about</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing the lady offering five hundred quid for a green</seg><seg type="columnLine">parrot that I didn't even talk. "Mind where you're put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting your hand," snaps Bess, giving me a smart slap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But my Gawd, she said that as easy as I'd say six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pence !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when Jimmy comes back and says as how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner--meaning Big Ben, of course--wouldn't sell, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">for five hundred nor for five thousand pounds, Bess</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed me, and I didn't ask her to mind where her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands were nor slap her, you may be sure, and for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of that neither of us noticed; we were that</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed to think Big Ben put so much store by his par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rot that couldn't say boo. Well, the upshot of it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Big Ben's green parrot became right famous--what</seg><seg type="columnLine">with everyone talking about his having refused five hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred pounds for the bird--and everyone would drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Blue Lion just to have a look at the bird, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of course they'd have their drinks, and as I told Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ryder, and the others agreed, Big Ben wasn't such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool as we'd thought to refuse the American lady's</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer, because he was making more out of the bird being</seg><seg type="columnLine">so famous than he'd have got from her--that is if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parrot didn't die on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But of course there was a bit of gossip going about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. A man who could refuse five hundred quid--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">five thousand, he said--as easy as is, must be rich, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even with all that he was making at the Blue Lion it</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to get about that Big Ben had a tidy bit of gold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course it was nobody's business. He had as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to money as the next, and for all anyone knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might have got it in the gold fields somewhere, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">by honest work or saving or any other way. But there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no place like a village for gossip, as you know, and folks</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to recollect how he came to Hobham, how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid for the inn with gold pieces and that they really</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know anything about the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, I'd known him ever since he'd come and I hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed anything strange nor mysterious about him--ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept maybe his not wishing to be about among strangers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which wasn't mysterious, but just natural, seeing how</seg><seg type="columnLine">he preferred going about without his coat and collar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was never one to dress up. But others said his</seg><seg type="columnLine">trips to London were suspicious, though Lord knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">why, and that he might have been a robber or a bandit</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a gambler or some sort of a scoundrel before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to Hobham, and why didn't he have friends or</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever get letters? And when the maid at the Blue Lion</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Mrs. Gregg that she never in all the time Ben had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been there had seen his big portmanteau open, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it always was kept locked, and said he always kept a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded pistol in his room, everyone began to say Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a past and kept some secret locked up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">portmanteau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were some of us laughed at this talk--I did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sam Ryder and two or three others who knew Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben pretty well--that is, as well as anyone in the vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage knew him. But old Andy Prout and doddering old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Spree shook their heads and said they wouldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit surprised if Big Ben had been a pirate or some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing worse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was about this time that a stranger came to Bren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's Heath and put up at the Old Bear there. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to the Heath the day he came and at first sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gasped like a fish out of water, for back-to as I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him when he got off the bus, he was so like Big Ben</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought 'twas he himself, though I knew he was over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Blue Lion at the same time. Yes, sir, the stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the same build as Big Ben--broad as an ox, tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he even had the red hair. But he was a younger</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. I could see as he turned about, there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray in his hair and no beard. But the same sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose and tanned like he'd been long at sea or in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot land, and with a big ugly white scar running across</seg><seg type="columnLine">one cheek and making his mouth turn up at the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">side as if he was ever grinning on one side of his mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He walked like a sailor, too; legs spread, but didn't cock</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head aside like Big Ben. I don't know a6 I can quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it clear, but somehow I got the idea that while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Ben was a good-natured, easy-going, good-hearted</seg><seg type="columnLine">chap, even if a bit rough in his ways, this fellow at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Bear was a nasty dispositioned, surly sort, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">as wouldn't stand for any humbugging or nonsense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still, he spoke fair enough as he tipped the porter for</seg><seg type="columnLine">34</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying in his bag, a black portmanteau as like Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben's as two peas in a pod. Yes, aside from the beard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he being a younger man, I'd have said he and Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben might have been twin brothers. But there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing; this man didn't bring a parrot with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, I had it in mind to mention him to Big Ben,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I got back to Hobham; thought he'd be interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">in knowing there was a stranger so like him over at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Bear. But what with one thing and another I clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot it, and I didn't think of the stranger again till</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next day, when Big Ben being off to London and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I dropping in to have a mug of ale and a word with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bess, who should come into the Blue Lion but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger from over to the Old Bear. I didn't like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he leered and winked at Bess, who was a right</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper lass, as I've said, and not one to be free with,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he spoke civilly enough, and ordering a "gin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">It" sat himself down on a settle and lit his pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe," says he after a bit, "you may know if there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a party hereabouts by the name of Tom Henley."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at Bess and Bess looked at me and we both</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook our heads. "No," I told him. "Man and boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've lived here or hereabouts all my life, and I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">every man, woman and child in this corner of Surrey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there's only two Henleys I know of. One's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">widow Henley over to West Clacton, and her man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed in the war and his name was John, not Tom;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other's Bill Henley, the constable at Esher."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fellow dropped the lid to his left eye and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me like I had two heads or maybe a tail or some'at</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sort. "Pimm," says he. "And maybe the lad</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm asking about's not known as such hereabouts. May-</seg><seg type="columnLine">be he's hoisted false colors, so to say, and's a sailin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">under another name. Maybe if I told you what sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was you'd know of him. A big man he is, nigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same size as me, with red hair and a bit gray and</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely a whisker on his face, but no scar to twist his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mug to one side like I carries. Maybe for a crown you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can recall such a lad as bein' seen hereabouts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW I can't say to this minute why I didn't tell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chap he was describing Big Ben to a T, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know likewise why Bess kept a still tongue in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. But the stranger had asked for Big Ben under</seg><seg type="columnLine">another name, and if Big Ben wanted to be Ben Pollard</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of Tom Henley, it was likely he had reasons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">'twas no business of mine to be telling this stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the man he was asking for and Big Ben were one</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I expect Bess felt the same, because we felt Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben was a decent chap, no matter if he wasn't Big Ben</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pollard at that, while this chap, sitting there and asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">us questions, wasn't the kind of a lad we'd coddle to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you don't know such a lad, then?" says the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger, drinking the last of his "gin and It." "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's damn queer," he goes on, half-talking to himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They told me over to the Old Bear as how I'd find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad I'm lookin' for over to the Blue Lion here. Said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ran the place, they did. Now what's the game, me</seg><seg type="columnLine">lass, and you, me lad, tryin' to stall me off by sayin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's no such man in these parts? Who's the owner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this pub, I'm askin' you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I'm a quiet lad as a rule, but I've got my temper at</seg><seg type="columnLine">times and the tone and the words of this fellow with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crooked mouth didn't suit me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look you here," says I, a bit hotly, I expect. "Who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you arc or what your business is, I don't know and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't care a damn. You're a stranger here and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come prying into other folks' affairs and sitting there</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking questions like you were in a bally police court</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you the magistrate. If you want information, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blazes don't you go to the police and ask them ? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you want to know who the owner of this pub is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">come round this evening and ask Big Ben himself. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">put that in your pipe and smoke it, laddy me lad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fellow grinned and stood up. "No offense in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended," says he. "But how, may I ask you, did Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben, as you call him, buy this tidy bit of a place? With</seg><seg type="columnLine">good gold, I'll warrant. And where do you suppose lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">got gold, me lad, with no gold knocking about oP Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land since the war? In some foreign port, o*"course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And how do you know how he got it? Maybe by hook</seg><seg type="columnLine">or by crook, maybe by honest work, and maybe by shed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">din' a bit of some other lad's blood an' helpin' of him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to what he wanted. Have you thought o' that, me</seg><seg type="columnLine">lass and me lad ? Have ye thought that maybe Big Ben,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you call him, is a bloody murderer and wanted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police? And maybe there's a tidy bit of a reward for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as you two might be dividin' for to start house-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keepin' with, and maybe that's why he's Big Ben and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Henley no more. So-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he got no further. Bess was a quick-tempered</seg><seg type="columnLine">lass, and she turned as red as her hair, and, picking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">an empty stout bottle, she shied it at the fellow's head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was a good shot, Bess was, and the stranger ducked</seg><seg type="columnLine">just in time. And not quite in time at that, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle struck him fair and square in the shoulder. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">spat out an oath and started for us, but just then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opens and in comes Sam Phillips, the postman, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy Hart, and, with a glare and a mumbled curse, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow goes out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who's the big lad ?" asks Sam, as he and Billy come</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to the bar. "He's as like Big Ben as is, savin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scar on his face and lackin' the gray in his hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the beard to his cheeks and chin. A stranger, I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinkin'!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye," says I, "and no welcome one at that, to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of thinking. He's stopping over to the Old Bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Brenton's Heath."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, we thought no more of the fellow at that, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">till evening when Big Ben come home and Billy Hart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was a gossiping sort, tells Big Ben as how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very spit of himself was into the Blue Lion this day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I noticed Big Ben gave a start and his knuckles turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">white where his hands rested on the table edge, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke calm and steady enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "So," he says; "I'd like to see the lad as looks like me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What sort of a chap was he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, Billy goes on to describe him, and Big Ben</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns to Bess. "What was he doin' here ?" he asks her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did he say where he was stoppin'?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She told him the lad was asking for a man named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Henley, and said he was stopping at the Old Bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Brenton'6 Heath. I was watching Big Ben close,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for in my ears were the stranger's words about murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a reward, much as I tried to forget them, and I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Big Ben for all his calmness and his easy tones</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mightily disturbed by the news. But he was not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to give himself away, not he. "Hmm," says he;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tom Henley, eh? Never heard of him, I haven't, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I've not been here over long. Do any of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">lads know of' the man ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEATHERED DETECTIVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cool customer he was, no less, and even if he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that the other lad had hinted, I couldn't feel a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like for Big Ben. And maybe, I thought, the other had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said what he had just to draw Bess and me out, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be nothing to it. Like as not, I thought, 'twas a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blackmail he was trying, for he looked the sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounder to be that dirty, and maybe he did know some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">.thing of Big Ben's past that he could threaten to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless he was well paid to keep quiet. But what if Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben did have a bit of a shady past at that, I thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Didn't we all have things we'd like to forget and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot? I'm no angel myself, I'm not, and anyhow, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Ben had done anything much 'twas the business of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police and of nobody else. And as for having gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">to buy the Blue Lion with, well, I hadn't thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that before, 'tis true, and I doubt if the others had, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see we all knew he was a stranger, and coming up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Portsmouth coach we'd taken it for granted he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">come over seas--what with his big coat and his bag and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his parrot and all, and his sailorish ways--and so why</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldn't he have had good gold sovereigns? Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd come from America or maybe from some other</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot where gold was plenty, and couldn't a man have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few hundred pounds of money in his pockets without</seg><seg type="columnLine">being a murderer or a thief or a rascal of some sort?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howsoever, liking Big Ben as I did, and knowing him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as the next, me being so much about and drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping in to the Blue Lion and chatting with Bess and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what not, I decided 'twould do no harm to tell Big Ben</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit more of the other chap's words, so if there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything to it all, Big Ben'd be on his guard. So I man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to get him one side and told him everything. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened mightily intent and his facc serious and then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst into a hearty laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks, Bob, thankee kindly," he says, clapping me</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the back. " 'Tis not many as would be as free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken as you, but I know 'tis because you think I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should know, and I know you don't believe a blinkin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of it. But I know the lad over to the Old Bear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do, and I know his game and what he's after, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can look after myself, I can. So don't worry over me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob, me lad, but thanks for what you've told me/'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WELL, sir, that was that, and me not knowing any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than before, except that Big Ben knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other and his game, and the matter wasn't any business</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mine after that. But just the same when Nate</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bronson said he'd seen a hulking big man muffled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a cloak hanging about the Blue Lion after one in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning--though what Nate was doing up at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour the Lord alone knows (poaching, I expect)--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to feel that there was something afoot and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stranger from the Old Bear wasn't there for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">good and peaceful reasons. In fact I had a mind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell Big Ben about the fellow sneaking about in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the night, but remembered he'd said he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">take care of himself, so I didn't mention it. In fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bess said I'd best not, and she said, too, that 'twas a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of funny thing that ever since the other man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been there, Big Ben had kept his parrot in his bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, instead of in the bar-parlour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe," I said, "it hasn't anything to do with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow, or again perhaps he's a rascal and a thief and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Ben thinks he may try to steal the bird. If it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth five hundred quid, as the American seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, it's well worth lifting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And another thing," says Bess. "Carrie" (that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the maid at the inn) "tells me he keeps his pistols all</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded and under his pillow now," says Bess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "So I'd do the same," says I, "if that scar-faced scoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drel had been asking about me and hinting at a past I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't want dug up and-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then he does know him and he's really and truly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Henley!" exclaimed Bess. "Golly, I wonder what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's done that there's a reward for him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, of course I'd made a slip, but by now Bess</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I understood each other pretty well, and I told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole thing and warned her to keep it to herself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I don't believe a thing about that reward," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If the lad over to the Heath knows anything about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Ben's past, he's just a rat of a blackmailer. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think he wouldn't want to grab that reward if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one? And I shouldn't be a bit surprised if he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one the police want, not Big Ben."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, the next morning I was off early for Kingston,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as I drove along past Fairmile, who should I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking along the road ahead of me but Big Ben and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stranger from the Heath. You could have knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">me over with a feather, for they looked as friendly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, talking earnest but no high words nor excitement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now and then laughing. I was that dumfounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stopped the car and sat there, just looking at them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they turned into the lane and disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that night, as I was coming back late, it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">different story. I was pretty near to Hobham, coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">in by way of Oxshott, and was passing the bit of spinney</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Ockam Dean, when I heard loud voices and a curse</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two from behind the hedge. Of course I didh't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop-- it wasn't any of my affair and it don't pay to</seg><seg type="columnLine">interfere in other folks' quarrels--but I could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">sworn before any judge and jury that the voices, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them, was that of Big Ben and the other that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lad with the scar on his face. And sure enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I dropped into the Blue Lion, Bess told me Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben was out, and hadn't been in since he'd gone off</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his stick along about dark. Well, I hung around</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit, worried for fear there might have been trouble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you see I'd never heard Big Ben angry or cursing</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, and I knew he had that whacking heavy stick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when a big quiet man gets mad, he gets mad all</seg><seg type="columnLine">through and goes crazy like and sees red and doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop to think what he is doing. And I knew if he hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with that stick, he'd just about bash in the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other chap. Not that I'd have minded if he had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only I knew the police would get him if he did and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there'd be the devil to pay all around, what with none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us really knowing anything about Big Ben, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gossip there'd been about him and one thing and another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I needn't have worried. Along about ten Big Ben</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in, looking a bit flustered and red in the face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twirling his stick, but otherwise the same as usual. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">drank a lot that night, he did, that is for him, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually was a most moderate drinker, and he smoked</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady and wasn't so talkative as usual. And around</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten-thirty sharp he got up and shooed us all out, saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">as how he was tired and was going to bed and didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to be disturbed and was going to close up for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the last any of us ever saw of Big Ben</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First thing next morning Carrie came screaming out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Blue Lion--she was the first one to be up, bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">36</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ring Big Ben--and yelling that Big Ben was dead. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course everyone in the village--leastwise all who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and dressed and a lot who weren't, that is weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed, I mean, came on the run after Constable Haley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bess was standing in the bar-parlour, wrapped up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of a silk thing and all a-tremble and scared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but looking mighty pretty, I thought, and Jimmy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boots was shaking and scared like the others. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carrie, between gasps and starts, told how she'd gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Big Ben's room to take him his tea, and had knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the door, and no answer coming had peeped in, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was Big Ben sprawled on the floor with his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">all twisted to one side and dead as you please.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Murder it is, sir!" wailed Carrie, who was old and</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitable anyhow. "Oh, Lord, ha' mercy on me; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can see his eyes now, sir. All glazed and glassy like,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' rolled up and his face as purple as a pansy, sir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord ha' mercy! The poor master murdered in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">pub! And such a fine, generous, good-hearted gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man he was at that, sir! And now-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT nobody paid any heed to her, for everyone was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing after Constable Haley except me. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to calm Bess, and telling her to hurry back to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and get properly dressed, for the coroner'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">along in a jiffy and he and the police would be asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions of all the staff, and she couldn't be sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">about before a lot of strangers with only a kimono on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her hair down and no shoes or stockings on. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having got her off, I followed along to have a look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Ben myself. Constable Haley'd covered his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sheet, but he lay there on the floor--nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving him till the coroner came, of course, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I noticed that the cage of the parrot was empty and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bird was dead, too, lying in a mess over by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. I pointed this out to the constable--the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crowd having gone back to talk it all over at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar, and he nodded and said as how he knew, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">law said no corpus delicti could be moved until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coroner gave permission, and as how it didn't say</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether only a human body was a corpus delicti or any</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was, and as both Big Ben and the bird had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">murdered, he wasn't taking any chance of being called</seg><seg type="columnLine">off by the coroner, and was leaving both corpus delictis</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he found them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, sir, after a bit the coroner--who'd been called</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the telephone from Kingston--came in. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short man with a red face and a paunch like a publican,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man named Chermondy, a Welshman I think, or may-</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a Cornishman, but a jolly old boy, bald as an apple</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with keen blue eyes and a funny trick of saying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, well; 'pon my honor!" at everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So as he comes into the Blue Lion he was puffing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blowing, and the first thing he says is, "Well, well!</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Pon my honor! The man's dead. Looks like homicide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'pon my honor, it does!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, he examined Big Ben carefully and kept mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering to himself. "Choked, strangled," he says. " 'Pon</seg><seg type="columnLine">my honor, yes. Garrotted with a thong. Well, well!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he told Constable Haley to get the body on the bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to summon all the staff of the Inn and any outsiders</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had any information to gather in the bar-parlour so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could question them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Ow about yon bird, your honor ?" asks the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stable, jerking his head toward the dead parrot. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird's been murdered, too, I'm thinkin', your worship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tut, tut!" exclaimed the coroner. "How can a bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">be murdered, Constable ? Answer me that, sir. Murder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you should know is, jp legal parlance, homicide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Homicide is derived from' the Latin homo, or man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Homicide means man-killing, and how could the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a bird be homicide, or as you put it, murder? Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well! 'Pon my word, it's amusing! A murdered parrot!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ton my word, that's good. Do with the thing? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">do what you please--throw it out, stuff it, eat it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all I care! Ton my word, yes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Constable Haley was red and flustered. "Did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">'ear 'im ?" he exclaimed, after the coroner had waddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. "Did you 'ear 'im sye as 'ow Hi could heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bloomin'bird ? Heat a parrot, my heye! Hand just</seg><seg type="columnLine">because Hi done me duty an' never laid 'and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpus delicti! 'E's a bloomin', blinkin' blounder, 'e is!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you don't mind, Haley," says I, "I'll take charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bird. I'm not going to eat it any more than you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the coroner said you might stuff it, and being as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was a close friend of Big Ben here, and knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">what store he set by the bird, I'd like to have it as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembrance of him. I'll take it over to Guildford to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the taxidermist there and have it stuffed proper, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put it in a cage so it'll look as life-like as is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tyke hit an' welcome," says he. "Honly never let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me put my heyes hon the blinkin' thing again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We all went into the bar-parlour, where the coroner</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat with a note-book and pencil, and there, before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get seated or begin, came the sergeant of [x&gt;lice</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Esher and the other two constables from Street</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hobham and Church Hobham. Looked quite a bit like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a real police-court it did, and very solemn. Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'd all come to the same mind by now, that is, I had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Nate and Billy Hart and Sam Phillips and Bess and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of us who knew about the stranger over to the Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bear. We are all as cocksure that lie was the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had killed Big Ben as we wanted to be. Who else</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have done it, and why ? And who else had quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reled with him? And why else had Big Ben kept his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol under his pillow ? That gave me a new idea, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wondered why he hadn't shot whoever'd come into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his room and where the pistol was. So I stepped over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Constable Haley and whispered to him about it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went back to Big Ben's room, and pretty soon he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back carrying the pistol and with a queer look on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face. He laid it down before the sergeant, instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the coroner, and saluted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hi found this hunder the deceased man's pillow, sir,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "But has you'll see for yourself, sir, hit's not</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, well! 'Pon my word, what's this ?" exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coroner. "A pistol, eh, and not loaded. Well, well!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must make a note of that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he began questioning the lot of us. First,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carrie the maid, and a hard time he had of it with her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what with her wringing her hands and crying and get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting excited and having to say over and over again how</seg><seg type="columnLine">she'd taken up Big Ben's tea and found him dead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. But with it all never a word that helped, as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see. Then Bess, and Jimmy the porter, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, but no nearer to getting at the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter; but then why should he, when we all knew, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as we wanted to, that the stranger with the scar</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done for Big Ben. 'Twas funny, I thought, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a constable hadn't been sent to arrest him, for even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coroner must have seen by now who the murderer was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEATHERED DETECTIVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">37</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">what with my story and that of Bess and of Nate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone, all telling of the fellow's coming over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he'd said of Big Ben, and how I'd met them quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reling on the roadside and all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN I noticed the sergeant get up and slip out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the door, very quiet like, and I thought to my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self he was going after the stranger. But in that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong, for pretty soon he comes back, and the coroner</seg><seg type="columnLine">then being writing and the place quiet, he goes over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and speaks to him and tells him he's been having a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Big Ben's room. He glares at poor Constable Haley</seg><seg type="columnLine">like as if he'd been a boy caught stealing apples.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A fine credit to the police you are," he says. "Were</seg><seg type="columnLine">you frightened at the corpse?" he asks, sarcastic, "or</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you think a murder was a bally political meeting that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you never so much as looked about for clues? No, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't even find those bloody fingermarks on the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow-ledge and door, nor the deceased's portmanteau and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag slit open and rifled. A fine constable you are, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sure!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, well! Ton my honor!" exclaimed the coroner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's this, sergeant? Fingermarks and bloody, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say! And the bags cut open! Important, very im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant. I must make a note of that. But--but, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear sergeant, why should there be bloody fingermarks?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The deceased came to his death by strangulation--there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no wound, no blood. I made a most careful ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amination."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As to that I can't say, sir," replied the sergeant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe the murderer cut himself, or"--a bright idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him--"maybe the parrot nipped his finger, sir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No doubt he wrung the bird's neck to stop his squalling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and parrots have a nasty way of nipping, you know, sir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At all events he left bloody fingerprints, and I'd sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gest, sir, we have a man from Scotland Yard down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a look at them, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, well. 'Pon my word, yes, sergeant," agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coroner. "And no doubt, as you say, the parrot</seg><seg type="columnLine">nipped the rascal's finger. Let's have a look at the bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see if there's blood on its beak."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, it was there; blood, I mean, but not on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">beak so much as on its feathers about the neck; red</seg><seg type="columnLine">stains on the green feathers as plain as is.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course that settled it. But why, I thought--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I whispered as much to Bess--didn't they send and get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scar-faced fellow before he cleared out?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I didn't have time to say much, for now the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner was standing up most solemn and imposing, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a judge in court--though more like a publican about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a speech on a bank holiday--and clearing his throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and staring about at us over his spectacles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hmm," says he. "I find that the deceased, Benjamin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pollard, otherwise known as 'Big Ben,' came to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">death at the hands of a person or persons unknown, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that suspicion points strongly, most strongly, towards a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman who is or was residing at the Old Bear Inn</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Brenton's Heath, and while it is not within my prov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ince or jurisdiction to do so, I suggest--in fact I ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vise--that the said gentleman be apprehended and placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">under arrest, and that an expert be secured from Scot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land Yard to aid the local police in their investigation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lamentable tragedy that has occurred here in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blue Lion Inn. I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beggin' your pardon, sir," says the sergeant, inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupting him. "But the bird--er, the suspected gentle-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man--has flown, sir. The constable I dispatched to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brenton's Heath reports that the gentleman who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">known by the name of Lemuel Henley has been absent</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Old Bear since yesterday at nine o'clock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning, sir, at which time, sir, he was seen to step</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard a London motor-coach, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, well! Ton my honor!" exclaims the coroner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is very serious. But it merely signifies delay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He will soon be apprehended. Have you notified Lon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don that he is wanted, sergeant?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sergeant nodded. "Yes, sir," he says, "but-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this minute there are hurrying footsteps outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the door opens and who comes rushing in but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger himself! Yes, sir; running straight into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion's jaws, as you might say, and a mighty queer thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a murderer to do, I thought, knowing, as he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have, that the police were at the Blue Lion and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd be the first one to be suspected of doing for Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" he exclaims, before anyone could speak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Is it true? Is it true that Tom--Ben--has been mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered ? I saw it in the News, but I couldn't believe it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">though often I've warned him. I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sergeant was on his feet looking very stern and</seg><seg type="columnLine">officious and all. "It is perfectly true," he says, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you may consider yourself under arrest on the charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the murder of one Benjamin Pollard, owner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blue Lion Inn," says he. "Constable Haley, take charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the prisoner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a minute the fellow with the scar stands there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck dumb as you might say, gaping about at us all</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if not believing his ears. Then he turns redder than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever and his eyes blaze and he takes a step towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sergeant, his head stuck forward and his big fists</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched, and for a moment I thought he was about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You consummate, addle-pated ass!" he spits out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Me, me, the murderer! Why, you blithering idiot, do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think I'd murder my own brother?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, at that we all came near fainting with the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise. The brother of Big Ben! But we might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known it, what with him being so like Ben and all. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't he asked if a Tom Henley was here? And hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">he been registered over to the Old Bear as Lemuel Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley? 'Twas plain as the nose on your face now. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all, that didn't prove he hadn't killed Big Ben.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many a brother's been killed by a brother, and with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own ears and eyes I'd heard and seen the two quarrel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. And this Lemuel fellow'd hinted at dark things</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Big Ben, that time he'd dropped into the Blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sergeant must have thought as much, for as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he'd got over his surprise at the fellow's words he</seg><seg type="columnLine">says: "His brother you may be and then again you may</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be, but, brother or not, you're under arrest, sir."</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a minute I thought the man would knock the ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geant down, so ugly and vicious he looked, but he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the sergeant was in earnest and that 'twas a serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, and suddenly he threw back his big head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose it's your duty, sergeant," he says. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's an ill welcome for me who came here post-haste at</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of my brother's death to be nailed for killing him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when since yesterday noon I've been in London to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour ago." Then, in another tone: "May I see the--</seg><seg type="columnLine">my brother's body?" he asks. The sergeant turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">38</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the coroner, a questioning look on his face, but the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner nodded. "Well, well! Ton my honor, of course;</seg><seg type="columnLine">why not?'' says he; then:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But watch your prisoner carefully, sergeant. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">appears to be a desperate character."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, sir, there's no earthly use going over all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">took place for a time after that. Big Ben was buried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a fine funeral he had, too, with flowers and a silver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trimmed coffin and plumes on the hearse and all, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone in the village out to follow to the grave. Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even the man accused of murdering him was allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attend the services, though guarded by two constables</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that. And I must say he looked as sad and sorrowful</seg><seg type="columnLine">as any.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE chap from Scotland Yard came down to Hob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham, too, a slim young chap, looking more like one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the swells from the West End than a policeman, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nice-spoken chap, although having a bit too much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say to Bess to suit me, though she turned up her nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him, I must say. He fussed around a bit--mostly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben's room, that had been kept under lock and seal since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the murder, the Blue Lion being closed down, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carrie out of a job and Bess at the White Hart and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy, the boots, gone to London or somewhere. Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything set at topsy-turvy over Big Ben's death, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fine pub idle, for you see he hadn't left a will, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least no will had been found, and the place would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to be sold up, only the prisoner, claiming to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Ben's brother and next of kin, if he proved he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Blue Lion would go to him, though what use 'twould</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, if he was found guilty and was hanged, I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as I was saying, the lad from Scotland Yard came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and went back again and what he found or didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">find I don't know. Neither do I know all that went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the hearing of the case of the man with the scar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bess and Carrie and I and the others all had to appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, though we only told the same stories again as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'd told the coroner, and a great waste of time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it. But some of the case I heard and more I</seg><seg type="columnLine">read in the News and more I was told by Constable</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haley and others and most of all by young Roger Keats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barrister. Well, sir, the chap from Scotland Yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">testified as how the blood stains on the window ledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the door weren't blood at all, nor were the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">stains on the bird that I'd had right properly stuffed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the taxidermist at Guildford and that was brought in--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bird, I mean--as evidence, and which everyone said</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as lifelike and natural as is, and you'd almost expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear him croak or squawk. And moreover, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police admitted -that the fingermarks on the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge weren't those of the prisoner, and a doctor who'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been called in swore as to how there wasn't as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a prick or a scratch on his fingers or body anywhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So there they were with that evidence gone west, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">might say. And he--the prisoner, I mean--had letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">posted in Hobham and dated from the Blue Lion Inn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and others from elsewhere, in Big Ben's writing, calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man "Dear Brother Lem" and signed Tom. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally the fellow had half a dozen or more witnesses</seg><seg type="columnLine">who all swore to it that this man, Lemuel Henley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in London all the day and the night when Big Ben</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been murdered, and didn't leave till the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he heard of the matter. So they couldn't find a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">true bill and discharged him. Then he did a queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--and what I thought was a fine, brave thing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">any man to do. And he wasn't called upon to do it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, as you'll see, and it might have got him into a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">fix and into gaol at that. He stood up in the court and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thanks the gentlemen for their fairness and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">verdict. Then he says he intends to find the murderer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his brother, come what may, and he goes on to ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">why 110 one has taken the trouble to find out what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that his brother had kept locked in his bags, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">why Big Ben had gone so often to London. What, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asks, was the motive for the murder? Robbery, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, he says. Who but himself could have known</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was in the bags? he asks. And why? he asks the</seg><seg type="columnLine">court, did his brother go under the name of Benjamin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pollard when his real name was Tom Henley?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, sir, this does make a stir. You see, they'd been</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy trying to find a true bill against him, and they'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">not thought of others. They were that sure he was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right man; and now he'd sprung his letters and his alibi</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all. So they were all at sea, as I might say, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know which way to turn, so all they could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to ask the man they'd accused of murder to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them what he knew about Big Ben's bags and one thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and another. And though he had no cause to do so--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so Roger Keats, who knows the law from A to Zed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">says--the law couldn't have forced him to say anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might incriminate himself, he tells everything. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fine, amazing story that would do for a six-penny</seg><seg type="columnLine">thriller it was at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two brothers had been sailors, Big Ben having</seg><seg type="columnLine">been master and Lemuel mate, and trading in foreign</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts, mostly on the coast of Africa. Then one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">they get some diamonds from a native, and thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe there was a new field thereabouts, they went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the country, and in Basutoland they find the stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">as thick as thorns on a gorse bush. But before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">got off, the government claps the lid on the pot, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">might say, making it law that no one can get diamonds</seg><seg type="columnLine">in there, and neither can they take them out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So there they were in a nice pickle, to be sure, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two brothers without a farthing to their names, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship on the coast waiting, and their wallets full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones that they'd spent every penny and all their time</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting, and the law saying they weren't theirs and liable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be arrested and clapped into gaol if they were found</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Well, sir, they were good British citizens and</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest seamen and respected the law, but that was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. So they made up their mind to separate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so have a better chance,-and to head for the coast, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">from another direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But .Lemuel didn't make it. The constabulary got</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; he had the stones, and though he'd got them all</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the new law was put on into the gaol he went.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the worst of it was he didn't know Avhether Brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom had got clear or not. Not until he got free from</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaol, he didn't, and then he learned the ship had sailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and Tom on it and left him with never a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a shilling, he hadn't. You couldn't blame, him over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">much if he thought bad of his brother at that. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he'd worked his way to England, and found Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left the ship at Portsmouth, and traced him up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hobham, where he was going by the name of Ben Pol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lard, and had bought the Blue Lion and all, why, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could blame him if he thought his brother had tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him the slip and do him?</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEATHERED DETECTIVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LIKE as not I or anyone else would have felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">i same. But when he met Big Ben and had a chat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though heated a bit the words were, he admitted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben told him as how he'd been afraid he'd be nabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hadn't dared write, and that Lemuel's half of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had was safe and waiting, why then they got friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as ever again. And it was diamonds that Big Ben kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his black bag, and to sell the stones, a few at a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he'd been going so frequent to London for. So,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whoever'd killed Ben must have known of what he had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Lemuel, and it wouldn't be hard to find out who</seg><seg type="columnLine">sold stones that hadn't paid duty at that, providing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderer sold them in England, and that didn't seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to me. Well, as I said, Lemuel might have got</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself into trouble by his story, but he didn't, for he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">served his bit for getting the diamonds in Africa; he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought none in, and though Big Ben could have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">jugged for smuggling in the stones, yet being as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond reach of the law, why there wasn't much that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be done, only to order the strong box that Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben had rented in London to be opened and any stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were in it confiscated by the Crown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, sir, that was done, but never a diamond could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be found. Only a lot of letters and papers and bank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">books and such, and ten thousand pounds in notes. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the papers Big Ben's will, which was the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing thing of all, when I heard of it. All the cash</seg><seg type="columnLine">on hand and personal property of Big Ben was left to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brother, Lemuel, and then it went on to say that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he willed the Blue Lion Inn with its furnishings, fix-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, stock-in-trade, good will and interests to Bess and</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, provided we were proper married.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, you could have bowled me and Bess over with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feather, as you might say. All we'd been waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to lay by a tidy bit for a rainy day, and here we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were with a fine pub and all. So we were married the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next day and that's how I come to own the Blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lion, and a right neat living it's brought us these many</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. But with ever and all, and Lemuel well fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for life--and a right decent chap we found him after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all our misjudging him, aye, none better--nobody was</seg><seg type="columnLine">any nearer to finding who'd done for poor Big Ben, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only Lemuel and Bess and myself much interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting at the bottom of the mystery at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then one day, as we were tidying up and getting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blue Lion into shape for business--Bess and I having</seg><seg type="columnLine">got back from a honeymoon down to Folkstone--who</seg><seg type="columnLine">should pop in on us but the American professor chap</seg><seg type="columnLine">who'd been so excited over the green parrot the year</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. Yes, sir, there he was again, goggles and plus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fours and all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha!" says he, beaming all over. "Still here, I see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And here I am, back again." All the time his eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing this way and that, as if looking for something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gracious, yes!" he says. "Here I am again, but I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that most remarkable bird. Do you know," he goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, "I've come all the way from America to this place</seg><seg type="columnLine">solely for the purpose of seeing that bird, and if possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavoring to induce its owner to part with it? I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared to pay anything in reason if-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I'm afraid you've had your trouble for noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, sir," I tells him. "The owner's dead, sir, murdered</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was in this very inn, and the bird as well-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goodness gracious!" he exclaims. "What a dire</seg><seg type="columnLine">calamity! What a tragedy! But I hope that the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was preserved and not cast away," he says, meaning, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">took it, the body of the green parrot and not Big Ben's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded. "Yes, sir," I tells him. "I saw to that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir. Big Ben always took great store by the bird, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had him properly stuffed, by the taxidermist at Guild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford, sir, and a fine job he made of it at that. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">why Big Ben thought so much of it or why you're so</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious about it is more than I can see, for to me it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no better than any other green parrot, and it's only for</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory of Ben that I paid for having it stuffed as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Parrot!" he cried, jumping up and throwing out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands like he was swimming. "Parrot! Oh my sacred</seg><seg type="columnLine">aunt! Parrot indeed 1 Why, goodness gracious, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird was not a parrot. It was a species of touraco--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rare, an exceedingly rare bird of African origin. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">a most remarkable bird. Perhaps in some ways the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable bird, for it's the only bird in the world whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathers are actually green but actually contain red pig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. And this was a unique specimen, a specimen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">captivity. However," he sighed, "better half a loaf than</seg><seg type="columnLine">no bread. Would you care to--er--dispose of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimen ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hmm," says I, as Bess kicks my shins and nods and</seg><seg type="columnLine">winks at me. "So it wasn't a parrot after all. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">most likely Big Ben knew what he was talking of when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd say 'twas a remarkable bird, perhaps the most re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable bird. But as to selling it, well, I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to that, sir. Bess and I set a lot of store by it, seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">as how Ben thought so much of the bird and as how</seg><seg type="columnLine">he left us this pub and all. But then-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, of course!" he interrupts me. "But con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider that you are really doing a great deal for science</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you dispose of the specimen to me. Here in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">inn it will become dusty, moth-eaten and will be event-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually thrown in the rubbish, while in a great museum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with your--er--name upon it, it will be preserved indefi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitely and of benefit to the public. I am-''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not a rich man, sir," I told him, without waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to finish, "but I have a good income and some-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I don't like the idea of selling the bird, as Big Ben</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't listen to selling if^vhen he was alive. But if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bird's to go to a museum, then take it and welcome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I say, for nothing could suit Big Ben better than that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am sure, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, I never before heard and I never expect again</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear such thanks as the Professor--Judson his name</seg><seg type="columnLine">was--gave Bess and me for that stuffed green bird of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Ben's. And what with one thing and another, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">him asking many a question, I told him the whole story</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the murder and of the trial of Lemuel and all. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was right interested in it all, and a sharper chap I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">met, no, not even Roger Keats, what with the things he</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked to seize on and ask about and all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blood! Of course it was not blood," he declared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I told him about the fingerprints. "But it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well have been. And whoever left those marks was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the murderer, of course. And the pistol, not loaded!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did nobody ever ask about that?" says he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not that I know of," I tells him. "It hadn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired and Big Ben hadn't been shot, so it didn't seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have much to do with the matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Judson snorted fit to give one a start.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fools!" he most yells. "Fools, like the police every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. Why, goodness gracious, man alive, that un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded pistol has everything to do with it. Where does</seg><seg type="columnLine">this Mr. Lemuel Henley live? And where is this law-</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">yer--no, barrister I believe they are called over here--</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend of yours have his office? Get them both and we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a talk and I'll wager we find the murderer soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WELL, it didn't take long to get Lemuel and Roger</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keats to the Blue Lion when they heard about</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Professor Judson had said. And all of us went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the back room--the same as Big Ben used to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">for himself and his cronies when many folks were about</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bar-parlour--and there we sat listening to what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor from America had to say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the first place, he pointed out, the unloaded pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved the murderer was someone who had access to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inn and Big Ben's room. "Do you suppose for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute," he asks, "that Big Ben, as j'ou call him, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have bothered placing an empty gun under his pillow?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course not! And didn't the maid report that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">always kept a loaded gun there? Hence," he continues,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"we must assume that he feared robbers or perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies might attack him or attempt to rob him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that on the night in question he believed that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a loaded weapon within reach. In other words, sirs, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">person who plotted to rob, and if necessary murder him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that a loaded gun was always under the pillow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to avoid all chances of being shot or of having the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighborhood aroused by the sound of a shot, he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved the cartridges from the pistol and replaced it</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty and harmless. That much, gentlemen, we may</seg><seg type="columnLine">assume is as well established as though proven in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">court of law. But who was the person?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No doubt, had the weapon been carefully examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fingerprints when first found, the identity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderer could have been established, for beyond any</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt in my mind it was some employee of the inn or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">some one who was stopping here that night-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There were no guests that night," I told him. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">as for the murderer being one of the staff, that's un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinkable, Professor," I says, a bit hotly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tut, tut,"- he says, smiling at me condescendingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of. "I'm accusing no one, but I am attempting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to solve this murder mystery by the means of deduction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now we have deduced that the murderer extracted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charges from the pistol. Hence we may deduce it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone who had access to the room and was familar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with the habits of his victim. I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't agree with you," says Lemuel. "I admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">I expect you're right about the reason for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol being unloaded, but I don't see any reason why</seg><seg type="columnLine">a body shouldn't have come in from outside and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done it. He didn't have to know my brother's habits</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that. He might have been looking about and found</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the pistol by chance. He-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True, quite true!" interrupted the professor. "In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact we have excellent evidence of the fact that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderer did enter or leave by way of the window, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would hardly have been able to enter unseen during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day, and if he had entered and had remained in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, the bird would, in all probability, have squawked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and betrayed his presence, for I understand that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature invariably exhibited dislike of strangers by</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttering its customary raucous notes. That, gentlemen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is one reason I unhesitatingly declare that the murderer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was someone well known to the bird."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're forgetting the bird was killed," says Roger</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keats. "No doubt he killed it to prevent it from giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning of his presence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor snorted again. "And you are forget-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting that the bird was killed after the murder was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted," he said. "Do you imagine that the owner, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">prized the bird so highly as to refuse an offer of five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred pounds for it, would not have noticed that his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pet was killed-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Might have been killed while he was asleep," sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested Roger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Judson smiled. "But you told me he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully dressed," he reminded us. "Though," he added,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I do not deny he may have been sleeping. But even</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, it is inconceivable that the bird should have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged from its cage and strangled without uttering a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry, and what is more, I am prepared to prove, by irre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">futable scientific facts and evidence, that the murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">was committed before the bird was killed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even if such proof is possible and admissible, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot see that it brings us any nearer to the solution</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mystery," said Roger Keats. "Whether the bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">was killed first or whether the murder was committed</seg><seg type="columnLine">first has no direct bearing on the case."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Indeed?" says the professor. "In that you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly mistaken, Mr. Keats. It has a very great bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the solution, in my opinion. It establishes the fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost beyond question, that the murderer was recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized by the bird, and what is more, I am prepared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove in any court that the murderer committed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crime, and finding it impossible to open the bags in</seg><seg type="columnLine">search of the diamonds, left the room and returned, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not until then killed the bird for fear it might give an</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm while he was rifling the murdered man's posses-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''If you could do that," said Lemuel, "then you're no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor; you're a wizard. I've seen many a trick of</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic by those fakirs out East, but not one of 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">could turn the trick you say you can do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a bit of magic about it," declared the professor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But let me ask a question. Was it not raining that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 STOPPED to think for a moment. "Yes," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It was a clear evening, but it must have rained dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the night, for everything was sopping wet next</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. I mind that when I ran after Carrie to the inn</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, the street was all puddles."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Judson grinned. "I knew it," he declared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and if we can determine the time at which rain fell, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can determine the time when the murder was committed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rather the time when the murderer left the room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">later returned to it. But the most important matter is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn the identity of the murderer, and the fingermarks</seg><seg type="columnLine">he left upon the window-ledge are, I should say, our best</seg><seg type="columnLine">clue to that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can't take fingerprints of every blessed person in</seg><seg type="columnLine">England," says Lemuel, "and what's more, whoever 'twas</seg><seg type="columnLine">is most likely out of England long ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goodness gracious, of course not!" says the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor, "but the chances are ten to one the man who com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted this crime is no novice and has committed others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No doubt Scotland Yard could find his fingerprints in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their files. I'm surprised, amazed, that they have not al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready done so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not," says Roger Keats. "Soon as it was proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prints were not made with blood and didn't belong to</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend Lemuel here, they didn't have any bearing on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEATHERED DETECTIVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">.41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My, my, my!" exclaimed the professor. "I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thought they did; indeed I should. But of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not realizing what the red marks were, they would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have regarded them as important as I do. But you see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Keats, even if the red marks were not blood, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">amounted to the same thing, for only the man who killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bird could have left them and only the man who mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered Mr. Henley could have or would have killed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird. In fact, gentlemen, this bird is most remarkable in</seg><seg type="columnLine">more ways than one, and in this case it will be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the bird proved a most excellent, and I might say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">providential witness--an actual detective, I might say."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's all Greek to me," grunted Lemuel. "You're tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing us a lot of things without telling us anything. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the bally old bird has to do with it is beyond me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All in good time, all in good time," smiled the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor. "I dearly love a little mystery, so do let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoy it. And I suggest now that we secure a snapshot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fingerprints and make a visit to Scotland Yard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavor to identify them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Well, that's just what we did, me going along, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaving Bess that full of curiosity as to what 'twas</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about she was fair on needles and pins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we went up to London and Scotland Yard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone seemed to know Professor Judson, even if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an American, and we found the chap who'd been</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the Blue Lion and who'd taken the fingerprints</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all. But he wasn't much interested, and when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told the professor that he'd gone over every fingerprint</seg><seg type="columnLine">on file and not one of them was the same as those from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben's room, even the professor seemed a bit knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. But he was a tenacious chap, was the professor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and once he set himself to an idea he stuck to it like all</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific chaps do, they tell me, and nothing would do</seg><seg type="columnLine">him but he must have a look himself. While the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">chap was getting out the files, we were looking about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there being a lot of bills with pictures of men wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fingerprints and such stuck around, and pretty soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard the professor say "Goodness gracious!" and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned about and there he was staring at a paper on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk as if he'd found another of the green birds there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goodness gracious!" he exclaims a second time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Whose are these fingerprints?" he asks the young chap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing at the paper. The young fellow looked at them</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually. "Oh," says he, "those have just come in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They're from a bird they hooked over in Notting Hill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was with another in a stolen motor car, but swore he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had nothing to do with it, so the police sent over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prints to see if we had him on record here. But we</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't. I expect they'll turn him loose if they haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">done so already. But why do you ask ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Because," snaps the professor, "that man is the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derer of the erstwhile owner of the Blue Lion!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What!" jerks out the young chap, jumping up like</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had sat on a tack. Then he grabs the prints taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Ben's room, puts them beside the others and squints</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them through a reading-glass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">t By gad&gt; you're right!" says he, seizing the telephone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now, who the devil is the fellow? Good Lord, I hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">they've still got him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  rhen, after a few words and orders over the telephone:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's safe," he says, hanging the instrument up. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you say if we go have a look at him?" So off we</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to Notting Hill and into the gaol and down to a cell</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a man sitting inside. He turns around as we look</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and I see his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God, Jimmy!" says I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so 'twas. Jimmy the boots!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TIT'ELL, to make a long story short, of course he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  yy up for a hearing and of course he swore he'd noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to do with it. He even accounted for his finger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prints, saying as how, being in and out of the room often,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd messed some red on his fingers the day afore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder and had meant to clean up where he left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks but was that upset by Ben's death and all that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear forgot it. His barrister demanded he be set free,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying as how there was no evidence against him and only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flimsy charges of an alien and a scientist with an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agination who'd imagined himself an amateur Sherlock</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holmes. But he didn't know Professor Judson; not him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So when Roger Keats got up, all primed with questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">written down by the professor, he turns to Jimmy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">says he, "Will you be good enough to state why you left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room after the murder was committed and before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bird was killed ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I could see Jimmy turn pale at that, but he swore he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">never been in the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And why was it necessary to destroy the bird, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">wringing its neck?" asked Roger Keats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Jimmy twisted a bit, but he swore he knew nothing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," persisted the barrister, "you must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that it had begun to rain while you went for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife. You got quite wet, did you not? And who did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you hear or think you heard that prevented you from</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving by the door rather than go out a second time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rain? You must have heard something that caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to go out by the window after all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Well, with that Jimmy collapsed. He was a ratty sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyhow, a sly little cockney, but no backbone to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he knew Roger Keats had him cornered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He confessed everything and was tried and convicted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was never hanged. He died in prison, being as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much scared to death as anything, I expect, and he vowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the last he'd never got a stone or as much as a gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">sovereign for murdering poor Big Ben.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what puzzled me and Lemuel and Roger Keats</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rest was how the professor knew about Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the room and it raining, and him waiting at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and being scared and going out the window and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor grinned when we asked him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goodness gracious!" he said. "It was very simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed. You see, as I have already told you, the bird is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a most remarkable one. Not only do its feathers con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain green pigment, but that pigment is more or less fugi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive. In other words, it 'runs' when wet, but instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">'running' as a green color, it turns to red. The moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw the stuffed bird with the red stains on its feathers</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew that the man who had throttled it had to do so</seg><seg type="columnLine">with wet hands. I also knew that it must have been his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers and hands that had left the red stains on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window-ledge and door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It was quite obvious also that the murder had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">committed before the bird had been killed, otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would have been red marks on the murdered man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat or clothing or on the cord that had been used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangle him.

It is true, here and there, in this part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world and that, poverty reared its ugly head. Misery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and want, the innumerable indignities of life--even in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">security, still existed, often side by side with immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">power and wealth. But taken as a whole, the world in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of the Twentieth Century presented a picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of general prosperity far surpassing any period that went</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Truly man had become like unto the gods. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">consummate skill and marvelous ingenuity the materials</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the entire earth were called upon to minister to every</seg><seg type="columnLine">want of mankind--nay, even every whim.

Everything on the face of the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under its surface, in the water, in the very air, was sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject to man's will.

That has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the great blot, the reproach upon the character of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind.

Washington was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">decked with flags and gay colors; and the multitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently stood at every available vantage point bravely</seg><seg type="columnLine">enduring the discomfort of the inclement weather in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to view the inauguration ceremony. In spite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather the spirit of festival was in the air; the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">capital was gay and holiday-bent. Foremost citizens and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaders in all walks of life from all over the nation, diplo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mats and representatives from every land on earth were</seg><seg type="columnLine">there on this auspicious occasion--nay, lent color and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignity by their very presence. Something of this spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">was even wafted on the instantaneous wings of the radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the far corners of the world. No more impressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene than this can be imagined than this symbol of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glorious sovereignty of a great people, this visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendor of a mighty, prosperous and peaceful nation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The swearing in of the new president had just been</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed. The vast crowds which had been viewing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremony, listening in by means of numerous amplifiers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were commencing to move about; when suddenly, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proverbial thunderclap out of a clear sky, an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mensely large globe appeared immediately over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Capitol grounds. It dropped down on the plaza right in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the inauguration platform; and in settling</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly -- yet apparently under control -- barely missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushing the life out of hundreds of people who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving about. There was a loud commotion and mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">scramble to get out of the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Great was the excitement and curiosity aroused all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city. News of the strange happening quickly found</seg><seg type="columnLine">its way over radio and news column. Even the inaugural</seg><seg type="columnLine">parade, about to begin, and recorded as the most splendid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in history, was forgotten by many.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And no wonder. It was no little thing which had so</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpectedly landed right in the midst of all these fes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tivities at the very steps of the nation's Capitol; it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extremely large globe over three hundred feet in dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meter, of a silvery white metal and highly polished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The first fleeting impression created on all observers</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that a solid globe of metal had come down. But, no.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After the first shock of surprise this impression was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly dispelled by the orderly appearance of the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, and its rapid but perfectly controlled landing; what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seemed a solid sphere was now seen to be pierced</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rows of symmetrically spaced circular windows. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, the distinct whirring and throbbing of mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines could be heard. There it stood, shimmering in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight which by now had burst through the clouds--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of beauty to behold. Its weight, however, must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been enormous, for the bottom of the sphere, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">on closer observation was slightly flattened, settled slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the pavements and surrounding ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Astonishment soon gave way to impatience, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">to anger. The huge globe obstructed everything in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">path. For a long time it gave not the slightest sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, although everybody around waited impatiently for</seg><seg type="columnLine">its occupants to emerge. That it was an aerial vehicle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some sort--of that there could be no doubt. The police</seg><seg type="columnLine">on duty forced their way through the densely packed mob</seg><seg type="columnLine">to obtain the identity of the parties in the vehicle, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">upbraid them for their temerity and bad judgment in</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing in such a place and on such an occasion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But here was a dilemma indeed; there was no point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance and no one appeared from the inside to whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders might be given, or of whom questions might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. The crowds in ever-increasing numbers milled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">around and around rendering the police utterly helpless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all very interesting, but also highly exasperating.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the huge size and weight of the object rendered im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediate removal out of the question. Ihe police stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">around in perplexity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Naturally there was much speculation as to what and</seg><seg type="columnLine">where this strange vehicle came from, and to whom it</seg><seg type="columnLine">belonged; for here was evidently a new mode of aerial</seg><seg type="columnLine">transportation, unguessed and unheard of. All this specu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation was natural and aroused great admiration and</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity; but there was also great irritation with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilots, whoever they were, as to their manner of arrival</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a fine place indeed to choose for a landing! Life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">limb was saved by a miracle. It was assumed, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they came from some foreign country, as it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been almost impossible to construct--much less fly--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vehicle of that kind in this country without it having</seg><seg type="columnLine">been widely known and heralded in advance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was not long thereafter, however, when signs of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the huge sphere commenced to take place. Interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">became intense. Some of the circular windows began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">open inward with a screwing movement; parts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface seemed to detach themselves and formed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">platforms, and openings appeared disclosing some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior. The crowds became uncontrollable, and surged</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward expectantly. Still no sign of a human being</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Just as the officials of law and order were discussing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways and means of forcible entry, a number of strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking objects appeared in one of the openings, then took</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the air in slow circular flights around the globe; finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">settling on a large platform which extended about ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet from the ground. These small flying contrivances--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for such they were--disk-like in shape, were about three</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in diameter; and on top of each, guiding it, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange looking creature. It was hard to determine which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the animate, and where the purely mechanical part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the contrivance began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The police finally managed to rope off a space sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding the globe; and forthwith a number of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange beings, or whatever they were, settled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground where they were seen to better advantage. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer view was positively electric in its effect on the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">server. On top of each of the before mentioned flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">disks, in a sort of hollow formed therein, sat, or stood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or iay--it was impossible to determine which--a being</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the most beautiful appearance imaginable. The body</seg><seg type="columnLine">had about it something of the appearance of a big beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful sea shell, was somewhat conical in shape, the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">part convoluting gracefully; and at its dull apex, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned slightly forward, were three bright gray eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rounded sides showed three arm-like members, slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">and supple, which were endowed with a number of deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate tenacula; these members they seemed able to extend</seg><seg type="columnLine">or withdraw into their bodies at will. The whole body</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsed and shimmered, and was of a beautiful iridescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">color. Their average weight was perhaps about one hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and fifty pounds. They wore various small pouches</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended by silken cords, which were fashioned of flexi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble metallic-like material; from these they extracted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of queer articles, some of which were very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">like writing pads and pencils. That these creatures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange in form yet elegant to behold, were no mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">animated things, but possessed of high intelligence, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly evident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When night came on the mysterious globe scintillated</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE EARTH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with myriads of lights, which shone from its numerous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">round openings. Numbers of these queer beings flew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hither and thither about the city in their little flying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">machines, small but powerful searchlights flashing; evi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dently examining and studying what they could, while all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">night long immense throngs crowded around the Capitol</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grounds seeking to get as close as the police lines per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mitted. It was all very mystifying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">/ I ' HE strange thrilling truth at last dawned on every-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  1 body; the scarcely believable truth, that in some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">miraculous manner strange living things, not of this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earth, were here before them--living, thinking, tool-using</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beings, perhaps just as surprised at seeing us as we were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to see them. The thing was incredible, unreal, beyond</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">belief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For ages man and his forbears had always dealt with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">life and the things of this earth, and beyond the academic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">interest of astronomers, pursued his activities as if his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">planet were the only one really existing--the shining stars</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but ornaments for his edification. But here for the first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time man was brought face to face, as it were, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the outside universe. What at first was thought to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">foreign visitors in a new idea of aviation, turned out to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be visitors from another world in outer space. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mighty repercussion of interest aroused by such an event</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beggars description. It was like the first thrill of a mil-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lion Lindberghs multiplied a thousand fold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Great screaming headlines appeared in all the news-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">papers about "other world visitors," "Mars" and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Venus." Long columns were written about the various</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">planets of the Solar System, including a great deal that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was speculation, particularly about the "Martians," and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their supposedly older and higher civilization. Overnight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">astronomical subjects became the leading topic of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  What was to be done ? Officials racked their heads as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the proper procedure. For one thing, no one knew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">how best to approach the queer visitors, nor how to estab-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lish intercommunication. Even with the most alien of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">humans one knows what to do--the need of creature com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">forts, shelter, food; but these beings who had so un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">expectedly introduced themselves into our midst were so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bewilderingly different, so utterly unlike anything</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">imagined. Somehow it had always been taken for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">granted--naively so--even in most tales dealing with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">imaginary life on other planets, that if thinking beings</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">existed thereon they most likely possessed characteristics</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of a human mold. The natural viewpoint of man makes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it hard to conceive otherwise. To be sure, after the true</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nature of our guests was recognized, it was greatly de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sired to accord them the welcome they deserved, to extend</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to them every comfort and courtesy--befitting this amaz-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing event. But there was no end to take hold of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was finally decided on a committee to formally wel-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come our astonishing visitors from another world. Promi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nent among the welcoming delegation were: Secretary of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">State George B.

They had with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them large scale charts of the Solar System and stellar</seg><seg type="columnLine">constellations; and by graphic means endeavored to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse with the celestial visitors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That they evidently understood our meaning was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately obvious; for one of them who seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leader waved a wand-like staff and at once a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">easel-like stand was brought from within the sphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This stand was covered with white material; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader, taking a pencil from one of his pouches, rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and skilfully sketched a sidereal chart of the heavens as</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed from our Solar System. Then, pointing to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiral nebula in the northern constellations, he made an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enlarged drawing of it, laid his wand on one of the stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which it was composed, and made it perfectly plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the visitors came from that spot in space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  1 his nebula to which he pointed, was recognized as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Great Nebula of Andromeda, designated in astrono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mical catalogues as N. G. C. 223. It is one of the hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of thousands of extra-galactic nebula scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in far off space. A number of the spiral nebulas had at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last been resolved in our largest telescopes, and are defi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitely placed by leading astronomical authorities as way</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beyond the uttermost limits of our Sidereal Uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse ; in fact are distinct and entirely separate universes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">immeasurably farther than the most remote star in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milky Way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> _ The Great Nebula of Andromeda, from which our</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitors had so dramatically come, is distant about a mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion light-years from our Solar System. Visible to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked eye as a hazy star of the fourth magnitude, viewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a large telescope it is one of the most magnificent</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects in the heavens. It is the largest known of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the spiral nebula, and is in reality an incomprehensibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast system composed of hundreds of millions of stars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar in size and physical structure to those of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own universe. The whole system is so remote that its</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual stars are indistinguishable except by the largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescopes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After further efforts it was learned that the home of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our visitors was a small planet approximately the size of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our Earth, revolving about a star somewhat larger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sun. This was all the information it was possible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get at the time from the celestial voyagers, due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great difficulty of a mutual medium of understanding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was only by means of astronomical charts and descrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive drawings on both sides that the above information</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be gleaned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Words cannot describe the tremendous sensation this</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused throughout the entire world. It crowded every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing off the front pages of newspapers altogether. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, so strange and so unbelievable was all this, as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause a feeling of doubt to persist in many of the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed quarters. Eminent savants in Germany, France</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other countries wrote learned treatises relative to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subject, analyzing the possible from the impossible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was even a widespread feeling that some gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoax had been perpetrated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For one thing, how could anything within any con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceivable lifetime succeed in bridging the vast unthinkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">distances separating our mite of a world from this outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe ? According to our knowledge the speed of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the fastest possible speed in the universe. And a</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">simple calculation sufficed to prove, though fast as light</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, traveling with the inconceivable speed of over one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and eighty-six thousand miles a second, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous speed is but a snail's pace, when it comes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">interstellar distances. How, then, could this strange craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever have bridged a distance which takes light itself the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unthinkable time of one million years to span. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">preposterous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And yet, here was stark truth in evidence. Outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the human species there was no other bom of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth capable of such high powers of thinking and co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinated activities. The extra-mundane derivation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these strangely formed beautiful beings could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted by all those who saw them. They seemed unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move about without their email mechanical vehicles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which responded to their every touch; on the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">up or down, in any direction--at least no one saw them</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart. These vehicles were of the same metallic substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that of the huge sphere, and they moved about in them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with scarcly a sound, with no more effort than we do</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For seven days our extra-terrestrial sojourners, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom there were several hundred, remained where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were. Efforts were made to invite them into our midst,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and minister to their comforts, although no one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell what these comforts might be. Beyond entering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Capitol, White House and other places, they did not seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to need or care for anything. The Andromedans, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">named them, moved and flew about here and there, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amining, testing everything with which they came in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact. Vegetable growths in particular seemed to interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">them highly; they hovered about trees, bushes and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">growths for long periods. A passing dog or other animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">would draw their interest immediately; they would con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verge on it in numbers for study, and the animal would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flee in great fright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A scientific committee spent every minute possible in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the company of the visitors, seeking to learn what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could. They in turn were not only interested in our ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forts at interchange of intelligence, but seemed interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">and puzzled at the construction of the human body, prod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding and touching us constantly--a mildly uncomfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience, because their bodies were slightly charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with electricity.	fe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  During all this time very little more was learned re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding the Andromedans. Their mentality, and ours</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to offer no common ground for easy communica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. They appeared to have no head, as we know it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no ears, nose; nor any other of the animal organs which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are wont to associate with intelligent life. As to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more intimate details regarding these beings, such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">anatomical functions as well as means of contact with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the objective, our understanding was very limited; inso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as it was impossible to examine them more</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then one morning the huge sphere gracefully lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the ground slowly like a mountainous bubble, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an immense roar of machinery, floated off at an increas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly great speed in an easterly direction. Everyone was</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointed to see them go; and large numbers watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the huge craft became a mere speck on the horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ships at sea reported sighting the sphere moving with</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible speed over the Atlantic. A few hours after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards word was received from Belgium that the An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dromedans had landed there, about ten kilometers from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Antwerp, causing great excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After a two days stay in Belgium, during which time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most eminent sicentists of Europe did their best to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get what information they could, the Andromedans moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">on and landed in Germany, near Munster. They stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">there a few days, causing the most tremendous furor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">many journeying from England and far points of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">continent to view the strange sight with their own eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doubt of the extra-mundane origin of the strangers could</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer be entertained. Everywhere the Andromedans</seg><seg type="columnLine">went they were followed by vast swarms of curious hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manity, often so overwhelming in their forward surgings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the best efforts of police and military guards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the visitors many times had to rise into the air to</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid being crushed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For over a month the strangers in their flying globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved on; stopping in Russia, China, India, and touch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing here and there, humanity eager and all agog. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft was continually sighted in various parts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, though, at the last, seldom landing. Finally no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more was seen or heard of the space voyagers. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">totally disappeared as suddenly and mysteriously as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appeared. It was assumed that they departed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this Earth to continue their interstellar voyaging. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many years the thrilling visit of the Andromedans</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained an interesting subject of discussion in wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">circles and in much print.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWENTY-FIVE years passed by. Beyond the mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">records of fact, the world had completely forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stirring visit of life from another universe. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving pictures of the event, a few stray photographs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their far-off homeland the visitors left behind--that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all there was left to record. Outside of the knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">that intelligent life in a strange form existed in a far-off</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinpoint of space, and the immense impetus given the</seg><seg type="columnLine">study of astronomy, the world was not changed one bit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The even tenor of its existence went on from generation</seg><seg type="columnLine">to generation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The world slowly improved, ever growing more ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficient, more comfortable, more sanitary--and even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">just. But the daily things of life, the good and the bad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued just the same as they always have done for</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages back. For however the outer forms of civilization</seg><seg type="columnLine">may change, be it remembered that regardless of his ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial improvements, the inner life of man, his basic feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings and emotions, change but little--and these very</seg><seg type="columnLine">very slowly. The same old vanities, the same old bigotries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same old hatreds existed, with their resulting strife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and miseries. And yet, there was no doubt about it; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world as a whole had grown better--much better and</seg><seg type="columnLine">happier. Little did the world know or appreciate how</seg><seg type="columnLine">well off it was. Had humanity had an inkling of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragic drama about to be enacted, the inconsequential</seg><seg type="columnLine">things of life, so important to many, would have seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifling indeed. The soul of man was soon to be tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fire--his very existence doubtful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Suddenly, on June 5, 1962, with a suddenness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggers the imagination, the same strange beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings which had stirred our world of a generation ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared once more. This time, however, there arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a hundred of their huge metallic spheres, somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger even than the first one of twenty-five years ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The immense fleet landed in open ground eleven miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">east of Cincinnati.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The excitement and astonishment caused by this second</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of the Andromedans, defies description. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE EARTH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the times of which we write, mechanical advancement</seg><seg type="columnLine">had progressed at such an accelerating rate that almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody could reach almost anywhere very quickly; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the day these huge globes landed was the week-end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast throngs from great distances motored and flew to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot--it takes very little to attract the multitude.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many even flew clear across the Atlantic to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange sight. Once again the whole world was thrilled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its innermost core.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That the Andromedans this time had come for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of important business was soon evident. For shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">after landing, their spherical vessels formed into a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle, and began disgorging vast quantities of machinery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and supplies. As each craft was manned by many hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of these exotic beings, it can readily be seen that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were several score thousand of them; each moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">about in his graceful little airmobile, as we called it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A scene of tremendous activity commenced, the like</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which was never seen by human eye. With powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery of immense size, the Andromedans began</seg><seg type="columnLine">excavating, leveling, and building over a large area many</seg><seg type="columnLine">square miles in extent. A concrete picture of what their</seg><seg type="columnLine">unthinkably remote homeland must be like began to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. Huge structures, many over a thousand feet high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily formed to rear their vast hulks from their deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">foundations. And strangely beautiful they were too, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly different. The circle and oval, the ellipse and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiral, were the predominating motifs. All their buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">were circular or oval in shape, gigantic in size, set well</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart, the intervening spaces serving as streets. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there piercingly tall towers, two to three thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in height, spiraled their graceful way up towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky. They constructed their materials right on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot. Wherefrom they obtained the enormous power</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to their operations was a mystery. At night</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole sky for miles around was aflame with the fires</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their industry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gradually more and more was learned of the nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our extra-mundane guests, which the short visit of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">generation ago did not permit. Their power of sight, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">instance, was considerably different from the human.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their eyes, of which they possessed three, were very</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobile, being located at the tip of three stubs; and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like ours they had the power of magnification, which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">exert at will, when focusing on minute or distant objects.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In addition, they had another sense which we humans</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack--another sort of an eye, at the base of the triangle</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed by the others, by means of which they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">register rays of the ultra-violet, thereby enabling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andromedans to see things forever invisible to us. Hear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing they had none, nor could our authorities find any</seg><seg type="columnLine">traces of the sense of smell, although our visitors reacted</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently in the presence of putrescence. Neither did they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the power of speech, which, however, was no draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to them, as they conversed among themselves by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of signs, incomprehensible to us, but which their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultrapowerful eyes enabled them to carry on even in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark and at great distances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Natural foods, such as we earthly creatures enjoy, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not need. Their nourishment was of their own com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding, made from the natural elements, of which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">partook' by means of an organ in the center part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. They did not seem to need the intermediation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants or animals for their sustenance; but had the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">to absorb and assimilate and build their bodies directly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as only some of our plant life can. They did need air,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and consumed large quantities of water. The metabolism</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very low, and waste products negligible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The most interesting thing about them was their sex</seg><seg type="columnLine">--or rather lack of sex. We learned the amazing fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these beings were extremely long of life, their aver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age age running into several thousand years, equaled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">duration only by our California Sequoias. Death, such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">afflicts us mortals, is a thing undreaded with them; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their deaths are births, and their births are deaths, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">offspring retaining even the memories of their imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diate parents for the duration of their individual life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Andromedans are monosexual; a form which, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacking in interest from our viewpoint, nevertheless has</seg><seg type="columnLine">its advantages by keeping their kind from division into</seg><seg type="columnLine">two highly attractive but often antagonistic camps. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">a point of their life comparable to our very ripe ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turity, the mutual attraction of two Andromedans re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults in the beginning of a growth in each, which con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinues until the parent, usually at an extreme age, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally discarded, thus giving birth to two individuals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never more nor less. Or it would be more correct to say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that two partly grown individuals take the place of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parents. This form of birth is always a joyful event</seg><seg type="columnLine">and is the occasion for much celebration. The offspring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at birth are already part grown, or rather, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be more correct to state, that for a long time they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the body of the parent, gradually usurping its</seg><seg type="columnLine">entity, until at a certain point the parent dies, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">children take on a separate existence. This, too, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though not quite agreeable to our senses, has its' ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantages--the parent always knows the whereabouts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its children, and the children, after separation, may not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to worry about possible burdensome parents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Andromedans, although beautifully built and</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly sensitive, are incapable of rapid self-locomotion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They have three appendages by means of which they can</seg><seg type="columnLine">move about, but these are entirely too short and unfit</seg><seg type="columnLine">for rapid progress either through long disuse or by</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature; their movement was very slow and creepy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Practically every minute of their life, except during</seg><seg type="columnLine">periods of rest which were very short, they spent in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">little airmobiles, much as we do in our clothes. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of these they became very swift and active indeed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our scientists, who were free to study the strangers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ways without any hindrance whatsoever, found</seg><seg type="columnLine">these small flyers extremely interesting. As mentioned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a former place, these were small concaved disks in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Andromedans went about and did their ' work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long ago they discovered the related nature of gravi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation and electricity as being basically one and the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing; and so have been able to devise a way of insu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating these disks, so as to free themselves at will from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attraction of gravity. The means by which this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done was, however, so extremely complicated as to defy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thorough understanding of our scientists; although</seg><seg type="columnLine">they derived some very valuable ideas, which, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped, will some day bear fruit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Andromedans were entirely peaceable beings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We looked in vain for any signs of querulousness, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">any sort of combativeness. They went about all happily-</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged in their various pursuits. Their greatest urge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and passion seemed to be work and activity. To describe</seg><seg type="columnLine">their social organization, as well as other interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">features, would take too long and is beyond the scope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this short narrative; the interested student, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">may obtain this at the proper sources.</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT though the Andromedans went ahead steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">about their business of building, erecting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">altering--the reasons for much of which we could but</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess--apparently offering no harm ; nevertheless they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were excavating and otherwise changing enormous tracts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of land on which were many prosperous farms, small</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlements and public highways. All this was done with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out previous notice or permission. They simply concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated at any chosen spot a vast amount of equipment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and commenced operations on such a titanic scale and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such large numbers, that one just had to move on. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">so a great hue and cry went up, particularly from the far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mers and small villagers whose property rights were thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">violated without any notice whatsoever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As the activities of the Andromedans continued, they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">became more and more objectionable, to say the least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And the complaints of the dispossessed and often home-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">less property owners became ever louder. Something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had to be done. However, as the local authorities did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wish to be rude in any way to the celestial visitors, nor to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be criticised by the interested outside world for untoward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">action--most likely they had no understanding nor idea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of what we had long ago come to consider as property</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rights--an effort was made to communicate with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Andromedan leaders in order to explain to them the dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">comfort and grievous losses they were causing many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">citizens. Also at the same time the authorities wanted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to know the why of their building operations, which by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this time were beginning to assume immense proportions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly, Sheriff Harold S. Lowell, of Hamilton</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">County, requested the group of scientists who were in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">constant touch, to explain the serious situation to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">newcomers, so that their stay would be as pleasant and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">non-irritating as possible; to convey our desire to treat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them with the utmost cordiality and good will. No one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the time thought that their second visit to our earth,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">although on a much larger and more active scale, was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">anything more than transitory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This approach was made. But although every effort</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was made, either they would not, or could not, be made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to understand our ingrained repugnance to the violation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of property rights. Speech, as we know it, they had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">none. But they learned to write our language, and we in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turn learned to write theirs. A deal more was learned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the Andromedans concerning their home world</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and manner of existence. And the salient facts of their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">existence ran something like this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Their cosmic system, located in one of the spirals of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Great Nebula of Andromeda, on the far side, unlike</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">our Solar System, was a binary, so common in siderial</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">space. It consisted of a sun larger than ours, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around it revolved a small dark companion about the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">size of our earth which was their home. The physical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nature of their planet was remarkably like ours, which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it resembled in its make-up of land, water and mete-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">orological conditions, except that their planet contained</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about twice our proportion of surface land area, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only about half of the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Vegetation and other forms of life they did not know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  of; or if they ever did exist, they had practically no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  record of it. For ages and ages as far as their knowl-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  edge went, they were the only form of life on their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  world, there being no other kind coexistent as in our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  world. They found so few records of former life, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  these were so fragmentary in their nature, that although</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  they knew that some time in the remote past there had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been other life on their planet, it was so long ago that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the very existence of it had been forgotten. Due . to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some cataclysm or other causes of which they themselves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">didn' know the origin or nature, the Andromedans did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not have a complete record of their descent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Their numbers ran into six trillions. So crowded had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">living conditions become for them on their planet, which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we named in our records as Androm, that their habita-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions had made of it one vast continuous city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About seventy-five thousand years ago living con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ditions and requirements had become so intense, that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">practically the final limit had at last been readied--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in spite of all their science and all their art. They had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long ago perfected a means of traveling through space;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and for scores of thousands of years their space travelers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had covered abysmal distances throughout their own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">universe and many others, seeking another world fit to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">live on. And always and a3 far as they went, and where-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever they went, they found space void and lifeless; the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">infinite number of bodies it contained uninhabited and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">uninhabitable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For strange to say, although most of us on this earth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had always taken it for granted otherwise, our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Andromedan visitors informed us that life--any kind of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">life--is a rare phenomenon indeed throughout the length</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and breadth of infinite space; that so far as they had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">discovered--and they had covered incomprehensibly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vast reaches of space--there was no other life extant,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">excepting on their planet Androm and our planet Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They found our galactic universe and other universes,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">although containing uncountable numbers of stars and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other forms of matter--these were all either too hot or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">too cold, too small or too large, their physical content</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and form in some way entirely unsuited to support the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vital processes of life. Even when they did find a body</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in itself suitable, it was either too close to its luminary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or too far, its axial inclinations too oblique or its orbital</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">path too extreme, or the warmth giving rays were of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">kind destructive to life altogether. In short, the con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ditions which give birth to life and permit the vital pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cesses necessary for its continuance, are so infinitely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rare, so complicated, of such a rare combination of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">causes--the necessary fine balance so easily upset; that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">life, though plentiful on the two planets, was the most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rare thing in the whole Universe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Andromedans had reached a marvelously ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced plane in their arts, their sciences and engineering</seg><seg type="columnLine">skill; and were able to bring about enormous trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming works, greatly controlling the weather and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other conditions. But they needed the kind of atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere we do, also water, and plenty of it; neither could</seg><seg type="columnLine">they thrive, mainly for reasons of gravity, on a world</seg><seg type="columnLine">much larger or smaller than our Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   And so, when they first sighted our system twenty-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">five years ago, they were impressed with the beauty and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">changing colors of our Earth. They decided 011 a closer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inspection before moving on, slackening their tremen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dous speed accordingly. While still far away, there was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that about the appearance of our planet which interested</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them more than any other they had seen before. _ Their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">powerful telescopes revealed thrilling signs of what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could only be explained by the possible existence of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">W'hen they landed, and saw that terrestrial conditions</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' were tolerable for them, and that above all there was life,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they were as stunned as we were to see them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">At last, here was a world to colonize, to take the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE EARTH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plus population of their world! It took them twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">years to return to Androm; and the news which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought was received with great joy and relief. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">world had practically given up finding another livable</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe, and certainly never expected to find life anywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">on any other than their own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately a great expedition was fitted out and sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeding its way toward the Milky Way. It took con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">summate skill to find again our speck of a solar system</seg><seg type="columnLine">--our sun being only one of the billions the galaxy con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains. Also the disconcerting news was imparted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were but the advance guard; that many other ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peditions were being fitted out as rapidly as possible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow on their heels; for the biologic pressure of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing population, although very slowly increasing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had now become absolutely unendurable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our physicists and astronomers were greatly puzzled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, by what means they were able to bridge such</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast distances in such a short time as twelve years. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as near as they could gather--for the understanding of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">required the knowledge of complicated mathematical</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations and physical laws which it would take years to</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand, much less to fully master--tlie Androme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dans had a means of rapid acceleration that had no abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lute limit. This acceleration they could increase at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">geometrical ratio, till they went with the speed of light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once the critical speed of light was reached, the ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws of time, 6pace, matter and velocity ceased to oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate. They moved as if in another dimension, enabling</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to attain a speed which covered interstellar dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tances as an airplane covers earthly distances. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, they were able to decelerate by the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">means. In their long voyaging they sometimes passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely through a gaseous nebula, hardly knowing it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many of these gaseous nebulae are millions of times</seg><seg type="columnLine">more rarefied than any artificial vacuum. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped with special delicate instruments to automatic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally avoid accidental collision with bodies of harmful</seg><seg type="columnLine">size. Thus we see that the marvel of mind has always</seg><seg type="columnLine">been its ability to circumvent, as it were, or rather to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take advantage of, the unknown laws of nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the meantime, the Andromedans and their works</seg><seg type="columnLine">became increasingly interesting, and excited every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's imagination. They were the leading news feature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The entire world was kept informed, and they who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not take in the sights on the spot saw and heard with</seg><seg type="columnLine">unabated interest the doings of the Andromedans over</seg><seg type="columnLine">their televisors and radios.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what was at first a highly interesting event--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doings of these other world beings were extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting and on a truly majestic scale--became in time</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat disconcerting; for it took on all the earmarks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a permanent settlement. And as their activities</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew and spread, ever including more and more area, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">authorities began to be alarmed. It was also feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some of the irate farmers, whose homes and farms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were destroyed, would take matters into their own hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and resort to firearms--thereby creating an unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">complication. For what cared they about the romance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of other world visitors, when their homes were at stake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The local authorities, scarce knowing what to do in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this unprecedented situation, and feeling that it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become a matter of more than local importance, appealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Governor Whalen. However, as the State author-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ities neither would countenance nor wished the use of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> force, it was decided it would be best to leave the An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dromedans alone. Besides, the general opinion was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if kept within bounds the tremendous industry of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange settlers would add enough to the general wealth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to more than make up for the few square miles they</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied. The upshot of the whole matter was that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ohio Legislature, approved by the Governor, voted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the State Treasury indemnification amounts cover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the losses suffered by the dispossessed landowners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also the Andromedans were enjoined from extending</seg><seg type="columnLine">their operations beyond certain specified boundaries</seg><seg type="columnLine">without conforming to our established laws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was soon found that this did not help matters for</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. And to add to the growing seriousness of the sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uation, some months after the first arrival, another ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedition as large as the first landed alongside the first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From then on a constant stream of new arrivals came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing Andromedans by the scores of thousands, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their first center spread out farther and farther.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time a year had gone by the situation had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown serious to the last degree. Their ever-spreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">activities reached and threatened the environs of Cin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinnati, and had swallowed up all the villages around.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They even bridged the Ohio, and commenced their</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations in Kentucky. The State authorities, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had exhausted all their efforts to keep the peace, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their wits' end. The situation was all the harder to</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle in so far as these beautiful intelligent beings were</seg><seg type="columnLine">very gentle and seemed totally harmless. Except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their usurpation of property and land, not a human hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been touched. They just didn't seem to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">our laws. So far there had been a constant friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">intercourse. Our experts aiid men of learning gleaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">many valuable processes of a practical nature. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andromedans were marvelous technicians and artists;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they showed us a few tricks, particularly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">realms of metallurgy, chemistry and mechanics, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made our experts feel like rank novices. Just the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">we watched their activities with growing concern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when a great important city like Cincinnati ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be in the path of certain destruction, it became</seg><seg type="columnLine">a different matter altogether. Things had gone entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">too far. The bewildering situation had taken on such</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous proportions that it was too big to be easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">handled. It was like an insidious growth in the body, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which growth one does not attach full significance until</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is too late. Everyone suddenly woke up to the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger. And the governors of Ohio and Kentucky, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">caring to assume responsibility for a state of affairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they felt had grown beyond their control, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to throw the whole matter into the hands of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Federal authorities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Realizing that here was a condition of affairs fraught</seg><seg type="columnLine">with possible dynamite, the consequences of which no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one could foresee, the Federal authorities decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take active steps toward a solution of the problem. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andromedans were Informed in a courteous but firm</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner that their spreading activities were highly ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectionable. They could remain where they were, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were already settled, by contributing in kind to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general welfare. But all further spreading must cease</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether and immediately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time intercommunication had so progressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the new settlers fully understood our demands. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it plain to us, however, that they wished no harm as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our life and human activities; but inexorable necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">forced them to take whatever space was needed for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever enlarging population. And as furthermore great</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers of their kin were on the way, and would con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue to come in a vast migration to our planet, that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">humans had best get accustomed to the idea right now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and live our own life as best we may, without bothering</seg><seg type="columnLine">or interfering with them, even though their usurpation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">land conflicted with our rights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, all this was utterly preposterous. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tantamount to conquest of part of our fair land, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be suffered in any degree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the constant arrival of these strange beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">from another universe which was the most alarming</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about the whole business. The quiet persistent</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure of their peaceful infiltration, the rapid spread of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their enormous engineering and building works, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced an ever growing tenseness in an utterly undreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of situation. They were changing entirely the land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scape wherein their activities centered. Had they been</seg><seg type="columnLine">some foreign humans who had thus settled uninvited</seg><seg type="columnLine">amongst us, action would have taken place sure and swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before this. But it was the very unusualness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, the unbelievable, astounding happening going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">right under our very noses, as it were, coupled with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">first natural interest in the strange newcomers, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had disarmed us at first and allayed any apprehension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The remarkable state of affairs was brought home</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly to the Europeans also, by the landing of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">large contingent of Andromedans on the western border</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Germany, who being aware of our perplexing prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lem, looked not with kindly eye upon their uninvited</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests. Then shortly thereafter in quick succession, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">colony settled in Spain, another in England, and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">another in southern Russia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our first enthusiastic reception and courtesies' ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended the celestial beings, now gave way to genuine</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm. The situation had become impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The President called an extraordinary session of Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gress to meet the growing danger. Pacifists were</seg><seg type="columnLine">howled down, and force was decided upon, distasteful</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it was to many.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The War Department was authorized to take whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps were necessary. Large numbers of militia and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Federal troops were called out, under the command of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Major General Bruce T. Wallace, and began concentrat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about the affected district. Artillery was massed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">close formation, forming a ring of steel about the An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dromedans; while large fleets of observation and bomb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing planes were held in readiness for action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Be it remembered that all this time the objects of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">concern were going peaceably about their business, pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing not the slightest attention to our military maneuvers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They did not seem aware of the fact that punitive action</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened them. Our newspaper men, and for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter anyone else who chose, had perfect access and</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberty to the vast city which the Andromedans were</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. They were very friendly and took every pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caution to avoid bodily injury to man or beast. Beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">their usurpations they were entirely peaceable and harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. It seemed a shame to fire upon these apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">defenseless, industrious, intelligent beings who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">busily engaged in digging canals, building immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">industries, architectural structures beautiful to behold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide streets paved with a shiny metal, and other crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of a wonderful civilization. However there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing else to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An ultimatum was delivered the Andromedans on</seg><seg type="columnLine">July 16th, 1963. It stated that where they had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled, those that were here could continue as they were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject to laws of the land; but no new immigrants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their kind would be allowed to remain; that further</seg><seg type="columnLine">encroachment on new territory was strictly forbidden;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were to pay, in a manner to be decided on</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, the full amount of the value of the land they oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupied and gun-fire would be resorted to if they dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeyed. They were given twenty-four hours to comply</seg><seg type="columnLine">with and acknowledge acceptance of the terms of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultimatum, which expired ten A. M. the following day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Interest was everywhere at fever heat. The Germans</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Russians, who by now each had a very large colony</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their own to deal with, were awaiting the outcome on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this side of the Atlantic to follow our precedent. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">one really knew what the consequences would be, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though no one doubted the ability of the military to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol the situation. The Andromedans were not warlike.</seg><seg type="columnLine">War was a thing unknown in their world. Our military</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence reported they saw not the slightest sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of offence or defense, although no doubt their</seg><seg type="columnLine">great knowledge and vast powers of industry were fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of a great deal if given time. They could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily destroyed long before they knew what it was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All civilians were ordered out of the district, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything was held in readiness for the blow-off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently the Andromedans either would not or could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand our warlike intentions, or had decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay no attention to the ultimatum. So promptly at ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock, at the expiration of the ultimatum, the military</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces let go. A terrific, overwhelming artillery fire was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid over the entire area. Overhead aerial forces drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped huge quantities of the most destructive explosives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even poison gas of the deadliest kind was liberated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous volume, in an effort to wipe out the entire area</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shortest possible time. The din could be heard for</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles and miles. It seemed nothing could remain alive. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of three hours of continuous bombardment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders were issued to cease; and reconnoitering planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew all over the affected area to see the result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They reported vast damage had been done. Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers of the Andromedans were caught in the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated fire and killed. But with a shock of amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment it was learned that their huge spheres, of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were many hundreds had not been injured in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest; and the surviving Andromedans had no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken refuge in them. These spherical space flyers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently been constructed of a material to withstand</seg><seg type="columnLine">any accidental shocks encountered in their cosmic flights;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and our mightiest gun fire and explosives had made as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much impression on their huge craft as peas would</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a concrete building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another bombardment was ordered, this time con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated on the globes, their space fliers. Suddenly these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were seen to rise into the air; and in the midst of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deafening noise, there shot forth from all their globes</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding, lightning-like flashes, accompanied by terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunderclaps--striking the massed artillery and military</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces. These lightning flashes came in a tremendously</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, flickering succession, paralyzing in their searing</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat, and striking with all the force of a million thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolts, instantly enveloped the entire countryside with</seg><seg type="columnLine">continuous white hot, explosive sheets of flame, shat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering and destroying everything, and blowing up all</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE EARTH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the ammunition and explosives gathered about. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire earth heaved and shook, as if in the grip of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">violent earthquake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The devastation caused by these electric discharges,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for such they appeared to be, is beyond description.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men and guns lay around in indescribable confusion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many who were not dead seemed paralyzed. In less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen minutes our entire artillery was completely si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenced, and of the large fleet of powerful bombers nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">all were brought down. The remaining soldiery were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered to retreat to avoid utter annihilation. A lesson</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taught us in destructiveness, the like and the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelming power of which was never before experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this planet. Horror, consternation and anger filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone's heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the terrible destruction of our military forces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their sickening loss of life, the Andromedans</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged from their fortress globes, and commenced re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">construction of their shattered area. They made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort at reprisal nor pursuit; but the way they stationed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their globes there could be no doubt that they were now</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to meet another attack very promptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE United States War Department began to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">war preparations on a gigantic scale. The General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Staff met and decided on another attack. This time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy was to be taken by surprise. All available troops</seg><seg type="columnLine">were called out and stationed in a far-flung circle far</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough removed from the affected area to avoid over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelming loss of life. After all necessary preparations</seg><seg type="columnLine">were made the attack in force was ordered. The Ninth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corps and five full divisions of the Second Mechanized</seg><seg type="columnLine">Army, stationed on the west and north, and the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">First Mechanized Army on the east, converged suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the enemy in their speeding armored cars. At the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, the main force of all-metal war planes, each carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over a hundred men, shot forward. Across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ohio River, well concealed, were ranged battery upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">battery, to intercept the enemy if they sought safety in</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight across the river. The enemy was to be given no</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparatory announcement of the impending attack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but were to be taken on all flanks completely by sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise and destroyed before they could get into action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With great speed our forces rushed forward, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked as if nothing could stop them. The orders were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill or capture every living Andromedan. Then, once</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, those terrible, flickering flashes commenced en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloping and annihilating everything. Not one armored</seg><seg type="columnLine">car or plane succeeded in getting anywhere near enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come to grips; they were burned and shattered, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">blown up by their own ammunition. Very few escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the retreat sounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other side of the Atlantic, the Germans, aided</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Belgians, on whose border the Andromedans set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled, had followed the tactics of the United States forces;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their attacking forces, too, were completely de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed. The same fate befell the Russians. Following</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard upon this, news reached the civilized world that</seg><seg type="columnLine">another colony of these unwelcome immigrants had</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed in China, near Hankow; and still others in Asia</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minor, India, Egypt and Morocco. And from all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">centers, reinforced by the constant flood of newcomers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the invaders were rapidly spreading out in all direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was now no doubt about it. This faroff</seg><seg type="columnLine">world in the remote reaches of space--the very existence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of which was unknown to us, and such an invasion</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered, if at all, as in the realm of the imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">--this far-off world, overpopulated, driven by a vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanding life-force, and possessed of the power and</seg><seg type="columnLine">means--were intent on sending their millions, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">their billions, to colonize the Earth; and if need be take</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcible possession of whatever portions they wished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The more timid among mankind counselled that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">newcomers should be left in peace, so long as they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not destructive of life. But the general opinion the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world over agreed that the situation was impossible;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that unless humanity wished to be shoved off the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it were, the invaders must be destroyed, cost what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A GREAT international council took place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">London, March 18, 1964. Things had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a state that everyone realized the mortal danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">which threatened the entire world. Every effort to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sist so far had been smothered in destruction and death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No single nation could cope with the power of the An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dromedans. All the civil, political and military leaders</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered to decide how best to grapple with the common</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy. For once all nations and peoples were united.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The instinct of preservation made the whole world kin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a solemn conclave in plenary session it was unani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mously agreed that all nations, .big and little, should each</seg><seg type="columnLine">contribute according to their power and ability, in de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fense of the common cause. An International Council</seg><seg type="columnLine">of War Ministers was formed. The supreme command</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the forces was placed in the hands of a triumvirate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed of Marshal Francois Fournel of France,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles H. Biggers, the American industrialist; and Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Friedrich Hans Goiter, Germany's great scientist. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason an industrialist and a scientist were placed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">command together with a soldier was because it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">long been recognized that in a modern war, especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a war of this kind where industrial and scientific re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sources were the deciding factors, military strategy alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not win. This was going to be no mere marching</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth, or stalemated trench warfare, such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous wars had been between members of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">human family. Naval power did not even enter into</seg><seg type="columnLine">consideration. They could not be starved out. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was needed science, industry--the artfully conceived and</seg><seg type="columnLine">executed application of tremendously destructive power</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to the end that these other-world enemies of mankind</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be destroyed utterly; or at least be forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">depart. Human civilization marshalled its forces and</seg><seg type="columnLine">girded its loins for the titanic struggle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But every effort proved futile and without avail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There seemed to be no effective way to grapple with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andromedans. Every new, every supreme effort was</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelmed again and again. And like fast-spreading,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountainous mushrooms--mushrooms with deep roots</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steel and bodies of indestructible material--the Andro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">medan cities kept growing and spreading, ever usurping</seg><seg type="columnLine">and extending--east and west, north and south--in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever widening belt clear around the world. They altered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the courses of mighty rivers; they changed the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">topography of the earth to suit the needs of their particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar civilization. Like a beautiful, yet malignant growth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they spread and covered the fair face of our good old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mother Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Extensive mine fields of the most destructive kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">were planted in belts miles wide completely around their</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">settlements. To no avail. For as soon as the Androme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dans learned of their nature, the mines were quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">blown up from a distance by their terrible lightning</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces. The explosions of these mines at times actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">aided the enemy in their operations. Deadly aerial</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombs directed from a distance by radio were tried. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">these proved more of a boomerang than anything else;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for just as soon as the Andromedans, by means of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments, located our sending stations, they dispatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleets of their invincible globes and made chaos of entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">regions. Poison gas, of a new and deadly kind, invented</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the English, was resorted to and a surprise attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">simultaneously in many places did cause large loss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life among the enemy; but after that our forces were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to get near enough to drive home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In addition to their shattering powers the Androme-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dans employed a wave length of the ultra-violet type,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">entirely mysterious to us, but which brought paralysis</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and death at a great distance to all life it touched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  New ideas, inventions, and suggestions poured in to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Great Headquarters from all over the world. Every-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing that seemed worthwhile was given serious con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sideration. Holland flooded large parts of their country</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to stop the enemy's advance, but it proved a useless sacri-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fice, for the Andromedans soon drained the flooded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">areas. In India, in northern Africa, large numbers of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">natives lost their lives in futile, fanatical charges. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Japan two entire armies were wiped out in a vain at-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tempt to save Tokio. Brave men there were and many.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But humanity simply was outclassed and overpowered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We could not cross swords with the enemy on an even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">basis. It was like fighting with bows and arrows against</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">machine guns and artillery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In desperation the high command was finally turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over to new military and naval heads for a supreme</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">effort. Enormous, frantic preparations were made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">throughout the wide world. Every Andromedan sector</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was to be stormed simultaneously with every possible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">means. It was to be a surprise attack on an epic scale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the zero hour a radio signal flashed all around the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world; and the entire forces of every nation, big and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little were hurled forward to take by storm every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stronghold, and overwhelm the invaders with one fell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swoop. The attacks were terrific. Persistently and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fiercely, with ever-mounting, staggering losses we humans</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drove on, ever on. There was no stopping, no turning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back. Savagely, desperately our attacks continued in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the very jaws of death. The heroic greatness of man,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">won with a billion deaths on countless battlefields, rose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to supreme heights. The Andromedans, if they had such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feelings at all, must have been filled with admiration for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the epic spectacle of this magnificent heroism, which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knew no let-up and defied death itself. But they had by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this time become fully aware of the determination, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">craftiness and the destructive might of us humans, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were fully prepared. They evidently expected it and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were not caught unawares. Vast numbers of soldiers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and other combatants were annihilated by their irresisti-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ble powers of destruction. All efforts were futile. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was maddening not to be able even to come to close</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quarters with the enemy--it was like hordes of savages</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">against organized steel and explosives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A GREAT and unexpected tragedy had befallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind. That such a state of affairs should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to pass seemed unbelievable. Here was the shud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dering, the humiliating spectacle of Man, hitherto the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lord of creation, bowing his head before a new master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flood of ever-arriving Andromedans spread and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread like an all-engulfing ocean, steadily, surely, relent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly. Day and night a constant stream of their space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliers dropped out of the sky, disgorged their passengers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and departed. They came by the millions. To the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">server there was something overwhelming, something</seg><seg type="columnLine">irresistibly cosmic, about it. As the Andromedans</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread, humanity was forced to recede; not east or west,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but north and south, for the conquerors were extending</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves in an ever-widening, continuous belt clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the w'orld. And as they spread, our cities and</seg><seg type="columnLine">countrysides were completely leveled and reconstructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to their own civilization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For countless ages Man had ruled the earth. Where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever he went all other forms of life receded before him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or became subject to his will. But his sovereignty over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world meant untold tragedy to the lower forms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. Not always were man's conquests peaceable or</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloodless; in fact, they were seldom that. Always, nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">always, man's cruelty to animal life, even to himself, has</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused endless suffering--often needless suffering. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">his egotism and power man lias naively taken it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">granted that all living things were placed here for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">special benefit--just given him to use as he saw fit. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortured, he slew--he ate his living contemporaries. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">his vanity he built whole religions to justify all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruelty. And this cruelty to life, although often inevi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, was not always necessary. Many harmless, inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting species that took ages upon ages to evolve in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">economic scheme of nature, man has utterly caused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">become extinct without benefit to anyone--often for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake of sport. Have the strong always been kind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">generous? What of the Mayas? The North American</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian? And what of all subject peoples?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Overnight, as it were, the conditions had suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">been reversed. The tragic spectacle of mankind, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">for ages had taken its overlordship of the earth for</seg><seg type="columnLine">granted, suddenly found itself in the same position in</seg><seg type="columnLine">relation to the Andromedans as the inferior creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">formerly bore to mankind. It is true they were spared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horrors of being eaten and used at will, as man has</seg><seg type="columnLine">done with his inferiors; for the Andromedans had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">need of man nor of the other forms of life. But ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing masses of humanity throughout the globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">found themselves homeless and poverty-stricken; forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move 011 and on, always north or south. Families of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth and influence, the rulers, the mighty of this earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">found their property and means of sustenance gone;</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually but surely forced to the level of the lowly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispossessed. Verily, a mighty nemesis had overtaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind, overwhelming and complete in its punishment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The good and the bad, the poor and the rich, the strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the weak, the just and the wicked, the arrogant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meek--all were engulfed in this consuming disaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Still the inexorable spreading of the conquerors went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on; east and west, north and south. The mighty stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their migration continued until they usurped the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the habitable globe. Human civilization groped, stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered and fell. Suicide, pestilence, hunger and exposure</seg><seg type="columnLine">took their frightful toll. Untold millions perished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the pressure of the conquerors ceased. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">avalanche had spent itself. In this most frightful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced migrations all semblance of order, all former na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional boundaries and divisions were obliterated. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE EARTH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">humanity, or what was left of it, became as one. And be</seg><seg type="columnLine">it said to the everlasting credit and honor of man--be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking the truly fine grains of gold hidden in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">make-up--that a common lot and a common suffering</seg><seg type="columnLine">united all; and heroism, generosity and self-sacrifice</seg><seg type="columnLine">were common.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A TERRIBLE pestilence had broken out amidst the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surviving masses of humanity, the vast majority</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whom were seeking to reconstruct their lives in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitherto unsettled temperate and arctic lands. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new and unknown disease, quick and fatal in its effect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The air was full of it; and in the disorganized condition</seg><seg type="columnLine">existing there seemed no effective way to combat the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cfcease. It continued to carry off larger and larger num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers till it was feared that, what the conquering Andro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">medans left undone, this fearful pestilence would com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Prominent among the doctors in Siberia, battling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this new foe that was filling man's cup of woe to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brim, was Dr. Sakaida Kawamura of Japan, formerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bacteriologist of the now destroyed Flowery Kingdom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a group of American and Russian colleagues he</seg><seg type="columnLine">labored to do what was possible in stamping out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread disease. Dr. Kawamura had been the leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">world authority on bacteriology. He finally succeeded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolating the germs of this disease. Gradually an idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed in his mind. He discussed it with his colleagues;</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrecy was enjoined. A completely worked-out plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was presented to the Council of War Ministers, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">still functioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plan was approved. As drowning men catch at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straw, so did those who kept their heads in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">supreme hour of tragedy grasp at the new idea. Through-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out untold generations, in his great trials, one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saving elements of Man has been the magic word:</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope. The idea did hold out great hope; news was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed about without revealing its nature to bolster</seg><seg type="columnLine">waning spirits and instill new courage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A secret expedition was carefully fitted out. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dangerous mission, composed solely of volunteers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all races, for it most likely meant sure death. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was carefully trained and rehearsed for his part.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To be at all successful there could be no slip-up, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy was sharply on the lookout at all times; and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was extremely difficult to get very far into their terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. The plan of action was as follow's: Several hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred planes of the new kind, capable of over six hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles an hour, were each equipped with thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small cylinders containing the active virus of the terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease--thanks to Dr. Kawamura--now under control</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as mankind was concerned. The cylinders also</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained, in addition to the virulent culture, quantities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fine steel splinters, and were made to float to ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the slightest touch would detonate them, scattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deadly messengers far and wide. The planes, sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned clear around the world, each as close as possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the largest enemy centers, were to dash forward, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lease their deadly missiles at the right moment, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treat as best as they could. Thus it was hoped that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of places these virulent germs would start in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their deadly work midst the enemy and accomplish in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their invisible might that which the most powerful means</seg><seg type="columnLine">at our command failed to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After every plane had taken its station, each manned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the pick of the world's aviators, a prearranged radio</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">signal flashed the orders to start these brave heroes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their dangerous mission. Though it probably meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">death to them, it might prove the salvation of mankind;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they departed with the fervent prayers of all hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manity for their success and safe return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time elapsed. Nothing was known of the result. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of the daring heroes returned; the rest never</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back. It was learned that thousands of the deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">messengers, in widely scattered places where the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived in greatest numbers, went home. The disease was</seg><seg type="columnLine">respiratory in its effect, and as the Andromedans were</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-breathers, unless they were far better equipped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle with it than we were--in these matters doubtful--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the epidemic should spread; and, being most violent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmer climes, might destroy the hated enemy or, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least cause vast numbers to die. But, alas for the hopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of humanity. Nothing happened. If the pestilence did</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a start, either they were more immune or their</seg><seg type="columnLine">science was capable of coping with it.

With his wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and young daughter they had fled from their native</seg><seg type="columnLine">New England home, which their forebears had settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries ago, and, gathering what meager possessions it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was possible to take, moved north, away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaded invaders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A time came when it meant sure death to remain. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, great numbers, finding the usurpers benignly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">different toward taking life, lingered on, trying their</seg><seg type="columnLine">best to live among the conquerors. But this was a diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult thing to do. For our bodily habits and manner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">living were so distasteful to them that those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingered were at first unceremoniously pushed to one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">--in such a manner as one would disregard a nest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants--and then, realizing there could be no truce between</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves and revengefully determined humanity, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">put to death those who resisted. Finally, exasperated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the tremendous and ceaseless efforts of us humans</seg><seg type="columnLine">to defend our birthright, and harrassed by our constant</seg><seg type="columnLine">incursions--for perseverance is one of the innate quali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties which formerly aided Man in world dominance--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andromedans destroyed on sight any human being</seg><seg type="columnLine">within their reach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several generations the family of Hopkins had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been of the typically inventive type, contributing</seg><seg type="columnLine">mightily to our vast industrial progress--usually with</seg><seg type="columnLine">small recompense. As is often the case, the dreamer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the inventor does not always share in the fruits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ideas; so the Hopkinses, though prolific of ideas that</seg><seg type="columnLine">enriched civilization, lived with modest means--often</seg><seg type="columnLine">even pinched for the good things of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For years Dr. Frank Hopkins had been on the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perimental laboratory staff of a great industrial firm in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pittsburgh. For a number of years before that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the faculty of a large eastern university. But, finding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the niggardly pay of the teaching profession shamefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">inadequate, he resigned in disgust and joined the labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory staff of the Pittsburgh firm. He was an indefatig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able worker; his knowledge of physical phenomena was</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">far beyond the ordinary. Many an imjiortant discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">or invention, which he always assigned to his company,</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing their huge dividends, meant but a modest in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crease in his income. However, he was frugal in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits, and, aided by an extra commission here and there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the age of fifty managed to save up a modest compet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great, all-absorbing dream of Dr. Hopkins was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the release of atamic energy. Locked tip in every grain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sand, every bit of matter, were enormous stores of</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy. which, if it could only be tapped, would revolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionize the world. For years all of Dr. Hopkins' spare</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and more, was occupied with this dazzling possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility. So absorbed did he finally become in his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream, tliat as time went on he became more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">absent-minded, and his daily work at the plant suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in consequence. It prevented the rapid promotion which</seg><seg type="columnLine">his recognized great abilities might have brought him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a kindly soul, always putting himself out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">others and beloved by all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon the inheritance of a legacy left to his wife, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">famijy came into an independent position. She under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood her scholarly, dreaming husband for what he really</seg><seg type="columnLine">was and was immensely proud of him. She loved him</seg><seg type="columnLine">dearly, forever looking to his comfort and shielding him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from petty annoyances. They decided to leave Pitts-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burgh, which they never liked, and once more took up</seg><seg type="columnLine">residence in their native town of Cambridge. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Hopkins devoted all his time to the working out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his great dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several times he had been on the very verge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">epochal discovery--a discovery that would do for civil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ization what fire did for primeval man in the dim and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten past. He knew all this. But always that all-</seg><seg type="columnLine">important detail, necessary to complete practicality,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eluded him. For hours, for days, his mind would wrestle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the problem, until weary and exhausted he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop off into slumber, from which he would waken to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take up the subject with renewed determination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the bitter day of his forced migration, with fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every heart, and the temperature hovering round zero,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he managed to take along his beloved instruments and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory equipment. He cursed the Andromedans for</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupting his researches--just when he felt that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long years of his intense efforts, combined with his pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">digious knowledge, were at last about to come to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">supreme realization. But there was no help for it; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">icy breath of death was not far away. And with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of the hunted, and the driven, which mankind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiencing in all its bitterness, Dr. Hopkins and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">little family departed in haste from their ancient home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northward in their machines loaded to capacity, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">company with fellow sufferers, they trekked their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bitter cold of winter. Whither, no one scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew--nor how it would end. Refugees from all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world crowded into north Canada, one of the havens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of refuge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In common with some of his former townsmen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">far off Manitoba--for thus far had they been driven--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Hopkins took up die loose ends of his existence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rude shelters were built; bravely the semblance of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized life was carried on. Large numbers of people</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all walks of life were crowded together, sharing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same hardships. The senseless frivolities, the stupid in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anities, which formerly loomed so large and important</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the minds of many, were now meaningless--only</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthwhile things mattered. In this great transvalua-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of all values things were where they belonged, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the true were quickly sifted out from the false.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first signs of approaching spring were hailed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">great joy and thanksgiving. The relentless pressure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Andromedans had relaxed. There was time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more Dr. Hopkins took up his long neglected</seg><seg type="columnLine">researches in quest of his beloved subject of atomic en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ergy. The profound misery of those about him only</seg><seg type="columnLine">redoubled his energy and determination to succeed. Clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a bell he saw the immense possibilities. If he suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded, a weapon could be forged whose irresistible</seg><seg type="columnLine">might should redeem all for lost humanity; would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place Man on the throne from which he had been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudely thrown. His great mind bent to the task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was a great day for mankind when his efforts met</seg><seg type="columnLine">with success. The final, elusive sides of the problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">were solved. Again and again he tested it, thoroughly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">positively--proved to himself, beyond the peradventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a doubt, that he held in his hand a new power, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finitely great, for good or evil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Frank Russell Hopkins stood before the august</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council of War Ministers--now shorn of power--dem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onstrating and explaining his tremendous discovery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With bated breath and shining eye he explained as best</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could the workings of this infinite storehouse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy, which he had solved at last through a combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of discovery, intuitive deduction and ingenious in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vention. With wide open eyes and gaping mouths, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw and understood. They saw its god-like power and</seg><seg type="columnLine">significance. Carefully planned and rightly used, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liverance could be wrung from the conquerors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The highly mathematical technical details were hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand for the layman and could scarcely be fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed even by the expert. In general, and briefly, Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hopkins had discovered a method of exciting the poten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tial energy locked within the atom, a way to break down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ordinary relations between its proton and electrons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereby releasing forces that would all but detonate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole earth, if not properly controlled. Once this ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citation of atomic energy in matter was induced, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tendency to spread with an unquenchable fierceness, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree of heat that would volatilize everything in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">path; and unless stopped would continue its steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread until the entire surface of the earth was in an all-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consuming flame. Nothing could put it out. The heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused by the release of this atomic energy would burn</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercely for months and years, burning itself out only</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the atomic energy in the surface it was attacking</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dissipated; and a diamond-hard, trancendentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy substance remained as a residue. The disintegra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion could not go far below the surface, as the free</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen in the air was a necess.-1-y part of the consuming</seg><seg type="columnLine">process.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was only one substance which was impervious</seg><seg type="columnLine">to and could confine this all-consuming energy--a chalk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like substance which Dr. Hopkins had worked out. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be easily manufactured in great quantities. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful formula had been the most difficult thing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">genius had to contend with--the doctor had tried every</seg><seg type="columnLine">known element and possible combination of elements--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its invention was perhaps the most marvelous part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the whole discovery.

So Graham walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly into the trap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">RHYTHM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To you who read this story, not having been acquainted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the two men for the long years I have, this action</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the part of my friend may seem incredible. You may</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wonder why he did not suspect anything wrong. From</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my intimate knowledge of the men, I believe I can an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swer your doubts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the first place, Graham was not of a suspicious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nature. In the second place, the invitation was so natural</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and aboveboard that it did not arouse any suspicion. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the third place, Calvroon was an inventor with 780</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">patents to his credit, and he was rather vain about it, in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his cold, reserved way. It was his regular habit, when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he had completed another device, to demonstrate it to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his step-nephew before taking out a patent and selling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the device to some firm that could use it. Several times,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in company with Graham, I had visited the combination</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">laboratory and machine-shop of Calvroon and listened to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him explain, with that curiously suppressed pride in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">every tone of his voice, the principles behind some new</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">addition to his large family of ingenious mechanical in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ventions, the details of its construction, its uses and ad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vantages over the previous machine it had rendered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">obsolete. So on this morning Graham thought merely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that his step-uncle had completed some new machine and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was ready to demonstrate it. He went over to the other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">laboratory without the faintest shadow of a suspicion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that Calvroon fully intended to kill him in cold blood in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">order to obtain those records and notes in Vault Number</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Three.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I had just finished a late breakfast and was idly won-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dering why Thornton Greene had equipped Vault</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Number Three with a key instead of the usual combina-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion lock, for it seemed to me that the latter would have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">served his purpose well, when the Atom called me on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'phone and announced that Graham was not at his lab-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">oratory, but had left a note for her saying that he had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gone to Calvroon's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Atom was immediately suspicious of Calvroon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She had never liked him. She explained that Graham</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had expected her to arrive about noon, and had left the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">note in case he hadn't returned by that time. She had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">arrived early and had found the note. Then, she told</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me, she had telephoned to Calvroon several times with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out any of her calls being answered. She was anxious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about her fianc&lt;5, and asked me to accompany her on a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">visit to the laboratory of the step-uncle to investigate. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">agreed, for I could easily detect the fear and suspicion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in her voice. I called Calvroon myself and got no answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I felt uneasy at once. Calvroon liad always impressed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me as a man who would stop at nothing to gain his ends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly it seemed quite possible to me that he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">planning to abduct and kill my friend in order to obtain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the key to life. A hard and selfish man, Calvroon. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wanted the secret all for himself. I don't think it ever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">occurred to him to ask Graham to share it with him. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he had, Graham would in all probability have refused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After I had rung the bell and knocked on the door for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more than five minutes it opened and Calvroon himself</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stepped out of his laboratory'. Seeing the Atom and me,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he inquired in a level, balanced, cold, and rigid voice,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What do you want ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I invented some plausible fiction on the spur of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I want to see Graham Greene," I stated. "An</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">important message has just arrived for him and I must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deliver it at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You're lying, Von der Konz. Besides," he added</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost hastily, ''Graham Greene is not here." He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his heel to reenter the lab. The Flaming Atom</seg><seg type="columnLine">flared up angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You're lying. He is here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Before he could stop her she had darted past him into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory. Calvroon turned silently and followed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her, trying to slam the door in my face, but I was in as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soon as he was. The Atom was throwing open a heavy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">icebox door at one end of the room, a door that was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">obviously soundproof, as was the room to which it gave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ingress. Calvroon had apparently come out of this room</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to answer the bell, and had left the door open a fraction</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of an inch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In two seconds the cold-blooded madman at my side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">produced a small derringer pistol, the type that fires those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">murderous mushroom slugs, from a cleverly concealed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sleeve holster, and shot down the Atom. She fell in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little heap in the doorway. I made an involuntary mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion toward Calvroon and found the little gun with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">big bore looking me in the eye. Calvroon's eyelids</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drooped a little as he enunciated his threat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "If you move one inch, Von der Konz, I shall kill you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I did not move. I was not armed and I had seen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enough to convince me that my captor would carry out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his threat. I permitted my hands to be bound behind me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with small but very strong metallic cords. Then I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">efficiently gagged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Calvroon's bullet had glanced off the Atom's temple,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stunning her, but inflicting only a minor flesh wound</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which bled profusely. She regained consciousness just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as the man with the gun finished binding and gagging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then Calvroon took us both into the soundproof</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Graham Greene was there, gagged and tied to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. His face was a study in despair when he caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the girl with the red blood slowly dripping from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her temple. He made one mighty but ineffectual effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to free himself. Calvroon used the gun to persuade me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to submit to being bound to another chair. Then he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kicking, struggling, gagged girl from her lover's side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bound her to a third chair. Finally he stood off and</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded the three of us with an almost puzzled ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then the three of us listened to an unusual speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Calvroon calmly announced his intention of killing us all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and then proceeded to explain to us just how he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">going to do it*in precisely the same tone as he used when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">explaining some new invention. It was that suppressed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pride in his accomplishments that caused him to tell us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his plans. Some of what he said follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "When I first decided to kill you, Greene, I realized</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that it would be best not to use any ordinary method of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inflicting death. Chemistry today is marvelously ad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vanced. Any known poison could be detected. All</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deaths by violence are strictly investigated. And I real-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ized that I would immediately be suspected because of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the terms of that will. So I devised a method of killing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you that will leave no possible clue to the manner of your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">death. When you are found in your own laboratory to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">morrow or the next day no one will suspect that you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">didn't die of simple heart failure. If they do suspect, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will never be proved, for I am going to kill you scientific-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ally without leaving the slightest evidence of that fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I have recently been working on a number of im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">provements to the pipe-organ, and I had this sound-proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">58</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">room constructed because some officials of the hospital</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">near by complained to the authorities about the various</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">noises, musical and otherwise, that I was producing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">practically all of the time. This room permitted me to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">carry on such experiments without moving my whole</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">laboratory, for the room is absolutely sound-proof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the compartment in the wall behind that lattice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">work you see at the left, which compartment extends also</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the basement, are several organ pipes which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was using a few months ago to produce very low notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">for experimental purposes, some of the notes being so</seg><seg type="columnLine">low that only vibrations were produced. This little</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch in the wall, when I throw it. will start an electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor which will compress sufficient air to play the pipes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I am only going to use one note. The organ pipes</seg><seg type="columnLine">together with an automatic device for gradually increas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the speed of the machine that plays them, constitute</seg><seg type="columnLine">the invention I call my rhythmic toy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me explain a few facts about rhythm. Why is</seg><seg type="columnLine">it that music affects a human being? Why does a snappy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid march make us feel energetic, patriotic ? W'hy does</seg><seg type="columnLine">a funeral march cause the average person to feel sad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">melancholy, and depressed? How can we explain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of syncopated jazz?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Part of the answer to these questions is in the music</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, the major or minor key, the sharps and flats, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones of the instruments. But rhythm plays by far the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater part in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The human heart has a strong tendency to beat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time with any well-marked rhythm. A rapid march has</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strongly marked rhythm that is faster than the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating of the heart. The heart increases its speed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep up with the regular boom of the big bass drum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Consequently, blood is supplied more rapidly to the brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to the muscles. As a result the body and the mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">are stimulated to increased activity by this supply of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh blood. That's why a, dance tune will set your toes</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitching. Also, the increased flow of blood removes im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">purities from the tissues more rapidly, and the person</seg><seg type="columnLine">feels more healthful and more energetic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The same thing is true of a funeral march. It too</seg><seg type="columnLine">possesses a well-marked rhythm, but in this case it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">slower than the usual beat of the heart. Involuntarily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart slows down to keep with it, and blood is sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied to the tissues more slowly. Therefore, the mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">is sad and depressed, and the body dull and lethargic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">„ "The American Indians and other savages all over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world were accustomed to hold meetings about their</seg><seg type="columnLine">campfires and chant their strangely rhythmic war songs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the accompaniment of the hollow note of the tom-tom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before starting out on the war-path. The individual who</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat the tom-tom (although he was totally ignorant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">science involved), started at about the regular beat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart and slowly but steadily increased the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the savages, their blood surging through their</seg><seg type="columnLine">arteries, had worked themselves into a frenzy of excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and courage which they did not ordinarily possess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It seems that the lower the note, the greater the effect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a band or an orchestra one does not notice the rhythm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the music of the trumpet or of the piccolo nearly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as the rhythm of the bass instruments. The drum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer sets the rhythm in a band.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The machine that will play this organ pipe will pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce short, rapid, low notes, all alike except that every</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth tone will be slightly accented. The speed will</seg><seg type="columnLine">very slowly increase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "If I started it at too great a speed, your heart could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not go with it, but instead would beat with every other</seg><seg type="columnLine">note, or every third or fourth note, as the case might be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So I shall start it at the average beat of the heart, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy five beats a minute, and it will slowly, very slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, increase in speed until five hundred or even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">short separate notes are produced a minute. But that</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed will hardly be necessary. Long before it reaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">that extreme rate your weakened heart, Greene, will give</seg><seg type="columnLine">way under the strain. You will be dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Though my actual crime will be perfectly done, I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">just now realizing that I have been grossly careless in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">preliminary matters. I have permitted you two others</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discover me with the greatest ease. I have been de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voting too much thought to the technical side of the mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter and not enough to the practical side. A failing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific mind, I suppose--the so-called one-track mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should never have been so careless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is obvious that your meddling must be rewarded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">death.

Then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will seem as if Graham Greene died of heart-failure when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he learned that his fiance had eloped with his best</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend. The shock of that double disloyalty will seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been too much for him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps it was that incredible, inhuman pride that</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompted him to brag to us of his clever way of killing</seg><seg type="columnLine">us that made us hate him the most. Or perhaps it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last part of his plan. The Flaming Atom and I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">close personal friends; futhermore we were both racing</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilots and had each distinguished himself by capturing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a world's record now and then. Because Graham Greene</seg><seg type="columnLine">was my friend and the Flaming Atom's sweetheart, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">three names were often mentioned together in the news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers. Calvroon's explanation of our presence in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed plane would have been very convincing to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">public.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Calvroon said much more which need not be added</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. We could do nothing but sit there and listen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Among other details we learned that he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the final adjustments on the machine when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atom and I had knocked on the door. He had heard us</seg><seg type="columnLine">only because he had happened to leave the door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound-proof room open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Calvroon started the device and left the room, closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy door. As near as I can judge, that was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">three or four o'clock in the afternoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For three hours, three hours that seemed as three</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand eternities, I listened to the damnable, never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceasing, steady, rhythmic, monotonous, hollow notes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever and ever came faster, but whose speed increased so</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. I knew that the blood was rushing through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">veins, but I assure you that I was not feeling either elated</seg><seg type="columnLine">or patriotic. My surplus energy was being used up by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fear that I could not conquer, by my great anxiety</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my friends, and most of all by my anger and hate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentally I cursed his soul to hell at least three trillion</seg><seg type="columnLine">times.</seg><seg type="columnLine">RHYTHM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">59</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at the end of those three terrible hours that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham's head suddenly sagged forward and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still. A strangled scream came through the Atom's gag</seg><seg type="columnLine">and great tears formed in her eyes. I looked toward my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, limp in the bonds that held him to his chair and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">swore that somehow I would revenge him. I could al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most read the Atom's eyes. In them, too, I saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">determination to get revenge. It had been such a cruel</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, her eyes told me. Calvroon had taken advantage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the weakness of his heart to kill him, had tortured him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for three hours after telling him how he was to die. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soul-sick to see the love and pity in her eyes. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were love and pity in mine too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All during those three hours the blood had been trick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling down from the wound in the Flaming Atom's temple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blood had not clotted very well. For three hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been bleeding, and the loss of blood soon weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened her. She sagged forward too, and I was glad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had fainted from loss of blood and the shock she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had endured. The rhythmic toy had no power over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. She did not hear it. I could see her bosom rise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall with her slow regular breathing. The thought came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me that perhaps her wound was to save her life, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps Calvroon had defeated his own purpose to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain extent, by shooting her. Her weary, broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart was at rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But mine was not. The unending throbbing hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">note filled the room with its reverberations. Always it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was die merest trifle faster. Though I knew that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless, I used every last ounce of nerve force and will-</seg><seg type="columnLine">power I possessed in vainly trying to control the beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my heart, trying to make it obey me and beat more</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly in spite of the rhythmic monster. I sweated blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to make my heart obey me. It can't be done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I tried to go to sleep, to outwit the rhythm that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Did you ever try to go to sleep in a room next to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a loud and never-ceasing jazz band, and lie awake hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">after hour restless and uneasy, because of its rhythm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its discords? Then perhaps you can comprehend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">merest trifle of the agony I endured, waiting for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythmic death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wondered if it were within the limits of possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Thornton Greene would return from his hiding and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive in time to avenge his son and save the lives of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atom and me, to say nothing of saving his precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret from one who had no right to it.' But that was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">last desperate forlorn hope. Thornton Greene did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back from the dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was late at night when Elmer Calvroon entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">again the sound-proof room.

Unconsciously I heard Sam and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Xenora moving about below, heard faintly the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">murmur of their conversation. At last my grim</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">forebodings of the horror that was to come were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">interrupted by Sam's cheerful hail, and I went below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I came upon Xenora in the cabin. She was arrayed in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a fresh suit of my white flannels that Sam had laid out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for her; and evidently she had been under the shower,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for drops of water still gleamed on her dark hair. She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looked freshly, incredibly beautiful, dressed even as she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I must have flushed somewhat, for she laughed at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But she showed no anger or displeasure--she had not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">resented what I had done. She looked squarely at me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with those cool violet eyes that shone with humor and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">human feeling. I read honest understanding in their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clear depths, and suddenly I went to her and held out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my hands. She took them in her slender ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently we went in together to Sam's wonderful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feast. He had the little dining room spick and span</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as usual, with the windows screened and the white lights</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">going to shut out the terrible red glare. It was very-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cool in the soft breezes from the fans, and we three sat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down in comfort to the delicacies he had prepared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sam still remembered what I had taught him, so many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">years ago, of Xenora's language, so that he was able to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">converse in it. "It'll be some revelation to the old dead-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heads at the Academy if we ever get back and publish</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">our account," he said. "They have never admitted tel-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">epathy, just because the phenomenon of thought trans-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ference depends upon such delicate attunement of minds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that it cannot be reproduced at will. Of course, we don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know just how much the radio had to do with it in your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">case. Undoubtedly it served as a carrying wave, at first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at least. But anyhow, it would be some bombshell to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">toss among my old associates!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Who cares what they think about it?" I said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We've found her. That's all that matters!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Xenora sat down eagerly. I found joy in watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eat. She manipulated her unfamiliar fork with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctive culture, and seemed to like Sam's viands im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mensely. And she ate with the restrained eagerness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who has not touched food for some time. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">misfortunes had the brave girl been through?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Presently, when she was somewhat satisfied, Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">began questioning her in an effort to find out something</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the strange world about us. "Where do your people</seg><seg type="columnLine">live?" he began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Once Lothar was an empire that girdled the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea.

And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">even they are taken to serve the Lord of Flame-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Lord of Flame! What is that?" Sam cried in</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is a dreadful thing--a serpent of green fire that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dwells in the violet mists of the chasm of Xath," she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said hastily. "But let us not speak of it. No man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speaks of the Lord of Flame, for it hears--stay! Oh,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">horror! Do you not--feel it ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And indeed, at her words, I felt a strange and alien</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thrill, as if the revealing searchlight of some dreadful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">power had been suddenly thrown upon me, as if some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strange wind of fear had blown upon my soul. I shiv-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ered involuntarily, and crouched closer to the others,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trying to drive the horror from my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God!" Sam breathed hoarsely. "What can we be</seg><seg type="columnLine">up against ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In a moment the girl went hurriedly on, as though to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">change our thoughts to other things. "Many sleeps ago</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I was taken by the men of Mutron, and put in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">power of Xath. They sent me on a ship to fight the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lunaks. We fell in with a vast number of them, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they brought the vessel down. The fire-crystal was torn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from my back in the wreck, and I was free. I ran for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the trees, but the Lunak caught me. And that was the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">last I knew, until I woke, from my dream of--of-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She turned to me with a little smile, as if such weirdly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">incredible adventures were to be taken as a matter of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">course. I could not speak for the pity and horror that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were mingled with my admiration for her courage. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I could, and did, reach under the table and take her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hand. Thereafter each of us contrived--after a fash-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ion--to eat with one hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That brief and puzzling account of her adventures</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was all that Xenora was able to give us until experience</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would enlarge our common vocabularies. Certainly it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">offered plenty of food for conjecture. She had little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scientific knowledge; and when Sam continued his ques-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions, the accounts she gave of the origin and meaning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the strange things she mentioned smacked more of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">myth than of history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Has the Lord of Flame always been, Xenora?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No," the Green Girl answered. "Back in the begin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ning, ten thousand lifetimes past, the men of Lothar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ruled, and there was no Mutron to carry them to Xath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The warriors of Lothar were very brave. They fought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Lunaks, and hunted the beasts of the plain. _ The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">kings of Lothar reigned in a hundred cities that ringed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the central sea, and there was food and joy for all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the Lunaks were very wise. When the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of Lothar brought weapons of fire to fight diem,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they went into the jungle and laid an egg, and guarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and there sprang up the Lord of Flame! It is a ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pent of green fire, as thick as a mountain and as long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a river! All the warriors of Lothar went to meet it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it slew them with a breath of fire! It took slaves of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and carried them into the fire-pit of Xath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And from that day, through countless lifetimes, our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">people have been worshipers and slaves of the Lord of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Flame. Those who are taken are no longer as men, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as sleepers walking, with the fire-crystal on tiieir backs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They fly in ships of Mutron, the City of the Sleepers,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and rule with a heavy hand in the name of the Lord of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Flame. None escape them !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'll be d--er--flabbergasted!" Sam exploded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His face was a study. Incredulous disbelief was there,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and amazement, and something of fear and horror, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">What the girl said had all the earmarks of a fairy tale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But we had seen the metal upon her body, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">purple stains--and we had felt that sudden, inexplicable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wave of fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Is it possible? Mel, it can't be! It's too fantastic!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could make no answer. "And you, Xenora. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">were taken by that thing?" I cried in sudden horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was taken in a ship, and carried to Mutron, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">City of Fear. There they fastened on me the fire-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crystal. Then my mind was in a sleep, and my limbs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">did not what I willed. Until the ship fell my life was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a nightmare of toil and terror. The Lunak took me,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and I knew nothing until you found me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Xenora still seemed rather weak and tired from her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terrible ordeal. After we had eaten, Sam and I con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ducted her over the ship, with a view to convincing her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the wonderful power of the machine and thus to quiet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her fear of that mysterious menace. We started the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">engines and moved the machine a little. I fired the gun</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for her edification, to show how the monster had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">killed, and Sam showed her how to blow the siren, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">even let her pull the cord. Then we took her back to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a stateroom, and turned it over to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she went into the room, Sam proposed that he and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I go hunting. His real object, I think, was to get some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fresh meat for the little winged plant, but we wished</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to learn as much as possible of the fauna and flora</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was not eager to leave the machine, but we were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">armed with the best of weapons, and there seemed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be little danger. Then, we intended to be gone only a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">few minutes. When we were ready to start I tapped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on Xenora's door, to tell her that we were leaving, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she made no answer. I suppose that she was already</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We climbed up on deck, and closed the hatch behind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Lost in the Purple Forest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE WALKED off east through the level green</seg><seg type="columnLine">meadows, beneath the scattered trees that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright with purple bloom. For my own part,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was much more interested in the vegetation than in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">game we might come upon. In fact, I would not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been greatly disappointed if our hunt had been in vain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The leaves of what I have called grass were really</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so wide and thick that it was hardly grass at all. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">higher stems of it bore myriads of tiny, bright-red flow-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ers. The great trees were, in shape and foliage, some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what like the oak, though the rich profusion of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">purple flowers almost concealed the leaves. They bore</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">small fruits, in appearance a little like the date, which,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as we were later to learn, were edible. But, in all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the time I was in that strange world, I found 110 single</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plant that was exactly like any I had known above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Indeed that was a strange hunt, under a flaming scar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> let sky, nine miles beneath the ocean, through forests</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of the purple trees that burdened the air with their un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> familiar fragrance, in search of we knew not what in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the way of game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN GIRL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We tramped steadily eastward over the green mead-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ows for perhaps.half an hour, rewarded with the sight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of no living thing. The Omnimobile had long been out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of sight. We crossed a low greasy ridge and made our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way out across another broad smooth valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At last, as we looked from a screen of brush at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">edge of a little meadow, we saw an odd-looking creature</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gazing unalarmed a hundred yards away. It was some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what larger than a hog, with gray, hairless skin and long</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white tusks or horns. It had an oddly heavy, barrel-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It must have winded us, for it threw up its head with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar squeal, tossing its great tusks. Sam and I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">both fired. We have never agreed which of us hit it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but it slumped over on the green vegetation. We hur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ried up to it. It was quite dead. It had great claws,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and somewhat resembled a sloth, although it was exactly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like nothing that I had ever seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sam took out his knife and skilfully removed half of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the skin, wrapping up a piece of meat in it. The beast</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had thick rolls of fat along the back, but the flesh be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">neath looked so nice and tender that he took some of it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to try for steak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We'll try some of it broiled when we get back," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">anticipated, smacking his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Let s hurry on," I said. "We've been gone longer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than I intended, already. What if Xenora wakes up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and we're not there ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Let s see, Sam said doubtfully. "The wind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the south, wasn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I looked around in sudden panic. I was almost sure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that I knew the way back to the machine--almost!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The strange world about us was suddenly very alien</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and cruel. The plains were lonely and flat and dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1 he trees were suddenly wild and mysterious, as if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they concealed strange monsters. There was a ghastly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unearthly menace in the red gleam of the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In all directions the tountry looked much the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was no definite landmark. We stood there for a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time, scanning the unfamiliar panorama, in the begin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ning of panic. There were half a dozen groups of trees,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any of which might have been the one from which we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fired. It occurred to me that it would be very incon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">venient if one of the flying plants came along, and I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">began to think of other things that might happen. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came to a tardy realization of our helplessness and utter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ignorance of the dangers that might surround us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The purple trees and the scarlet sky seemed to leer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at us, to gather closer, to laugh in fiendish joy at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unnamable doom they might have in store for us. Un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">consciously I drew my pistol, and my muscles were in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">voluntarily tensed, so that I started when Sam spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Of course we can see the wall of cliffs in the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">That will give us the general direction. If we can get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up 011 that hill, we might be able to see the machine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He pointed toward a round, bare, green hilltop that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rose several hundred feet toward the red sky. It was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perhaps^ mile away, in the direction of the hazy blue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cliffs. He slung the piece of meat over his shoulder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and we set out over the open field. It was very hot and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the perspiration was dripping from us. I had hardly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">noticed the damp, hot wind before, but now it felt like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a blast from a furnace. The intense scarlet radiation of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the flaming sky dried up our energy. The steady beam</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ot heat brought over us a growing languor, a depressed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and spiritless weariness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The whole weird region was very still. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds were the soft sighing of the wind in the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the thrashing and rustling of our feet in the rank</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass. The tiny scarlet flowers danced before the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost like little insects, and a few brilliant petals blew</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes from one of the sparsely scattered trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  . Phew!" Sam whistled, stopping to mop his brow</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the huge red bandanna he had tied around his neck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'This is beginning to feel like the Sahara! I'm glad I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't happen to be a native of the place! You bet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine will look good, when we find it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   If we find it," I could not refrain from saying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   In five minutes more we were far up the side of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little hill. The side of the eminence was bare of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great flowering trees, so the strange forest lay about us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">southward for many miles. Eagerly we looked in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">direction that should have been southwest, for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Omnimobile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   A vast stretch of the rolling plateau lay before our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eyes, low verdant hills, and vast green meadows, scat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tered with the brilliant purple trees, singly and in groves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Far away, all across the southern horizon, stretched the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">black sea on which we had landed, glancing with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crimson light of the sky. But nowhere, in all that vast</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strange expanse, did we catch a glimpse of the machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      must be just in a low' place," Sam said hopefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Or, I think I remember now that there was a little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grove just north of it. We will see it in a minute, if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we climb higher up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "I hope so," I said, raising my binoculars for a better</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And we have compasses and instruments to guide</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them !"CS ar°U'Kl ^ W°rld' ** We'd J'USt thou-"ht to bri'V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It s no use!" I said. "Let's go on to the top."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIX</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Hill of Horror</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        CLIMBED up the last few yards to the sum-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mit, and gazed across toward the dim blue cliffs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that rimmed this world on the north. We stood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on a great divide. A vast valley lay before us, stretching</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">away until it was veiled with a faint rosy haze. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">curious checkered expanse of green plain and purple</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woodland sloped far, far away to the north. Perhaps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">twenty miles away was the vague outline of a great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">silver lake, dyed with the light of the crimson sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Just back of the lake seemed to be a shore of low</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">black cliffs. And beyond those ragged peaks, and be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">neath the towering and rugged columns of blue that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">threw themselves up to the bloody sky, was a strange</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sight indeed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was a weird flicker of dancing lights in that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">far-flung crimson mist, as if it reflected strange infernal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fires in a pit behind the low black wall. There were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">faint and moving gleams of violet--of pale violet flames</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that changed and rose and fell. Vague tongues of violet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fire wove themselves throughout that distant rose-colored</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mist, with a writhing, rhythmic motion. They formed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">curious shapes of flame, that faded strangely and came</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But my description is futile. The important thing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was not what we saw, but what we felt! A curi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ously unpleasant sensation of helplessness, and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strange horror, came over me. I felt as if I were steal-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing a forbidden glimpse of an ancient and incredible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hell! Fear swept over me--alien, inconceivable terror-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like a keen and bitter wind that numbed my brain! I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">felt the horror of a sentient force, utterly inhuman,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">devoid of all human knowledge or understanding, as cold</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and remote as the frozen night of space!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was terrible--an intangible aura of fear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out of that pit and tugged at our souls with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">icy hand of stark horror! I can give the world no con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception of the overwhelming terror of it ! Nor would</seg><seg type="columnLine">I if I could, for such things are better forgotten. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped my rifle and clenched my hands, trembling. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">braced my feet as though against the force of a physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind that was striving to carry me toward that abyss</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nebulous horror-light!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I looked at Sam. He stood very still, leaning back,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with hands raised and jaw dropped. In his eyes was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the look of the fresh and innocent soul that struggles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a pitiless terror that it cannot know or understand!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Such a look I had never seen before--and God grant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that I may never see it again!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  My gaze was drawn irresistibly back into that mantle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of moving light. Even as I watched, a pillar of green</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flame, very bright and broad, thrust itself up through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the wavering mist of violet fire, and into the crimson</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">haze. It was like the slender head of some obscene green</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reptile. It reached up---incredibly! It writhed and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">twisted about! It was like a great serpent of fire. And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it saw us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It grew still with awful attention. Eternities seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to pass as the dreadful thing hung there, motionless, like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a vast frozen pillar of twisted emerald flame, like a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">column of curdled green fire, with curious throbbing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">changes in its brightness. I felt a weird force flowing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out of it. And I knew that it was watching us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" Sam muttered. "My God!" I looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him again. His thin face was very white, and beaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with perspiration. He was mechanically mopping at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead with the red handkerchief, and staring at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist of flame with the glaze of terror upon his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I struggled mightily to throw off the spell of amaze-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment and terror--of alien and unutterable horror--that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was grasping at my mind. It was a heart-breaking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">effort. I moved. I seized Sam's arm and shook it. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swayed drunkenly, with his eyes still on the awful lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was like one in a trance--like a man in a dream of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">death!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And I felt those icy fingers of unthinkable doom clos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing about my own mind. I was paralyzed again, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my eyes drawn back to the north. The snake's head of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">frozen green still throbbed strangely, and the flickering</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">violet aurora still kept up its storm of varying motion,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the dim rosy haze into which the awful head was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lifted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Something was reaching toward us, out of the pit!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I knew there was intelligence in it--a will, inhuman, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unthinkably strong! It was calling us, compelling us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I knew that in a few moments we could fight no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Suddenly a low sobbing sound reached us on that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  warm, humid south wind, a sound that wailed uncer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  tainly behind us, and rose to a piercing shriek, and slowly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  died away into the distant south, echoing weirdly on hills</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  and trees as it rolled and sank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sam started with a hoarse cry, and went off down the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hill toward the north at a stumbling run--toward that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">abyss of alien horror! A moment more I struggled des-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perately, but that pitiless power overwhelmed me! I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">followed in his tracks!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And then, a clear rich voice reached me from beyond</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the hill--a shout in Xenora's rich and ringing tones. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had a clear human overtone of confidence and courage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Come back, Melvin Dane! Come back, Sam!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The old scientist stopped uncertainly, passing his hand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dazedly before his brow. Abruptly the terror was gone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from my mind! The love and the courage of the brave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">girl flowed into me. And suddenly, with the green light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">still pulsing through it, as though sent by a mighty heart,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the terrible thing in the north dimmed slowly and faded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">away! Still the violet lances flickered through the rosy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mist, but the green thing was gone--and we were free!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I took Sam's hand, and we turned our backs on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">amazing play of fire above the incredible pit, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hastened to the trees from which Xenora's voice had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemed to come. We reached the little grove, but I did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not see the girl. Suddenly I had the persuasion that I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had not actually heard her with my ears, after all!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Xenora! Xenora! Are you here?" I called un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sam was still trembling and mopping at his forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"She wasn't really here, I think, Mel," lie presently said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a strained voice. "She must have reached us with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">telepathy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For a long time then we stood there under the flower-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing trees--very close together, feeling all the awftil mys-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tery of the strange world about us--and thinking of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What was it?" My silent lips at last formed the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " 'The Lord of Flame!' Xenora said. 'The Lord of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Flame!' 'A serpent of green fire that dwells in Xath</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">below Mutron!' " Sam repeated mechanically. "I would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to God I knew what it is!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what was that awful sound?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That was the siren of die Omnimobile, I think. You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know we showed Xenora how to operate it. Probably</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that saved us, by attracting our minds from the Thing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">while Xenora reached us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then if we go toward it-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the instant the wild, sobbing shriek rose again, very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">welcome for all the wailing qualities of its tones. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a moment we were hastening down the green hillside</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">among the purple trees, in the direction from which the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sound had come. Twice we heard it again. And in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">half an hour we saw the glint of the silver metal side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the machine beyond a thicket of purple bloom!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I have seen few more welcome sights than the Omni-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mobile was then. The heaviness of it, the threatening</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nose of the little gun, the air of irresistible power about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it, and even its clumsy, beast-like appearance were reas-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suring. Sam gave a cheer, and we made the last hun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dred yards at a run. At last we stumbled up the metal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ladder and stood upon the narrow deck again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We clambered through the manhole. The white elec-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tric light of the interior was in strange contrast to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crimson gloom, and the coolness of the air was very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">refreshing. Xenora was in the cabin, anxiously on her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "It was the Lord of Flame!" she whispered. "And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  you escaped!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Thanks to you, my dream girl," I said, taking her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  boldly in my arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN GIRL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XX</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam's Pet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I FELT it watching you--calling you--and I pulled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the cord that makes the great cry," Xenora whis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pered, after a long, long time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God you did ! It saved us! We were lost 1"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I told her of the amazing storm of flames, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thing that had risen out of them, and of the irresistible</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell of terror, from which she had awakened us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," she said. "It was the Lord of Flame. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">watches the world from Xath. He knows the acts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">every man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I must have reeled a little with fatigue, for suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl looked at me with quick sympathy brimming in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes. "But you--my white prince of dreams--you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are very tired. You must rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Abruptly I realized that I was tired, dead with fatigue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an unutterable weariness not only of body but of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, for the horror had exhausted my emotions. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Sam splashing water under the shower. I fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him to the bathroom, and then went to my bunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the stern, for I had given Xenora my stateroom. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was leaden with weariness, but peacefully secure in. the</seg><seg type="columnLine">protection of the heavy metal walls of the Omnimobile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I have very little idea how long I slept, for we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">let our watches run down. In the absence of the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we came to pay less and less attention to the time, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">we usually kept the chronometers going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I woke I felt greatly refreshed, with my ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rorized despair almost gone. But I would not forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sense of evil and intelligent power that I had got</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the pillar of strange green fire that had been thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">so deliberately and purposefully up through the mist of</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet flame, and into the rosy haze that hung over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden abyss in which it lurked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had seen us! I knew it. And I knew that, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">if its incredible power seemed withdrawn, it was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">not far away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard Sam speak, heard Xenora laugh. Evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were in the little galley, for I heard the clatter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooking utensils. I dressed and went in. How beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful the girl was! Her red lips were brilliant against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light green tan of her skin. Her dark hair fell over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders in a rich cascade, and her violet eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkling with life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She came to me quickly, and took my hand. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">words passed between us, for our minds were too near</seg><seg type="columnLine">together to need many words. It was enough for me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the sympathy and love in her eyes. And it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, when our hands met, that a subtle current flowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth between us, setting our minds alight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making our hearts beat faster, raising us together into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a higher ethereal plane and fusing our beings into one 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In a moment Sam, with a kind smile of understanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his face, called us to the table. The steak from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing we had killed was a great success, and the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">was loaded with the good things with which the larder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the machine was stocked. The girl ate heartily, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">did Sam and I, and we talked and laughed a good deal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even if the small number of our common experiences</seg><seg type="columnLine">limited the topics of conversation, we had a merry</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough time of it, and somehow that happy meal gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">us greater courage to meet the strange menace that rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After we had eaten, and all had helped wash the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dishes, all in the same gay spirit, Sam got out the box</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he had put the little creature he had named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alexander. I had quite forgotten all about the diminu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive winged plant. With mingled curiosity and repul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion I watched him unfasten the box. I had not yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovered from my instinctive horror at sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying plants. Xenora seemed to share my antipathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them. But Sam has always seemed to care as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much for wild life as for men; and he seemed to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider the little creature as natural a pet as a dog. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, of course, his real reason for keeping it was for</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific observation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The thing fluttered about in the box when he picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it up, and as soon as the lid was raised, it flew out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit on his hand. Already it seemed bigger and stronger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than it had been a day before. The pale yellow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little fish-like body was darkening. The wings seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a darker green, and stronger. The blood-color of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender tentacles along the sides of the body was growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper and deeper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The weird little monster clung to his finger with</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of its tentacles, holding the thin, petal-like mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">branes about its head extended, and moving its black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knobbed organs restlessly. At first the color of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flower-like tissues was almost white, but when I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden motion, they quickly darkened to a deep violet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the little creature crouched down in Sam's hand as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it were alarmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sam smiled down at it with real understanding in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  H« uncovered on the table a dish containing a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">chunk of the raw, bloody meat of the thing we had killed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The queer, flower-like head twisted about, and the black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalked organs moved like eyes. Abruptly the membrane</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed color again, from the violet of its fright to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sam held his hand over the meat and the slender ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacles disengaged themselves and writhed down over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate like tiny red snakes. They began to suck the juices</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the meat, and, as the thing filled itself, the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">flower slowly faded in color, until it was a pale pink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Observing my instinctive horror of the thing, Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">said: "That's the way it was meant to eat, Mel. Noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing unnatural about it. Our table manners might not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem very elegant to an angel 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I guess you're right. But that thing just gets on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my nerves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When he went to put the little creature back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, it clung to his finger as if reluctant to go, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange bright patterns of color flashed over the thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">membrane. It seems fantastic enough, but even then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sure that the little thing possessed intelligence, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was beginning to feel affection for Sam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The next time he took it out it seemed larger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger--and hungrier! We stayed there for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been ten days, though we kept no accurate</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of time. It grew rather astonishingly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">always its odd appearance of intelligence was greater.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed to feel a real affection for Sam. He whistled</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient tunes to it sometimes, and it seemed to listen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in great delight. And for long hours he would sit with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing in his lap and talk to it. »He declared that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was getting so that it could understand. Bright colors</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled on the membranous fringe, and it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen to him with great intentness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                                                      &lt;r</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Back to the Haunted Hill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON THE morning--if one may speak of morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that world of eternal day--after we had slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the fatigue of our visit to the hill where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen the lights of terror, Sam took me aside for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mel," he said, "we can't forget what we've come here</seg><seg type="columnLine">for! My generator is still keeping up the interference</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ether; but, sooner or later, the force we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to fight--and it must be that 'Lord of Flame' of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xenora's, and the thing we saw from the hill--will</seg><seg type="columnLine">break down the interference!

There's plenty of room in here for us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live our lives out. I've been thinking about it--and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded sympathetically. "I know, Mel. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">means a lot to you. But perhaps we will win and save</seg><seg type="columnLine">our lives, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a chance!" I said bitterly. "Not against that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing we saw! It means death--or worse! But I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose we have to go on and do our best!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man was beaming. He patted me on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. "I knew you would be with me, when you had</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to think," he said. "Now, when the life of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world is at issue, we can't consider ourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think we can do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What can't we do?

Not there! It was only a miracle--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xenora--that saved us before!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've some theories. We'll be better prepared next</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden thought struck me. "Say, couldn't we pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flying visit to our own world again, and tell what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we've found ? Then the world would still have a chance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'hen we are--gone. A half-million Americans, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks and heavy artillery, would look mighty good down</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. And it would just take a day or two to go."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No," Sam said. "The world would hardly believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all, even if we carried out what evidence we could.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And nothing could be done in time. Then, I'm not sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could get out. In fact, I'm pretty sure we couldn't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rockets might carry us three miles high, all right;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we could never break through that water from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath. We would fall back. Mel, it's up to us!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">During the days that followed, Sam spent most of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours in the little laboratory. He spent much time on</seg><seg type="columnLine">those great machines that controlled his forces in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ether. And he invented and developed another device</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was more nearly within my understanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know, Mel," he said one day, "I think I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">rig up something to protect us from that--fear--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came so near getting us. Ever since you made your</seg><seg type="columnLine">telepathic contact with the Green Girl, I have had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea that the brain sets up disturbances in the ether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">We know that the action of the nervous system is elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trical in nature, and all electric discharges set up ether</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves. It happened that you and she had great minds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">created in perfect synchronism, so that each was sensi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive to the vibrations of the other. Hypnotism is best</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained by such electric theories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, I am convinced that the 'Lord of Flame'</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a brain--whether in a human body or not I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to say. It creates such powerful etheric dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbances that it was able to affect us at a distance. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is the case, it ought to be a fairly simple matter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">provide insulation against its vibrations. You know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">induction or electric action cannot penetrate a conduct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cage. I ought to be able to fix a conducting helmet</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will prevent the induction of neuronic currents in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our brains."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A short time after he showed me three helmets, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">called them. They were little more than bags of wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">gauze to be put over our heads. He demonstrated that an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electroscope draped with one of them remained entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaffected by charges brought near it; but it seemed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridiculously inadequate protection against that terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We went hunting several times, for the benefit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little plant. After the first few days, Sam let it go</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, hanging on his coat. It was growing very fast, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">developing remarkable characteristics. It showed sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prising intelligence. Sam seemed to have a real affec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion for it, and it, in turn, seemed to love him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I never ceased to feel the strangeness of those expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions over the rolling green grasslands, among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparsely scattered flowering trees, in the hot damp air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the intense red light. We shot two more animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the first, and three others of a smaller variety, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat resembled large rabbits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very shortly after Sam had perfected his electro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen helmets, he planned another expedition to the hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we had so nearly met incredible disaster. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried a telescope, electrometers, spectroscope, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few pieces of Sam's recently developed and highly com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicated apparatus, which he had neglected to name, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">detecting and analyzing etheric waves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Xenora insisted on going with us, and there seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no reason for leaving her behind, since Sam had perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence in the efficacy of his new helmets, and since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl herself was an excellent woodsman, and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">undertake to keep us from getting lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had a long hot march of it across the green plateau</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the purple trees, with the fierce beams of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson sky pouring down upon us. Burdened with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy instruments, we were worn out when we reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the summit. I had suggested that we come in the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine, but Sam wanted to keep it out of the sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weird enemy we fought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more we gazed across the vast valley of purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">and green, to the mists of ruby light over that abyss be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the distant lake, in which the violet beams still</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced and pulsed. And hardly did we have our ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus set up when we saw that unearthly, serpent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like beam of green fire writhe up out of the vale of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery into the rosy haze!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had on the insulating shields, and I felt nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the inexplicable horror of the former occasion;</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, of course, the whole adventure was certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible enough. But now that strange thing of green</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed distant and devoid of menace. By way of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment, I ventured to raise my helmet. The terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN GIRL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">caught me like a cold and rushing torrent that swept me</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost off my feet 1 I was glad enough to get the wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">gauze fastened back about my head again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is the Lord of Flame," Xenora cried, "looking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over toward the city of my people, to see who will be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taken to become his slaves. This is a wonderful thing,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Barsoni Sam, that lets us not feel its power!''--Barsoni</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">being a word that means 'great man,' in the tongue of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lothar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For many minutes the amazing shape of twisting</seg><seg type="columnLine">green radiance hung in the air. Sam was busy with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus, squinting at the thing through telescope and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectroscopc, and reading his other devices. At last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful, throbbing thing faded away, and died into noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingness. Only the violet lances were left in the mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Many of my theories were substantiated," Sam in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">formed me, almost jubilant. "And I got a lot of new</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">data! It is rather odd, but the light from that thing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shows the helium lines as luminous bands, not as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dark lines that might be expected to rise from the ab-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sorption of the helium in this atmosphere! I can hardly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">understand it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He said nothing more, but was sunk deep in thought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as we quickly gathered the instruments and hastened</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">silently down the hill. I felt that he had won a notable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">victory in the invention of the thought-insulating hel-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mets. We arrived at the machine again without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">accident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Silver Sphere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR several days longer, Sam continued his labors</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the laboratory. During that time "Alexander,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flying plant, developed remarkably. Before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved, it had a wing-spread of two or three feet. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have spoken of its intelligence. It soon learned to flutter</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the guns when we were preparing to hunt. Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked to it incessantly, and declared that it could un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand him. He said it could even make its thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">known by the varying pattern of colors on its fringe</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brilliant membrane. Presently he had it trained to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry dishes and to do other similar tasks in the galley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Of course the thing never learned to speak. In fact,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it was devoid of vocal organs, and incapable of making</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a sound, though its hearing seemed to be good enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It appeared to communicate its emotions and thoughts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by means of changes of color in the tissue-like mem-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brane that I have termed a flower. And, from a strictly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scientific point of view, communication by light, or sight,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is quite as logical as communication by sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sam examined the black, rod-like organs projecting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the flower on the thing, and said that each of them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bore thousands of tiny eyes, like the compound eyes of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an insect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After we had been in the vicinity for perhaps two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weeks by upper world time, we started the Omnimo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bile's great motors again, and moved northward. I had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not told Xenora about my talk with Sam--our minds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were too closely attuned to require much conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I knew that she understood that our maneuver would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">probably mean our sacrifice to the cause of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She said nothing of it, but I thought I detected a sadness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in her manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">During all the hours that Sam had been in his labora-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tory, alone or with Alexander, I had spent most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time with Xenora. We wandered together about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meadows, or sat in the cabin to escape the almost intol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erable heat. Always I loved her more, brimming as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was with humor and sympathy and love. And bitterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">I cursed the fate that was dragging us both to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Even at the beginning, Sam's scientific achievements</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had been so far above my understanding, that I would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scarcely comprehend them, and his later speculations</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">regarding the menace of the abyss were so abstruse that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I quite failed to follow them. His little workshop for-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ward was crammed with strange machinery-, some of it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">humming incessantly. Indeed, his apparatus was still</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">keeping up the interference that prevented the freezing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the earth!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sam had been signally unsuccessful in getting any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scientific information from Xenora, for the simple</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reason that she had none to impart. But, from her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">geographical knowledge, he attempted to draw a map,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">showing the locations of Lothar, of Mutron, and of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pit of the Lord of Flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It seemed that there was a strip a score of miles in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">width between the farther blue walls of the abyss and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the great lake we had seen. The pit of Xath seemed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be a great crater lying in that strip. On the brink of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crater Xenora located her "City of the Sleepers," or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mutron. The domain of the last city of Lothar, where</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she had spent her childhood, lay along the cliffs far to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the west of there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Our boldest plan of action would have been to hurl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the machine, by means of the rocket tubes, into the abyss</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a direct attack on the Lord of Flame; but Sam, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reasons he did not divulge, doubted the success of such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a maneuver. He wished to keep up his researches, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">possibly to visit the city of Lothar. His apparatus told</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him that hidden forces were again stirring in the ether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For ten hours we moved toward the north, making a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long detour to westward to keep within a valley, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">always trying to take advantage of such cover as was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">offered by the purple trees. The country was, for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">most part, rolling and green, with the great flowering</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trees dotting the hills and plains but sparsely. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blazing radiation of the eternal crimson day was un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">diminished, but the temperature fell slightly with in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">creased altitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Xenora and I were together at the cabin control-board,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">driving the machine; and Sam was in the conning-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tower, with the little gun, ready for emergencies. When</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we had been moving for some ten hours, we mounted a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">low, bare hill, and saw in the little green valley before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us a thicker forest of the bright purple trees, offering</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">good cover for the machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We had crossed the summit, and I had increased the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speed to ten miles per hour in haste to reach the trees,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in spite of Sam's fear that the operation of the motors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at anything like full capacity would create a disturbance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the ether that our hidden enemies would pick up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Suddenly I saw a strange thing skimming along over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the bright forest before us--in our direction! It looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like a bright silver globe, many feet in diameter! It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">floated a few hundred feet above the trees, drifting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">smoothly along like a bright metal balloon in a very swift</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wind. There was no visible propulsive mechanism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shouted a warning to Sam through the speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube, to stand by his little gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">-68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Xenora laid a light hand on my shoulder and said,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a tense voice: "It is the Sleepers of Mutron, the slaves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Lord of Flame! They will fight to death--they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know not fear!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As the silver sphere drifted swiftly and silently down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon us, as though borne by an invisible wind, twice I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">caught a glimpse of a slender ray of purple flame, that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">darted out of it and moved searchingly over the bare</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">greensward below. And then a rich purple beam fell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suddenly and intensely upon the Omnimobile!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When that misty finger of purple light discovered us,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I saw a strange vortex of pale green fire spring up about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the globe and reach out in our direction. Suddenly I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">realized that this ship was of the same appearance as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weird thing that had destroyed our cottage! Small hope,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I thought, if that force of atomic disintegration were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to be released again!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I heard the rapid crashing of the machine gun, as Sam</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">began to fire, and presently bursts of smoke appeared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about the gleaming sphere. But to hit a relatively small</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and rapidly moving target even a mile away is no mean</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feat of marksmanship. I drove rapidly for the purple</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wood, but with little hope of getting there before the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terrible red disintegration had melted us away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Suddenly I heard the drone of some of Sam's new</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">machinery going into action. He had mounted his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">switches and dials in the conning-tower, so he could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">control it from where he stood. Vivid blue electric flame</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quivered and flashed over the metal parts of the machine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as his new weapons went into play!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The floating globe of silver drifted nearer, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">misty vortex of green fire about us grew more intense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A strange red glow stole over the vegetation around us,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and a solitary purple tree ahead burst into crimson flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then the sparkling fingers of purple fire reached out at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us again from the sphere. I wondered vaguely why the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strange force was not acting upon us. I did not know,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">until it was all over, that Sam's vacuum tubes had set</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up a repulsive screen in the ether, protecting us from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the electronic vortex!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Abruptly an intensely bright, blinding tongue of white</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flame leapt toward the silver thing from the great plat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inum electrode on the nose of the Omnimobile! Sam</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had turned loose his electric arc! The flame struck the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">globe, impinging upon it like a jet of fire, converting it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into a ball of supernal light!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then it fell! It plunged toward the forest in a gleam-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing curve! The green vortex of the disintegrator ray</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was gone, and the purple fingers shone no longer! The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">incandescent shell crashed out of sight beyond the purple</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trees!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Green Slaves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">SAM snapped off the arc as the silver ship fell, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the drumming of the generators stopped. For a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little time the world was very still. Xenora stood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tense and silent beside me. As I turned toward her, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">caught the slight perfume of her dark hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Indeed, the Green Girl was a beautiful being! The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white flannels she wore failed to conceal the delectable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">curves of her slight and boyish figure. Her rich, red</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lips were parted slightly, in the unconscious intensity of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her outward gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Abruptly she became conscious of my look, and turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to face me, with a quick smile on her face. There was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a radiant, joyous light in her eyes. The soft green tint</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of her skin was obscured by the rich, warm flush of her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">excitement, and she smiled with gladness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Impulsively she reached her slender hand out to take</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mine. "You have won, Melvin Dane!" her soft voice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said. "The ship of Mutron is fallen! We shall not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be slaves of the Lord of Flame! We shall not die the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">violet death in the pit of Xath!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope not, my Xenora," I said. "I hope-" and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I stopped in a little confusion. I was not really em-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">barrassed, but I could not go on. Really, talking to a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">princess like Xenora is quite a different tiling from mak-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing protestations of love to a being of one's dreams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What is it that you hope?" she said quickly, with an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">impish smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sam saved me by coming in from the turret, begrimed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the smoke of the little cannon. He was a won-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">derful man. He was still strong, erect, and confident,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">despite the load of toil and hardship our adventure was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">putting upon his seventy years. His white hair was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tousled, and he was cheerfully loading up his ancient</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pipe, as calmly as if he were in his own kitchen in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Florida.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Looks like the arc did for 'em all right," he said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">briskly. "Suppose we get over and take a look. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">might pick up something new."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Very well," I assented, and turned to start the mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tors. I could not resist a grin at Xenora, who was still</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">regarding me with a speculative smile. She laughed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back at me; then was suddenly serious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Be careful! The Sleepers of Mutron! They might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be alive in the wreck! As long as they breathe, the Lord</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Flame rules them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I started the generators, and the Omnimobile rolled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heavily down across the green slope, and through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fringe of flaming purple trees. In a few minutes we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came upon the wreck of the silver car, a great tangle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of twisted wreckage, half fused by the electricity, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bent and torn by the fall. It lay in the little open space,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a great tree splintered and smoking under it, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ground about empurpled with fallen petals. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">twisted metal plates gleamed brightly in the light of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scarlet sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I stopped the Omnimobile, and we got out and ap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">proached the wrecked machine. There was a vast mass</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the debris. The globe must have been forty feet in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">diameter. We spent several minutes in gazing at it from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">different angles, and then $am and I climbed into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tangle of bent white plates and massive twisted girders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The machinery had been too completely destroyed for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us to be sure just how it worked. But Sam thought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the shell had carried tanks of water, the gravity of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which had been negatived by the emanations from tanks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the same luminous gas which supported the roof of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">waters, lifting the ship. From the nature of the frag-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ments of electrical machinery we observed, it seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the horizontal propulsion was attained by the ion-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ization and repulsion of the helium atoms in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The apparatus that had produced the atomic disintegra-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion was too badly wrecked to be identified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Presently I came upon the body of a man, caught</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">between two twisted bars, and cut half in two. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">body was naked. It had a greenish cast that was darker</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by far than that of Xenora's fair skin. The physique,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN GIRL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and the size and shape of the head, showed a race of</seg><seg type="columnLine">high intellectual development.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dead man had a metal frame clamped upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. It was twisted and broken, and whatever had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been fastened upon his body had been torn away in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crash. And the corpse had upon its back the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet stains that had been upon Xenora when we found</seg><seg type="columnLine">her 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Sam found another body. It had been half</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned up by the arc. It, too, had the metal frame upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and the thing the frame was to hold was still clamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it! The body bore, fastened to the back with those</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel metal clamps, a six-sided bar of blue metal! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was six inches in diameter and two feet long!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This must be the thing Xenora calls a 'fire crystal,' "</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam said, "though I don't see any fire about it. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned queer!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Do you suppose there is machinery in the bar, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">generates forces or currents that move the man about</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a puppet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Might be. I don't know. The metal thing may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a receiver for the occult force set up in the ether by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord of Flame--hypnotism by radio, perhaps, or some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of the kind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Anyhow, as you said, it's damned queer, like every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else we've found here--excepting Xenora."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Suppose we take the thing along, and open it up</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we have time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He produced a pair of pliers, and we twisted the odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue bar out of its frame, and carried it to the machine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was oddly light to be metal, though it must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">an irksome burden to the one on which it was fastened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We got aboard again, and moved for the cover of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple wood, for we did not know how soon relief would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come for the fallen ship. But Xenora assured us that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Lunaks, as she called the flying things, quite fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently destroyed the ships of Mutron, and that the fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this one would be laid to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Blue Prism</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR perhaps thirty miles we drove the great ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine through the brilliant 'forest, southward down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broad valley. At last we stopped in a little grove</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tall flowering trees, close by the cool crystal stream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond the grove was a little patch of green clearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the great purple trees closing in all about it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a peaceful spot, weirdly beautiful, and it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure enough. The unceasing wind was not so hot be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the great trees, and they shielded us from the burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, crimson glare of the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Omnimobile seemed safely hidden beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of purple bloom; and whenever we were tired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or thought ourselves in danger, we could retire to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet security of its cool interior, behind the thick metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. Frankly, I hoped that our stay there would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long one. I tried to forget the menace that hung over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our life there was simple, and, for my part, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supremely happy. Or not quite supremely, for I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not quite still my conscience. I was pretty well resigned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fate, however. With such a girl as Xenora, a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be supremely happy anywhere. We tramped to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether about the grove, gathered the tiny, bright-red</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers in the green meadows, and bathed in the cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark pools, where the river flowed beneath the purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. Sometimes she sang to me the folk-songs of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, monuments of the high estate that Lothar had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once enjoyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What would it matter to me if the eternal death came</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and forever to the upper earth? What would it</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter if the earth did freeze? I forgot in the idyllic</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness of Xenora's companionship--or tried to for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get. If the roof of water were changed to ice it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">only be more secure! The maiden and I could live out</seg><seg type="columnLine">our lives in this strange land, without regard to the fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world. One of her matchless smiles, or a note</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her golden laughter, was worth more than all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile, Sam was immersed in his laboratory work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the examination of the prism of blue metal, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his curious pet. The plant creature still grew with re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable speed, and always showed most remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence. It was always with Sam, flapping along</seg><seg type="columnLine">above him on broad green wings, or walking awkwardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon its thickening red tentacles. Sam gazed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickering colors of the membranes about the head, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light of strange understanding in his eyes, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange gestures with his hands. Just to what extent</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could communicate, I never knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It always went with him, when he went to hunt for its</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat. It was a voracious eater, requiring a kill a day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The great sloth-like animals were plentiful and sluggish;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not difficult to stalk them. As soon as it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong enough, the plant creature learned to carry Sam's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle. Its extraordinary intelligence, or imitative instinct,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is shown by the fact that one day it fired the gun itself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it was flying with the weapon, and saw one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloths on the run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It showed a very real affection for Sam. Once, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were out together, it saved his life. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuskers had suddenly charged him from behind, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature flew at it and attacked it madly with its un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed claws. At the cost of considerable minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">injury to itself, it held the beast off until Sam could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a shot. It always showed an odd delight at his ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resses, and seemed to take a peculiar joy in the music</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his old phonograph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I have said, it grew very quickly. At the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stopped in the wood, it was somewhat smaller than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hawk. Perhaps two months later (time was rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaningless to us during that one happy period of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventures in that world of unending day) the creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grown so large that once, in an apparently playful</seg><seg type="columnLine">mood, it was able to lift Sam and fly with him on a cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuit of a hundred yards, bringing him back to the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine and setting him down very softly. Then its</seg><seg type="columnLine">armored brown body was as large as a man, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green wings were like sails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was near the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During all that period, Sam devoted much time to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">examination of that bar of strangely light, bright blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal. He felt that in it he might find a solution to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mystery of the Lord of Flame. I assisted him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as I could. The metal was evidently an alloy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Analysis showed that it consisted largely of aluminum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a trace of a heavy metal that we could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">identify. And the bar was slightly, very slightly, radio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">active--perhaps, Sam thought, merely because it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been exposed to intense radium emanations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The density of the bar was only half that of alumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">num. For some time we could not understand that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Careful examination showed no break in the surface;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently we sawed it in two, and then in many</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces, searching for the machinery that we half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to find. But, as far as we could determine, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar was absolutely homogeneous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Sam thought of examining it under the micro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope. He found that it was full of microscopic bub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles--hollow places! By later experiment, we found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the metal was just a sponge of the strange alloy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with tiny bubbles of helium gas, under considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure. Sam presently formulated the theory that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alloy, when formed, had contained considerable amounts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of radium compounds; and that the alpha particles, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged helium atoms, thrown off by the disintegration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the radium, while the metal was in a semi-plastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">state, had been imprisoned in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was not until later--much later--that we got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the true meaning of it--that we understood the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidious force that acted in the metal, to make human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings slaves to it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the days went by--happy, carefree days for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew real joy for the first time in my life. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth I had known the Green Girl in my fancy. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to find her, with a restless, hopeless longing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left me discontented and unhappy, whatever my sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings. Now, at last, she was really mine. I loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">her with a singleness and intensity of affection that</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned all my emotion in one direction, so I felt little</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear or care for anything else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  One day, when we sat like children together on a cool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moss-covered rock beneath a great fragrant purple tree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a crystal pool before us, gleaming like molten ruby</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the light of the scarlet sky, I told her quite simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I loved her--that I had known her always, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved her as long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The white chieftain of my dreams," she whispered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"for what long years I have wished for you to come and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no need for further words between us. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a long, long time before we returned to the machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then I am afraid we both flushed a little before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile of tender understanding on Sam's lean face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Tragedy in the Purple Wood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUR woodland life was happy. We were quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious of the events that were shaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to bring sudden catastrophe. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw in our simple lives no foreshadowing of the supreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments of the stupendous drama in which we were in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volved. The crisis came with little enough warning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the last day of our joyous existence there (we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen into the habit of making an arbitrary division</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our time into days and nights), Sam arose and fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">our breakfast. I remember that we had pancakes, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">maple sirup. Then, since "Alexander" was fluttering</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, eager for the day's hunt, and flickering messages</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him with its petal-like membrane, he got his rifle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they departed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the old scientist walked off through the purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, puffing steadily on the old pipe in his mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fondly watching the huge, winged beast that flew along</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">above him with his gun, little did I dream of the tragedy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was in store! I could not have believed that Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in any great danger. The winged creature that</seg><seg type="columnLine">attended him was two-thirds grown; it would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a match for a couple of lions 1 Certainly it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no feeble bodyguard!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour after he had gone, Xenora and I took one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my old romances of science, and walked a quarter of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile up the limpid stream to a favorite resort of ours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We laughed and talked much by the way, and gathered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great bunch of the little red blooms. I was teaching her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to read--at least that was our nominal business, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was usually forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The living, wonderful mystery of her, her sheer per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fection, the life and love that sparkled in her eyes, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">enchanted me, carried my thoughts away from the page!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We sat together on our mossy stone seat, reading a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, and laughing and talking much, until we forgot all</seg><seg type="columnLine">except each other. When I looked at my watch, I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had been there many hours. We got up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started back to the machine, speculating light-heartedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on what Sam would have ready for dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We shouted carefree greetings as we approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, and received no reply. We got to the deck, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended to the cabin in vague alarm, but saw no sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old scientist. We hoped that he had only been</seg><seg type="columnLine">delayed. I blew the siren several times, and listened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear a signal from his gun. But when the echoes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast had died away from the silent purple wood, all was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still again. We heard no answering shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I climbed out on the deck to listen. Not a sound dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed the stillness, save the faint rustle of the unceasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind in the purple trees above, and the crystal tinkle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little stream. Green meadows and bright trees lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaming beneath the hot red sky--quiet as death. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stillness was ominous. It bore the portent of doom!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Xenora crept up by me and ran her strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool arm through mine. Her violet eyes were solemn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now; and her fair face was clouded with anxiety. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to share my love for Sam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am afraid for him," she whispered. "Many things</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have happened. The beasts he hunted may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged and killed him. Or a ship of Mutron may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">found him--the ships of the Lord of Flame travel even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the waters of the lower sea to do battle with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lunaks. And there is another danger of the wood--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is never seen. The hunters of Lothar never venture far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the city."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her words were not particularly encouraging, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made ready to go to look for Sam at once. I carried a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle, my pistol, and an emergency medicine kit. Xenora</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted on going along, and I could do nothing but assent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not wish to leave her alone, and she herself was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean woodsman. In fact, when it came to the matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">following the trail over the low green plants, she proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">far more expert than myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We left at once. The trail led us east for a mile, par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">allel to the stream, in the cover of the purple trees. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it turned north across an open meadow; and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xenora picked up the spoor of one of the great sloths,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Sam had stalked. It led on to a group of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant purple trees, and there we found two fired catridges</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Sam's rifle. Three hundred yards farther on, in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">open meadow, we found the kill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alexander had evidently had his fill from it; and near</seg><seg type="columnLine">by were the dying embers of a fire, and the charred green</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN GIRL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stick on which Sam had cooked a steak for himself. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground around the fire was somewhat tom up. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">green plants had been uprooted and crushed. And there</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground I found another cartridge from the rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently Xenora picked up a trail leading toward a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clump of the flowering trees to the north. We followed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it hastily, silent with fearful anticipations. Twice we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saw on the ground great splashes of green liquid, of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">life-fluid of the plant creatures. Had Sam's pet been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fighting for him in the air as he fled ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then we came to the pitiful end of the trail. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ground was frightfully torn up, as if great bodies had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">struggled there. There were great splotches of the green</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fluid, and a fateful stain--evidently of human blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sam's battered pith helmet we found on the ground there,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and six fired shells--silent tokens of the battle!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  From the spot no trail led away. There was no evi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dence to show whether the battle had ended in death or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in capture, nor anything to show what manner of being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the unknown assailant had been. For a long time we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stood there, gazing at the spot in lifeless grief and de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spair, apathetically fingering the helmet and shells, vainly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trying to picture the contest, and looking about for other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">signs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is no use to go farther," Xenora said at last. "It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is the unknown menace of the purple wood. Many a man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Lothar has been taken by it--it is a silent, wineed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">death!"	K</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXVI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Last City of Lothar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">PRESENTLY we turned and trudged wearily back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the Omnimobile. There was nothing else to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I was sick with an aching heart. It was incredible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that Sam, kind and true friend that he had always been,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should be no more. A choking lump rose in my throat,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and I confess that a few tears rolled down my cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But I still had Xenora. As we walked, I put my arms</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around her, protectingly, in the grim determination that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this strange world should not rob me also of the dream</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">girl for whom I had searched two worlds. My love of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her kept me from utter despair, but even then I knew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that our ideal life could not go on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I would have to find what it was that had taken Sam--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to identify the thing that Xenora called so vaguely "the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">menace of the purple wood." Might it be the wild plant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">monsters, or was it something even more alien and ter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rible? And I thought more seriously of the danger to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the earth, that I had been trying so vainly to forget.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sam's responsibility had fallen on my shoulders. I must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">see what I could do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With the wonderful intuitive knowledge of one an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other s thoughts that Xenora and I have always had, she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">understood what was passing in my mind before I said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">anything. Softly, she took my fingers in her hand, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looked at me with deep sympathy in her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I know, Melvin, what you think. And it is right. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is hard, so soon after you have come here to find me--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but it must be. I can guide you to the city pf my people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I can even show you to the brink of the pit of Xath,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if you would go there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You are very brave and true, my princess!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I come from Lothar! If you feel that your duty bids</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you risk the violet death in Xath, I would not dissuade</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you. But the Lord of Flame is mighty--no man can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fight him! He has power over all!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Except our love," I said. I stopped, and took her in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my arms, and pressed her red warm lips against my own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In the whole world, she was all that was mine. She clung</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to me fiercely, as if the terrible power of the pit of flames</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was trying to tear her away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At last we went on, and presently we reached the Omni-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mobile, hidden in the purple grove. In Sam's absence, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looked very cheerless and lonely. We got aboard and made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ready for departure. I tuned up the motors, and exam-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ined the electric weapons, and cleaned and loaded the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little cannon again. As I worked, Xenora went in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">galley and fixed a lunch. We ate quickly, under the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">silent pall of bitter tragedy, thinking of the smiling old</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man that should have been with us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then we climbed into the conning-tower, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched on the engines. The humming of the genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors rose again, and the great machine lumbered clumsily</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the little wood, where it had been hidden for so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many happy days. For many hours we held a north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">westward course over the green plateaus and through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple woodlands, with the light of the crimson day shin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the ports.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Xenora stood by me and chose the route. For the last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">few miles we crept along just east of a high, bare ridge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of rocks. At last she bade me stop the machine in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clump of trees at the foot of the hill. The last city of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lothar, she said, lay but a mile beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I took my binoculars and a rifle, and we left the ma-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chine and clambered up a half mile to the top of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ridge. The girl led the way, slipping cautiously through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the rocks. At last she threw herself down behind a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fringe of the low green plants, and motioned me to crawl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up beside her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Look," she whispered, "and see all that is left of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lothar, the proud kingdom of my fathers, under the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">curse of the Lord of Flame!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Indeed it was a scene of ruined grandeur that met my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eyes. A little valley, perhaps two miles wide, lay beyond</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ridge on which we were concealed. On the low hill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beyond, standing out against the crimson sky, was a mas-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sive ruined wall. Back of it rose the crumbling desolate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ruins of great towers and palaces of stone, covered with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the moss of centuries of decay--merely the bare bleached</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">skull of a dead civilization!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It was in those fallen palaces of my fathers," Xenora</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whispered again, "that I found the strange machine that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brought me the first dream of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">_ I Put UP the glasses and made out the actual city out-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side the wall. Certainly Lothar had fallen since its days</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of radio. There was a mere straggling village of rude</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stone huts spread out on the valley floor, below the colos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sal ruined metropolis. The few hundred buildings were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by a little cleared space, with the purple for-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">est creeping up to reclaim it forever. I made out a few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">children playing about the trees, and a dozen ill-clad men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">working in the clearings. A few wreaths of smoke</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">curled up from the dwellings; the peole had not yet lost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the art of fire!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And hanging silent and menacing in the air above the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">village was the visible symbol of the alien power that had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wrecked that ancient civilization! A great, gleaming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">silver ball--a ship like the one we had fought--hung mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tionless above the huts, with a quick purple beam from it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flickering frequently over them!</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time we lay there watching that desolate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitiful scene, and then Xenora touched my arms, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped back down the ridge. She was silent, with grief</seg><seg type="columnLine">and despair in her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See!" she whispered at last. "See! Lothar is dead!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Lord of Flame has killed it! The men are poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling wretches; they could do nothing even if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame were gone! My father was the last king of Lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thar. His was a troubled reign, and he has been dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">many hundred sleeps!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't grieve so, my princess," I said. "There are</seg><seg type="columnLine">still vast cities above the waters, where men are power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful and wise, and where the' sky is blue and a white sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">shines, and where there is a domain many times larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than all this abyss!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can we go there--ever ?" she questioned eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. We can never leave this land, even if the Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Flame is killed. The machine cannot break through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof of water from below. And the power of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord of Flame is coming to earth. Even now it may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dead and frozen world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And drooping in the silence of dull despair, we reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine, and drove quickly for the protection of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper wood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXVII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mutron of the Sleepers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR half a dozen hours we lumbered eastward</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the forest. We wallowed through swamps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rolled over broad green meadows alight with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crimson day, and broke through jungles bright with</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple bloom. At last we emerged on a narrow upland,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the great lake below it. The black sheet of water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinged with the red light of the sky, stretched away for</seg><seg type="columnLine">many miles to the eastward. Along its northern shore we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the low cliffs that divided it from the pit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stopped the machine, and looked for a long time</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the black lake to the north, and over the low cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ruby mist beyond, alive with the dancing violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I turned to the rare girl beside me, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching me with tears brimming in her violet eyes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter grief, the black despair 011 her face half broke my</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolution. I felt doubtful, weak, utterly miserable, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain stabbing at my heart like a thin steel blade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is right. You must go," she whispered bravely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took her in my arms again. How wonderful and true</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was! Struggling so bravely to hold back her tears!</seg><seg type="columnLine">More precious than ever in the final parting! A single</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour of the heaven of that embrace--embittered by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge that it would soon be ended!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, quickly, lest my resolution fail, I made ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure! I stretched up a tent in a little grove above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake, and stocked it with a liberal assortment of sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies from our store-room. I gave Xenora an automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a case of ammunition, and showed her how to use the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon. Here she was to stay, in the vain hope that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might return a victor from the mad attack on the Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For I had determined to enter the abyss. I knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was what Sam would have me do, rather than lose time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an attempt to learn his fate. Xenora was eager to cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lot with mine, but I would not hear of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A choking lump was in my throat as I staggered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the Omnimobile, and closed the manhole with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling hand. I gave a final heartbreaking glance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the splendid girl, majestic and erect, even in her pain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing desolate and alone by the tent. Then I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the generators, and drove north along the lake shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had the rude map that Sam had drawn from Xen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ora's knowledge. It showed the pit of the Lord of Flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be just north of the lake, separated from it only by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprisingly narrow wall of cliffs which, the girl said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a highway of her fathers, though it was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with jungle. And the city of Mutron was shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">north of me, 011 the brink of the pit of Xath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steadily I drove northward, in a daze of fevered pain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seems an eternity when I look back upon it, but it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have been many hours. Automatically I kept in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter of the purple trees. At last I emerged on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of a great plateau, covered with the green vegeta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, many miles across. On the south and west, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">whence I had come, it was surrounded by purple trees--</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the thick purple wood in which I had halted. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north the great cliffs towered up to the sharp-edged scar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let roof, four miles above. It was strange to see the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls cut off so abruptly by the red. The sky was like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">red lake seen inverted in a mirror. Those blue cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hardly a dozen miles away now--I had to bend back</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head to see the sharp line where the roof cut them</seg><seg type="columnLine">off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the east side of that plateau, there was--nothing!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond, lay the pit of Xath, with the faint ruby mist</seg><seg type="columnLine">above it, filled as always with the wavering reflections of</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet flames.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as weird, as unearthly, as a dead city of the moon!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had the silent, ghostly gleam of moonlight! It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped in mystery, clad in frozen fear!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the city was not idle.

What, indeed, could I, with my puny ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine, do against the great science that that city of mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery represented? The men of one once mighty empire</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now slaves to it!

Only a thin green line separated the abyss from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake on the south, which, in the reflected light of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarlet sky, horribly suggested a sea of blood, ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">flow into the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Undoubtedly the crater was of volcanic origin.

I drove the machine mechanic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, lost in a daze of grief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For ages, it seemed, I shot forward through the haze.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last I made out a bare floor of sand and rocks, pitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with circular craters. It was a good thousand feet be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, and still dim in the haze. I opened the bow tubes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the force of my fall was checked. In three minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, the machine struck the earth, bow first. It tore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast hole in the sand, and rolled over twice, coming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest on its side. Fortunately it had been built to with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand such knocks; fortunately, too, I was strapped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my cushioned seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I got the motors started and worked the machine to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">upright position.

That intense violet light, from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flickering reflections came, and from which the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam reached up, I knew, must be the seat of the Lord of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flame!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I started the engines once more, and the machine rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">mightily forward over the bare rocks, with a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">clangor of metal upon stone, forging ahead at last to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alien menace. It roared over bare sandy flats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded great boulders, crashed into pits, crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">through craters! Then, suddenly, that terrible green</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame flared out toward me! I knew that I had been dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered ! Like a lance of green flame it flashed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red gloom above! Its motion was alert, surprised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I set the loading mechanism of the little gun to fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">high explosive, and put it in action, hurling shells in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of that violet light. And still I drove swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. The flashes of the explosions were visible through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mist ahead, but the deep violet light still glowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned on the reserve power units, and the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrated from their throbbing drone. I threw another</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch, and the deep purr of the giant transformers filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship. The mighty white tongue of the electric arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out ahead of me!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the Omnimobile plunged on!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two of the silver spheres--the ships of Mutron--ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared before me, with the green vortexes of the atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">disintegration springing up about them.

I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shells were bursting near it, and that the arc would</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach it soon.

It was scores of feet thick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hundreds tall! It was a vast smooth cylinder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet fire! It shone like metal, which was white hot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen through violet glass! The color of it ran and flick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered on the surface! Violet sheets and bands crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flashed upon it, and violet flame flowed away from it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in many little tongues. The thing was perfectly smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cylindrical, five hundred feet in height--a Titanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">"monolith" of metal!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still the Omnimobile lumbered irresistibly onward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The little gun crashed regularly, and the shells threw up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth about that weird cylinder half a mile ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the great white flame of the arc was playing far out</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it like the sword of the angel of death!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw a cluster of curious gleaming machines about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the great cylinder.

I made a wild attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to swing the machine around it. But, busy with the arc,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the generators, and the gun, I had seen it too late. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">brink loomed before me! Desperately I set the brakes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The machine paused jerkily, hesitated, then leaped over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rim! For a breathless second it fell down the sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater wall! I had no time to use the rockets! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed heavily upon the rocks!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was torn from my seat and flung cruelly against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the conning tower! My helmet was knocked off!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And on the instant, a red storm of fear broke about me!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It beat down on my brain like a rain of horror! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbed with an archaic rhythm, stirring strange emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions that overruled my reason and volition! Terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept about me like a fierce wind from a hot desert of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, picking up my soul and sweeping it away to a fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnamable!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I struggled with it terribly, with all my will.

I was still an independent entity, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat apart and watched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew that I had succumbed to the hypnotic control of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alien power that dwelt in that vast metal cylinder.

My body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no longer my own! It was swept along as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a mighty wind. That force of horror roared and</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbed in my brain. Red flames of fear flickered be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore my eyes. I was sick and faint with terror. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">my body did not collapse--it was relentlessly moved by</seg><seg type="columnLine">that terrible force from the violet cylinder. I was utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless--I felt the hopeless horror of one chained</seg><seg type="columnLine">before a loathsome monster!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly I wished fiercely for death, for only death</seg><seg type="columnLine">could bring me freedom from the horror that swept in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbing torrent through my brain. But even death was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond my reach, for my hands were not my own!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment that power left me standing on the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the overturned machine. The Omnimobile lay on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sandy floor of the crater, which may have been a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet in depth and as many yards across. Against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red sky, above the black cliffs of the pit's farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">rim, towered the violet metal cylinder--the flaming metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain whose hypnotic control ruled my body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment I was left standing there, and then my</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was springing down and running across the rock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strewn sand toward the cliffs.

In a few moments it reached the rim. It clam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered wildly up. I know that in my normal self I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have surmounted that sheer wall. But the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathic force from the flaming brain seemed to give my</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs superhuman strength! Soon I was at the top,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bleeding hands and tattered clothing!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And my body ran on toward the violet monostyle!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was two hundred yards away--a Titanic smooth up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right cylinder of metal, the polished surface crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flowing with violet flame, with the great incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">serpent-like beam of green rising from the top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was astounding--in the strangeness of its aspect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in its inexplicable suggestion of alien intelligence!</seg><seg type="columnLine">But how could there be intelligence in metal ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then I saw the men about it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two of the vast silver spheres were stopped on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground below the cylinder, oddly dwarfed by its vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">height.

They were parts of it--akin to it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men moved like sleepers, or like machines, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that I was moving--as if their wills were dead!</seg><seg type="columnLine">They toiled in tireless haste, without confusion. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">were carrying burdens. And it seemed that some were</seg><seg type="columnLine">polishing the surface of the cylinder, or applying some</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous substance to it. Near the ground they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite plainly visible, clinging to its surface like flies, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">toiling furiously. Higher up on the colossal cylinder they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were but dancing black specks within the violet flame!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ground about was pitted with shell holes from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombardment, and at one side I saw the twisted wreck</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great machine I had struck.

Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of fear that had seized my body permitted it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop, and I stood still. That awful twisting beam of</seg><seg type="columnLine">green flame reached out of the top of the thing, and bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">down over me! It touched me!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt tiny whip-like fingers of it feeling--exploring</seg><seg type="columnLine">my body!

But that horror held them open!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that green fire came into my body, and into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain.

It sought to know of me, and of my com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions, of the Omnimobile, and of the world we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left above. I struggled against it, fiercely, terribly, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt my limbs chilling with the sweat of the conflict.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it won!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took my mind as it had taken my body! It beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">about my brain like a vast storm; it penetrated my being</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a flood of green fire! My brain reeled, was swept by</seg><seg type="columnLine">an avalanche of awful power!

I felt as if I had toiled as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I slept, as if I had answered many questions put to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">by that power.

With a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick motion, before I could prevent her, Xenora had</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped the electro-screen helmet from her head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn it about my own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fly," she whispered fiercely. "The Sleepers of Mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tron ! And think not of me! Fly!

I ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">after her, calling for her to take back the precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet.	'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly she stopped. A convulsion ran through her</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame. She turned, with her face a mask of livid hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror. She was in the power of the Flame! She was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleeper! She bent, seized a rock, and hurled it at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head with superhuman strength. I dodged and it hurtled</seg><seg type="columnLine">past my ear. She sprang at me like an animal, drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunting knife I had left her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned and ran wildly, as a score of the Sleepers</seg><seg type="columnLine">came running. I passed close by that violet metal mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ostyle, and it seemed that its crawling violet fires reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for me. I ran desperately toward the east! I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange cries of the Sleepers of Mutron behind me!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt the awful green flame writhing above me, but even</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could not penetrate the helmet!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was insane with terror!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I ran on and on, through eternities of heart-breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort. At last I stopped exhausted, with pounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">temples and bursting lungs, to look behind me. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming brain was but a dull violet glow against the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. A desolate waste of bare rugged rocks and great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">round craters lay about me beneath the crimson mist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All was silent! The sounds of pursuit were gone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Nitrate Plantation"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHOULD I go on, or return and try to save Xenora,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she had rescued me? That question throbbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my brain. The answer would have been easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough if I had had her alone to consider. I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerfully have surrendered myself to that dreaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">power to save her--any man would have done as much!</seg><seg type="columnLine">But what of the menace to the earth? Should I give</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the struggle?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time I stood there on the rim of a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater, lost in indecision. At last my sense of duty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind was victor. I set off wearily toward the east</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. The Omnimobile was so near the flaming brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I dared not attempt to reach it, even if I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">confident of finding it. And upon consideration, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that if the machine was left as it was, it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">only as a trap for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sorry hope, indeed, was I for victory in the struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that vast alien power for the safety of earth!</seg><seg type="columnLine">A man alone, ragged, without even a pocket-knife, lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wilderness of a strange world, and possessing only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a modicum of scientific knowledge!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What folly, indeed, for one in such circumstances to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit himself against such a science! But that seemed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only hope for victory. With Sam in my place, the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">look would have been brighter. If I had a fair scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">education, Sam knew enough to raise cities and armies</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wilderness!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For many hours I struggled toward the east--away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the violet glow--over the desert of rocks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">craters, through the ruby mist. And I came unexpect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly upon an explanation for the origin of the crimson</seg><seg type="columnLine">haze. Thin clouds of red luminous gas were hissing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some of the craters or funaroles--escaping from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the radium deposits in the core of the earth, to float</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and augment the radioactive cloud that held up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was half dead with weariness when I reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile-high cliffs at the crater's rim, and half insane with</seg><seg type="columnLine">grief for Xenora, and with angry doubt of my wisdom</seg><seg type="columnLine">in deserting her. I have little memory of how I got up</seg><seg type="columnLine">that wall of rocks. I remember climbing until I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn out, of toiling upward with bleeding hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, of fighting on when I was dizzy for want of food</seg><seg type="columnLine">and water, of struggling up when my body screamed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain for me to surrender and drop to merciful oblivion</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the abyss! I remember sleeping many times on ledges</seg><seg type="columnLine">or in crevices when I could go no farther.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at last I reached the rim!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I climbed out upon the flat plateau to the east of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">abyss, a strange wilderness of green plains and purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, but infinitely welcome after the tortures through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had been. I stumbled across the meadows until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found a little stream. Eagerly I wet my parched</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, and presently I slaked my thirst, and ate a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the date-like fruits of the flowering trees. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a period of many months thereafter, I led a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange wild life--the life of a beast or a savage. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">now seems to me that I must have been more than half</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">insane, yet I had cunning of a sort. Wandering about</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the woodland in the first few days, before my strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fully recovered, I came upon a great lump of native</seg><seg type="columnLine">copper. With hammer and anvil of stone I set out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape some tools of it. First I made a knife, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broad blade for a wooden spear. With those weapons I</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon had stalked and killed one of the great fat sloths.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After several weary efforts, I achieved a fire by friction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feasted upon roasted meat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many were the mad and impossible schemes that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fevered brain formed for making an attack on the flam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing brain of metal, only to reject each upon considera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. As I had hurtled through the air above the pit, in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill-starred attack in the Omnimobile, I had been much</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressed by the narrowness of the bridge of cliffs be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the great lake and the abyss. Now it occurred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that I might dig a canal, and let the waters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake in to flood the Lord of Flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that in mind, I made an expedition to the isth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mus, armed with copper pick and spade. I found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes had curiously deceived me, from the air. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">land bridge was a wall of rock, nowhere less than a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet high and four hundred thick, covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rank growth of jungle. Along it, even as Xenora had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, was a ruined road. Here and there a crumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone monument rose from the jungle like a bleached</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull of the dead civilization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no hope of digging a canal. A hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, in ten years, might have been able to cut a tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">through that wall of stone, with modern tools and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosives! Nitroglycerine! That started me on a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of thought. I had once made chemistry a hobby. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not impossible. For Sam, it would have been child's</seg><seg type="columnLine">play. But, alas! there was no help from my old friend!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I set to work at once. For many months I labored.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The task was a tremendous one. The first necessity was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an adequate supply of nitrates. I was not fortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to discover a natural deposit, as heroes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiction usually are; so I set out to make a "nitrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">plantation" such as is used for the manufacture of ni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trates in a primitive way. I dug a great shallow pit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined it with waterproof clay, and filled it with alternate</seg><seg type="columnLine">layers of wood ashes obtained by burning the purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, and everything I could pick up in the way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitrogenous animal and vegetable refuse. At last it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled and wet down with water from my clay-bed. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had nothing to do but wait until the nitrogen products</seg><seg type="columnLine">of decomposition had united themselves with the potas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sium bases in the wood ashes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I fell to the mining of iron pyrites, and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building of a furnace in which I could burn my pottery</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus. After many disheartening failures I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to set up apparatus that I thought would suffice for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manufacture of my acids. I burned rude jars, glazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sand, in which to carry and store my reagents and</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My memory of all that time is a dim dream of terror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many times for long hours I stood on the brink, gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the flickering mist, thinking of Xenora and half</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined to give it all up and to seek her. But always</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went back to my mad task, toiling in a daze of grief</seg><seg type="columnLine">and despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before I did anything more in the way of manufac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, I paid another visit to the isthmus, and selected</seg><seg type="columnLine">the site for the mine which was to tear an opening in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found a deep crevice in the rocks, and spent many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks in clearing and enlarging it, until I had ready a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber deep in the heart of the barrier, below the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During all that time I lived upon the little fruits and</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the flesh of the sloths I killed. I carefully saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fat from the latter, saponified it with alkalies leached</seg><seg type="columnLine">from wood ashes, and removed the soap by "salting</seg><seg type="columnLine">down" with evaporated brine from a salt spring. I col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected and stored the glycerine until I had many gallons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, judging that my "nitrate plantation" had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to serve its purpose, I dug it up, leached the prod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uct, and crystallized the saltpeter by evaporation in</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthen pots. The yield was satisfactory in quantity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fair in quality, but it had cost fearful effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I set about the manufacture of sulphuric acid</seg><seg type="columnLine">by roasting the iron pyrites with nitrate in my crude</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus, collecting the acid in wet pottery condensers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That took many days, and the next step was making</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitric acid by boiling saltpeter in sulphuric acid and</seg><seg type="columnLine">condensing the fumes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, when I had the three necessary chemicals--</seg><seg type="columnLine">glycerine, and nitric and sulphuric acids--I set out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">transport them separately to my mine, to avoid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazard of the transportation of the finished product.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That, again, was a heartbreaking task, for I had mate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rials enough to make several hundred quarts of nitro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glycerine, and the distance was half a dozen miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But ragged, ill-kept savage that I was, I had collected</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the cliffs above my shaft the materials for the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ufacture of a good quantity of high explosive. For one</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my position, it had been a considerable achievement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXXI</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Mine on the Brink</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AT LAST, in haste and fear and trembling, I began</seg><seg type="columnLine">the task of mixing my chemicals, dumping them</seg><seg type="columnLine">■*- into vats of water cooled by evaporation, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rude shed to cut off the fierce heat of the red sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even with all my precautions to prevent a premature</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion, the hazard was fearful. I washed the nitro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glycerine, and carried it in earthen jars down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of the cliffs. I meant to die in the final explosion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I was afraid the stuff would go off before it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But finally I got the last of the rough jars into posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Then I closed the mouth of the chamber with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks and rubbish, to be sure that the full force of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion would be exerted upon the cliff. I lit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuse I had prepared--a tall candle of the sloth's fat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, burning low, would ignite a powder train; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would set off a charge of gunpowder I had placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the jars of nitroglycerine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew that, if my terrible months of toil had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in vain, a few hours more would see a raging torrent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water rushing into the pit. At last I judged my task</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed. I walked a few yards north to the rim. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on the brink of that sheer precipice, and gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the rosy mist, alight, as always, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavering, reflected fires of the metal brain. I made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to get beyond the range of the explosion. Plope</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dead. Life meant no more to me. I was ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be swept into the abyss on the crest of the wave that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if my plans went well, would drown the flaming brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time I stood there waiting, lost in dreams</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREEN GIRL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In a strange semblance to military order they flew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like fleets of battle-planes . . .

And then a flight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them swept downward again, and I saw Sam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted on one . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of Xenora. I had no doubt that she was dead. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">regret was bitter; I stormed vainly and passionately</seg><seg type="columnLine">at fate. If my reason had been tottering, now it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost gone. I wept, and cursed, and then laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud and bitterly. A strange figure I must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been, wild and unkempt, red and burned from ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posure, half naked, with insanity in my eyes, laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and waiting to be blown to my doom!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then I heard a sound that brought me into</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent and cunning alertness! I sprang to the mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my shaft and crouched like a savage w'ith my</seg><seg type="columnLine">great copper-bladed spear at hand. I heard a stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">78</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rattling and crashing down into the abyss! Someone--</seg><seg type="columnLine">or something--was climbing up out of the pit! I crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward where I could see, and lay tense and silent, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate madman, determined to protect my mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">against whatever might find it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last a human figure clambered up over the brink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew itself erect in the edge of the jungle! It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Sleeper of Mutron! The emaciated form was bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the weight of the bar of gleaming violet metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamped upon its back. It was clad in tattered, bloody</seg><seg type="columnLine">rags. The flesh was bleeding from the fearful climb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the dull, mechanical motions of a sleeping per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, or of a walking corpse, galvanized by some weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, that terrible figure got deliberately to its feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bloody hands raised a long, glittering weapon of</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver metal. And it plodded dully, lifelessly, toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. And then a hoarse, wild cry echoed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent jungle--my own scream!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Sleeper was Xenora!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With her old intuition of my thoughts, she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to penetrate my helmet!

She walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on toward me, with the same weary, mechanical gait.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no light, no life in her eyes. They stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight ahead, dully, unseeing! And the strange silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube was held ready in her hand. She was more like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving corpse--a dead avenger--than a living person!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A mad storm of desires arose in my brain. How I</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to spring up, to take that dear body in my arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to minister to its hurts, to have the Green Girl for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own again! It took all my will to hold me in my hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. But this was not Xenora! It was a Sleeper of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mutron, a slave of the Lord of Flame!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a fearful choice before me! But my resolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">held! I would carry on if it tore out my heart.

A whisper</seg><seg type="columnLine">that grew to a mighty roar! The beat of many wings!</seg><seg type="columnLine">A strange and ringing cry from the air above! A</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted, imperative, strange-toned command! Sam's</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-remembered voice! A rushing sweep of vast green</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings before my eyes! A tempest of wind as they beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air! Xenora snatched up and out of my sight by</seg><seg type="columnLine">great red tentacles!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was petrified in incredulous amazement. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible that Sam should be alive. Yet, there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">no definite proof of his death.

There were number-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less thousands of the flying plants on the wing above!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The red sky was flecked with their green wings! In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange semblance to military order they flew, like fleets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of battle-planes. In scores and hundreds they dived and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">circled, in perfect formation. Many of them, I saw, car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried weapons--vast clubs, or huge metal-tipped spears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or heavy stones and masses of metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then a flight of them swept downward again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw Sam, mounted on one that must have been Alex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ander--though the things all looked alike to me. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently controlling the whole squadron with his shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gestures. The old scientist still seemed strong and</seg><seg type="columnLine">able.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I saw Xenora. She was still in the clutch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged steed of Sam's. Even as I looked, the red tenta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles tore off the flaming violet prism and hurled it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the abyss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The weird, amazing creature dived. An incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing it was, with its armored brown body as large as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shark's, with the vast flower of the flowing colors about</seg><seg type="columnLine">its head, with red tentacles like those of a gigantic scarlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">octopus, and with wings like those of a green airplane!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It bore down upon me! A great crimson tentacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached down and picked me up! I was swept through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, held lightly in that strange grasp, and lifted until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was face to face with Sam, who sat astride the creature!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He reached out his strong brown hand and grasped my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mel, old man, it's some luck to find you! And what</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you think of my army?

The violet gleam appeared, and we made out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crater-pitted floor.

The machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was watched! It had been left as a trap! The thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing beams of purple flame reached out eagerly--</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the Omnimobile.

With mad, des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate speed, the plant creature dashed straight into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful swirling mist! It charged on through it! Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready glowing red with the disintegration beam, it struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white machine with terrific force!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The argent globe paused, hung uncertainly, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell with swift acceleration until it crashed upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of the pit, with the gleaming, wasting form of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heroic plant still clinging to it in the agony of a fearful</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long moment Sam was still.

Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on the rocket tubes. The crater was filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roaring jets of steam, and we were hurled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crimson sky!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had a fleeting glimpse of the metal brain--the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder of violet--with the green beam still throbbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it, and with the last of the silver ships battling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the victorious army of plants that swarmed about it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The roof is lifting!" Sam cried. "The equilibrium</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very delicate--the gas that kept issuing from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth was lifting the waters to the danger point, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">your explosion carried them past! The attempt to freeze</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth was probably undertaken because a roof of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice would have been more secure!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice was drowned in a fresh rushing, whistling</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst from the rocket tubes.

A sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">reached my ears--a roar, dull, distant and slumberous</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first, but rising to a crashing, deafening storm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound! It seemed an eternity that I held the sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl upon the tossing couch, while the very heavens</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocked with thunder!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly, the bloody glare grew lighter, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaked with shafts of bright sunshine--white, precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight of the upper earth! We had followed the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubble of gas through the roof of waters! The red</seg><seg type="columnLine">mists cleared--drew up into the blue vault above--re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled into outer space!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were flying in the cold white light, above a mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue sea!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In fifteen minutes Sam had brought the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon an ocean that was still heaving madly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cataclysm that had drowned a world.

"Why not there as well as in</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumps of impure carbon and water, as one of the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">savants called us? But do you remember the radio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">activity of the metal bar, and the little cells of helium</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas in it? I think the radium had somehow set up</seg><seg type="columnLine">neuronic circuits between the cells, like the circuits be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the neurone cells in our brains.

Such vast forces could not be released with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the possibility of its getting out of control altogether,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and destroying the whole earth. But the condition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind was insufferable and, as far as one could fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, the end was not yet. Far better a thousand deaths</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to be dominated and driven about like wild beasts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was solemnly decided, that come what will, here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a weapon that offered the only possible salvation--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most terrible, infinitely powerful weapon. The soul of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man rose to its supreme height.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The execution of the project called for a vast amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of labor and the highest technical skill in its preparation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But willing hands there were and keen brains; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperation had increased everyone's energy. To bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">about tire desired result the atomic conflagration had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be started right in the midst of the enemy, preferably in</seg><seg type="columnLine">many places at once. The technique of induction was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and skilful process and required a specially trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">technical knowledge, which few possessed. In fact, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was extremely difficult to induce this excitation, in view</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the newness of the process, which, like all new dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coveries, lacked refinements and improvements, such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the years can develop. But once started the heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">generated by the liberated forces within the atoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared with an explosive fierceness, unapproachable and</seg><seg type="columnLine">inextinguishable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A selected number of highly skilled technicians, drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">from men of every nation and clime, were trained under</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Hopkins, who carefully and patiently imparted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the difficult technique of the new discovery. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, in every place of refuge, in far-off lands of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, men and women labored--grimly, tirelessly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">determinedly.

Several scores</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the new racing planes, each starting from a specifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally selected point, sped straight for the enemy. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, at a tremendous height, they raced on at over</seg><seg type="columnLine">six hundred miles an hour toward their definite ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectives.

The energy which they utilized--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nature of which we never discovered, though most</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely it was a partial tapping of atomic force--was</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful and terrible enough, and we had been unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cope with it. But they knew not how to cope with</seg><seg type="columnLine">or control this new fierce energy which we released. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was this supreme stroke of human genius which finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelmed them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In vain they tried every method. In vain, with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">means at their command, they strove to halt its deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">march. The blinding glare lit the skies; night could</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely be told from day; roaring, deadly gases en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped larger and larger areas. Until finally, the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuing spread of the all-devouring conflagration had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown to such proportions over such large areas that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andromedans realized it was only a matter of time when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would all be consumed in its roaring flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They made a tremendous effort to escape from this</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. "Let Mankind perish in the fires which it started.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A world suicide! When the atomic fires encircled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire earth, a new star, bereft of all life, would an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounce itself in the firmament"--so they thought, as re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed by records they left behind. Their whole energies</seg><seg type="columnLine">were devoted toward building vast numbers of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-traveling globes, to take them back to their re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mote homeland. The clang and din of their hurried and</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate efforts to escape was a sight for the gods; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever-spreading flames a constant urge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now the last of the Andromedans departed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth, with the deprecations and curses of all hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manity. Many perished in the flames. The few remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing were put to death, as in their terribly disorganized</seg><seg type="columnLine">state they could offer no adequate resistance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then began a race with the all-spreading atomic blaze.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And here was where our complete preparations saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth for us. Mountainous quantities of the only sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance capable of stopping the world conflagration had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been manufactured and held in readiness. An entire will-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing humanity, young and old, buckled down to the hercu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lean task of building barriers of this insulating stuff--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Andromedans knew nothing of. Each area in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grip of the fiery disintegration was completely sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by these barriers, and when the flames reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">these, they could spread no further. Everyone knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a few years the burning areas would gradually burn</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The hosannas, the thanksgiving that rose to high</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Continued on page 82)</seg><seg type="columnLine">82</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Feathered Detective</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By A.

Working on the well-known prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciple, "the end justfies the means," he first</seg><seg type="columnLine">studies medicine, graduates with high hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ors, and then goes to the Congo as a mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionary. Through his uncanny talent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">learning the native dialects, he_ becomes</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of a secret cult, whose aim is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extermination of all apes. Like all re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligious fanatics, he not only kills, but de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights in torturing the poor helpless brutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by burning them alive. But fate over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes him. A Scotch explorer, McKay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a giant of a man, a scoffer and a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinker, slyly introduces him _ to a mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious .substance, an incredibly heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, which emanates rays of a peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature. These rays or emanations first</seg><seg type="columnLine">create a condition resembling complete in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toxication and leave an insatiable craving</seg><seg type="columnLine">for additional doses. At the same time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these rays change the chemical composi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of all the glands in the body; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stimulate the glands responsible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth, but reverse the effects of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glands governing the manifestations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain and soul. In other words, the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicts turn back to a state below that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the apes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swain's wife and daughter succumb to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insidious rays. McKay, who in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meantime found the chief source of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious substance in a vast meteoric</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposit, is himself succumbing, but still</seg><seg type="columnLine">has reason enough left to dispatch Swain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Chicago in order to summon scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">to destroy this substance. Swain goes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago, meets several scientists, who be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come interested in his case without know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the entire truth and an expedition is</seg><seg type="columnLine">started for the Congo. There Swain dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appears, but is tracked to a valley contain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a cavern, where they find a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantity of this heavy substance. _ While</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they are watching Swain remove a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragment of it, they are attacked by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large gang of near-human ape-like crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures under leadership of a truly gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">male, whom they dub "The Captain." A</seg><seg type="columnLine">few of the gang, not in harmony with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "Captain," are killed forthwith and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the Captain's reason snaps and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">kills the entire gang singlehanded. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain gets his arm shattered and mutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">applies for help. He gets medical atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and thereafter is their friend, guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ally. The scientists, in the mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, have examined the mysterious heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance, and classed it as an entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">new element, hitherto unknown upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, which they name "Asterium." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain, who has degenerated so far that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is without speech, displays the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">aversion to "Asterium," and leads them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another large deposit of this substance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here the emanations are very strong, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they manage to set tip an X-ray machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and succeed in disintegrating the asterium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which explodes with terrific force.

To me it seems a good custom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Most of the German jackets praise their</seg><seg type="columnLine">books profusely and almost all titles are</seg><seg type="columnLine">misleading; superlatives and super-super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">latives are employed with a deplorable</seg><seg type="columnLine">lavishncss. The book is advertised as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">satire of the importance of a work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swift's. It is, they say, a mirror of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future, and a picture of humanity in gigan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic dimensions. Looking at the book, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unbiased eye, it seems to us a fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">well written, entertaining tale, dealing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Germany submerged in a sea of foreign</seg><seg type="columnLine">immigrants, chiefly negroes, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of exploiting coteries of rich ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venturers, who have succeeded in a gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral standardization of everything. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the World War, anything foreign</seg><seg type="columnLine">--all foreign customs and habits--were</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked upon with awe and respect.

(Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the newer German books, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">one is also amply laced with all kinds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">English expressions.) Big Linus, a mul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">timillionaire, works secretly to solve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem of how to recreate a new Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">many by secretly segregating all good and</seg><seg type="columnLine">true Germans in the northern part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sweden and Finland, which he bought out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right.

It is a perfection and idealization of what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we try to accomplish when we read a story or a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">book, or go to a movie. It is entertainment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">carried to its highest refinement. In a way, it is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but a simple, logical conception, merely one step</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in reasoning ahead of the souud-and-color movie;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but that is what all really great things are: simple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It is the great and simple thing that moves us, not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the vast, complex, labored efforts to soar and to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cover the universe.

However, to get to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">real purpose of this letter:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The most interesting Fourth Dimension stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have read are those of Dr. Miles J. Breuer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clare Winger Harris (I consider Mrs. Harris'</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Fifth Dimension" something of a master-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece). Freshest in my memory is "A Baby on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune," which these two authors did jointly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but while it is a good enough tale, there is one</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather objectionable phase that I feel urged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">call to your attention. And that is: the "geodesic</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Somewhere in the story it is stated that, "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">geodesic flyer does not travel along a world-line."</seg><seg type="columnLine">That, of course, ia merely a relative term of speech,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and means, I presume, that the ship's world-line is</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed from an angle incorporating both Space</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Time, to one which runs parallel to the Tiine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimension, so that the flyer is "at rest" in Space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Consequently the flyer's "motion" depends upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">changing its state of inertia; that is, switching</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a state of motion through Space, to a posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of "rest." All very good--so far. But now</seg><seg type="columnLine">come the objections.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Firstly, in describing how the Neptunian left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth, the authors state that, "They had hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly begun to feel warm from the friction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, when they were out of it." Let me state</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if the earth's atmosphere is, say, 92 miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep, then the geodesic flyer spent five seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">within it--which is sufficient time to seriously dam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age the vessel and its occupants. For the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple reason that the flyer could not leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth at a velocity greater than the planet's orbital</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of 18.5 miles per second. This can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily perceived, since the flyer is at rest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Space, therefore the flier is not leaving tl:e earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the earth is leaving the flier, and the planet's</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbital velocity is the figure mentioned. Were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship to depart from the earth at a greater speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would have to put on some form of power and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus travel along a world-line, which would again</seg><seg type="columnLine">place it in danger of the meteors which it seeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to avoid. Incidentally the fact that the geodesic</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyer is not on a world-line (meaning it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling in space) would not save it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteors traveling toward that point in space oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupied by the vessel. For though the ship's path</seg><seg type="columnLine">lies wholly in the Fourth Dimension (meaning it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling in Time only), the ship itself is in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar three-dimensional Euclidean Space; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the world-lincs of the meteors also extend into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Time, they could intercept the path of the vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cause a collision. Perhaps my argument is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not very clearly expressed; but if you are familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">with relativity I believe you will easily grasp the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning and truth of my statements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Secondlv, in order to bring their "geodesic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  flyer" to a position of rest, the travelers would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  first have to apply a force which would hurl the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ship from the earth (with reference to an ob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ptcian«Hia'Clip and Mail Coupon TODAY"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">»	MACKINNON-FLY PUBLICATIONS, Inc., Dept. 2004-a,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jjj	381 Fourth Ave., New York, N.

This suddenly applied</seg><seg type="columnLine">force would crush the travelers to pulp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A third objection is the time required to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune. In the story, as I recall, the time re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired for the journey is about 60 earthly days.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As a matter of fact, the ship would actually be</seg><seg type="columnLine">262 days on the voyage, since its maximum</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity through the solar system is equal to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of the solar system through space--about</seg><seg type="columnLine">12 miles per second. This, of course, because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship is waiting for the orbit of Neptune to catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with it; and Neptune's orbit advances through</seg><seg type="columnLine">space at the above-mentioned rate. Were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship to travel through space at a speed of 16,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per second, as stated near the beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the 6tory, it wonld again be oa a world-line</seg><seg type="columnLine">traversing both Space and Time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fourthly: After reaching Neptune, the travel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers would have to stay on that planet for half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunian year, or 82 terrestrial ones, before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could undertake the voyage back to earth. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">because the sun must advance toward Neptune's</seg><seg type="columnLine">position in space in order to catch up with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">geodesic flyer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fifthly: The geodesic flyer would never reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune--or any other planet. This is because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orbits of the planets all lie in about the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, and the motion of the sun through space</seg><seg type="columnLine">is more vertical to that plane than level with it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hence the geodesic flyer, not partaking of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system's motion through space, would be left</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind while the sun and all its planets moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">away above it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The story itself was very entertaining, and save</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the above, I have no fault to find with it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But to my mind the geodesic flyer represents</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pinnacle of inefficiency and foolhardiness. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">were better if scientifiction authors stuck to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">good old rockets and gravity-nullifiers. The char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acters then stand a better chance of getting around</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the universe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mathematics in ''Fourth Dimensional Space</seg><seg type="columnLine">Penetrator" by Julian Kendig, Jr., were interes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting, but, sad to relate, incorrect. Or rather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of them were correct, but based upon false</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumptions and therefore leading to false con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I won't go into that now.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians arrived on earth, in the War of The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Worlds, by being shot at our planet in some such</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrivance.

Wells' story, "The Time Machine," is an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">entirely different type of story from "The Master</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ant." The only thing in common possessed by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">both stories is the use of a time machine to get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the future. But it is right here that Mr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Flagg introduces some interesting theories in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">relation to time and age not touched on by Wells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Time in its relation to space is graphically put,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and age is shown to be engendered by the action</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of environment on the organism in a given</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">period of time, not by time itself.

First of all I like A.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hyatt Verrill, David H. Keller and Harl Vincent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> best of all for their stories which combine every-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> thing--mystery, romance and thrills, action and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> adventure. The stories I have liked best, so far,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> are "Into the Green Prism" and its sequel, "Be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> yond the Green Prism," which has just started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Secret Kingdom" was good, but not as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> good as "The Skylark of Space," which I have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> read four times since it was published. "Memos,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> by Henry Janies, also was a good story. Now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that I have told you some of the stories I have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> liked I will tell you some of the stories I have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hated. "The Revolt of the Pedestrians," was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> good, but it could never happen, some people</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> might lose the use of their legs, but not all the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   In the illustration there are hardly any auto-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mobiles on the street and if you say that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> automobiles are on the lower level, how could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the people have gotten out of their cars and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> walked up to the higher level when they did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> have any legs.

Now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as to the illustrations, I think that Paul and Wesso</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ought to combinc on each picture as one has got</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the qualities that the other hasn't.

It is being done. We are</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling into the future at every second. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">real time-traveling is to either go backwards, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward in time, or to accelerate our rate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both of these have been done. Here's how: If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were to go on a ship, and travel to Europe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would gain a few hours. Travelers to Europe</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to turn their watches ahead about five hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the ocean trip--actual proof that they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained a few hours. If you were to go around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, from west to cast, you would gain a day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Jules Verne's book, "Around the World in Eighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Days.")</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If you were to go around the world from east</seg><seg type="columnLine">to west you would lose a day. But how could this</seg><seg type="columnLine">be possible, if all the while, you are traveling for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward in time? In order to lose a day, you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to travel backwards in time, not forward, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are constantly doing. Simply, it cannot be</seg><seg type="columnLine">passible to travel both bacHvards and forwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time along time. Yet, the fact re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mains, that it may be possible to do so. But how?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isn't there an explanation for this? Apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Let us assume that time is the fourth dimension,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as many of your writers have it. If we travel in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, either backwards or forwards, we are still</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling in three dimensions. Therefore, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth dimension is contained in the three dimen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions! But if that is so, then three dimensions are</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained in two I And two in onel And one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in---what? Nothing 1 Impossibilities! But any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, something of this is true. The first part, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least. And how do you explain that?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In closing, I will say that the best fourth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensional story I ever read is "Paradox" by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cl0ukcj'-	M.

There is 110 real gain or loss, cxcept in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this numerical number of days. A good illustra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is that if you go across the ocean in a modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">high sliced steamship in one direction--going</seg><seg type="columnLine">east--each day is about 23 hours in length.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coming in the other direction--to the west--each</seg><seg type="columnLine">day is about 25 hours in length.

In closing, I will say that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Amazing Stories is the magazine for people who,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in any way, are interested in science. It imparts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a greater understanding of science and gives a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">broad field to the imagination. These people who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">arc always finding some little point wrong in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stories--why don't they quit complaining and let</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the rest of us enjoy the magazine?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                      C.

They are watched for most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">carefully, but as you say or imply, none of us are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perfect, so there are bound to be some errors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Seeming impossibilities are perfectly in place in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the stories.

Not only would a rocket propel an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">air vessel through a vacuum, but the action of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rocket would be far better in a vacuum than in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">air. Once the rocket got the airship going and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lifted it out of the earth atmosphere into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vacuum of space, a minimum effort or very slight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">action would be required to keep it traveling in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">definitely except for gravitation, because in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">absence of air there would be nothing to stop it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from going.
