            <seg type="columnLine">caught the eye: Astride the stream was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was hanging a miniature castle, exactly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as its mistress had said. Sunk in the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the slender spire of a chapel, the terrace,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I could not see it because of the trees, I</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">sharp, doubling upon itself, to gain the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I saw it curl into the meadows some fifty</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">into the village place, and then up a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">very steep hill which presently brought</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, however, the ship began to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">wool from Australia to England. Our</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">only armament was a single 4.7-inch gun,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which might have proved a dangerous</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">learned his name, and we referred to him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as "Babyface." He was the man we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">communicated with most while we were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the ship. It was he who conveyed to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">us the captain's orders, he who listened</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to our complaints, he who--very, very</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the Germans, apparently, had a mania</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">after making a few complimentary re-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">marks about it, he pocketed it. Then</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">This was E Deck. As we entered our</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">realization of what a terrible place this</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It turned out that what cigarettes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they had were long gone, and it tickled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them to hear me talk so casually about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">such a rare and precious thing. It ap-</seg>
