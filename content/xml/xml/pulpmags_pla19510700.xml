Any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man who can deduce the cultural, educational and intellectual lev-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">els of the several members of a geographically disparate group of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">letter writers is at least a crystal-gazer and at best a genius--m</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">either case a potentially useful citizen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Strong considers these "parasitical dilettantes" equivalent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to a hole in the head of the body SF.

This puzzles me. Why should</seg><seg type="columnLine">any person start discussing in such a manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">something he knows little or nothing about?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unless it be for the above mentioned reasons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This Strong character (no pun intended)</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to lack an understanding of the basic</seg><seg type="columnLine">workings of the average American. In any group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of people interested in the same specialized form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of work, entertainment, etc., there is bound to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a dialectic deviation from the King's English.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is to be found everywhere, such as among</seg><seg type="columnLine">amateur radio operators, the armed services,</seg><seg type="columnLine">musicians, lumbermen, and so on. Why not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">among s-f_ devotees also? Then, humor is one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the basic characteristics of our people, or of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any human. Fans, being like any other human,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a sense of humor and- use it. And being</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of clannish, as would be "hams," it is often</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood only by them because of the fiction</seg><seg type="columnLine">they read. Imaginative fiction and imaginative</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds combine to make such a thing as Ken</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beale's "worple" and its use funny only to fans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And what's wrong with that?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, anything can be overdone. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">humor sometimes is, but there has been a notice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able cut-down both on the part of the letter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">writers and the editor's request. Then we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">your "cultist leanings ..." Is this supposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">refer to Dianetics yet?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there is the matter of commenting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stories and artwork. In the first place, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strong, it is a basis of Democracy that one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">can comment freely about any subject he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sires as long as he doesn't violate the other man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights. Fans happen to make use of this right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Especially since it is the policy of most s-f pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lications to request such comments for publica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and consideration. Most readers have read</seg><seg type="columnLine">stf for many years and can't help but gain some</seg><seg type="columnLine">little knowledge of the writing of science-fiction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not being trained critics, we can't always write</seg><seg type="columnLine">flawlessly accurate criticisms of each story, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in most cases the writer usually knows whereof</seg><seg type="columnLine">he writes. Authors sometimes request such opin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions privately from fans. So it can't all be</seg><seg type="columnLine">drivel!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here and there you make direct reference to</seg><seg type="columnLine">names. Sometimes this could be actionable. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, this is merely a case of self-centered igno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rance. It so happens that you, Mr. Strong, don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know Rick Sneary and why his letters appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they do. I must say that he makes a lot more</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense than you do when he writes a letter. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't knorv Redd Boggs and all the others. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely know how to write insults founded on</seg><seg type="columnLine">your own ignorance of other human beings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This certainly strikes me as being a case of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sour grapes at least. And, of course, only you</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand Ray Bradbury's writings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A peak of ignorance on your part is the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">polite way you refer to the name of Isaac Asi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mov. Every man has the right to respect for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">name and it is only reasonable in polite society</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for a man to wish that his name be spelled cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly. It is therefore very poor form and also</seg><seg type="columnLine">betrays little intelligence on your part to author</seg><seg type="columnLine">that last paragraph. It reminds me of a punished</seg><seg type="columnLine">child's attitude after his censuring parent has</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hitn standing^n the corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is about fall I care to stomach of Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strong's letter.

Longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories such as Craig's WITCH OF THE DE-</seg><seg type="columnLine">MON SEAS and la Brackett's BLACK AMA-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ZON OF MARS hold to the line of competent</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-adventure to be found in each issue of PS.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least I liked them. Shorter stories such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lang's GUEST EXPERT, Anderson's DUEL</seg><seg type="columnLine">ON SYRTIS and Oberfield's POISON PLAN-*</seg><seg type="columnLine">ET_ exemplify the growing quality of the short</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories. Addition of such authors as Horace Fyfe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and van Vogt are notable and welcome. I also</seg><seg type="columnLine">applaud the addition of Paul Orban to your art</seg><seg type="columnLine">staff. His drawing for van Vogt's story in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">March issue showed more pep than a lot of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work has in a long time. Cartier also welcome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The reprint was not, though. The story was good</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the idea of reprints isn't.

Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were out in space on the way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andrigo, Single wouldn't dare to question</seg><seg type="columnLine">the standard lie too much--merely as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of saving his own self-respect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, sooner or later, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn that Hawk was using him again, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to trap Greenies so Hawk and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men could transport them back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave-market on Eros.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he withdrew the fist as if by conscious ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort and crumpled back in the chair.

A devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">of delight came to Hawk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I won't claim it was out of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">humanitarian impulse, John-boy," he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on.

Anyway--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MOST OF THE STORY was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight goods, at that. Hawk told</seg><seg type="columnLine">it well. After all, a man could put him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in the shoes of the Greenies if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">any kind of heart. They inhabited the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet Andrigo, so far above the plane of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ecliptic, although near the Sun, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was out of the regular trade-routes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plant-people, they were, but superficially</seg><seg type="columnLine">humanoid; an old race--maybe too old</seg><seg type="columnLine">--sedentary like all plants, even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did have limbs. But something had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened in the evolution chain. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying off. Not only was the planet pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressing slowly outward from the Sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the centuries, but one of those un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">predictable climatic changes had come over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet in the last thousand years. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">a teeming civilization that covered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, they had dropped to a population</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprised of scattered, isolated villages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk carefully excluded the informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that much of the population decline</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the last twenty years was more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less directly attributable to the outlawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave-trade. That was strictly a hush-hush</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, inasmuch as the high-pressure boys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">millionaires and politicians, bought Green-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies at high prices and used them as gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deners on their lush planetary estates;</seg><seg type="columnLine">being plants themselves, Greenies had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable feeling for other growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">things of the plant class. In an unsea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonably short time, most enslaved Greenies</seg><seg type="columnLine">died from adverse climatic and soil con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions; but you could always replace them</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you knew the right people. And had</seg><seg type="columnLine">money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you the Greenies were still dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">off," Hawk said with all the earnestness at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his command. "Botanists have laid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame to a lack of auxins. Plant hormones</seg><seg type="columnLine">control every factor of growth, size and</seg><seg type="columnLine">longevity, same as animal hormones do in</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals. John-boy, the main trouble is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the Greenies reach the seeding stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of growth, their roots have all but stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing. They die before they can repro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce. That's where I come in. My cargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">this trip is a few dozen hogsheads of indele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acetic acid, the plant-hormone which stim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulates root-growth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Single was hanging attentively on every</seg><seg type="columnLine">word. He smiled sheepishly. "You had me</seg><seg type="columnLine">fooled, Hawk.

"But once in awhile, a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">realizes he has to live with himself, John-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy. In fact, that's exactly the reason I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to hire you as emissary." Pie squirmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. His face was actually red and flush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed ; sweat was pendant on his forehead. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finding it harder to go on with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasted lie; if only John-boy didn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dewy shine of an idealist in his eyes!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The same blasted hero-worship he'd had</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Hawk at Decimal Point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk had to wrench his eyes away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's just that you're pure in heart, John-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy. We're not. We're rotten to the core,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one of us, and the Greenies can</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense that. The minute they saw me or</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody else on this ship--they'd scatter</seg><seg type="columnLine">like jack-rabbits and never come back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their village even if we soaked the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">in indele-acetic."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Single's thoughtful comprehension was</seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE-SHIP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">manifest on his face.

The horribly twist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed plants and withered trees of that pitiless</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert bent and were demolished as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship furrowed through the sand. Instantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all was an orderly confusion, as the amid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships gangway was let down, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad-tired planetruck, with a truck-bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as big as the floor of a large house, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">yo-heave-hoed rolling from the ship. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the astromen went fast at the work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">loading her with hogshead after hogshead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of indele-acetic acid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny Single stood watching.

He was scared stiff Hawk might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be using him again. Stubbornly he reject-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the notion. He was committed to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, and had better sponge his mind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt, seeing that the Greenies, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit of communication through regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">channels, were strangely gifted in an ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sense disharmony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He relaxed at the wheel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">12	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAWK, CORPIN and several other</seg><seg type="columnLine">men stood atop the space-ship, star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing tensely at the Greenies' village through</seg><seg type="columnLine">electronically amplified binoculars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk's dark face was grim with satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction.

The village</seg><seg type="columnLine">concourse swarmed as the Greenies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn toward the fatal hormone. At first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a sense of orderliness, as the hogs-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads were bunged, containers brought;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the drinking commenced, orderly too</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first. Then the action shifted to a blur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">red vista of green shapes, insensibly im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bibing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk got a fix on Single. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickened and disgusted--• that much was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain on his drawn face. Plainly he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for a chance to back the truck</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God/' said Corpin, staying with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">obsession, "works in strange ways, Hawk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You wouldn't think He'd make Greenies</seg><seg type="columnLine">this stupid, the poor souls, if they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">souls."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God," said Hawk, voice edged with</seg><seg type="columnLine">mimicry, "made plants to open wide their</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves when it rained. Well, it's raining."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later, Hawk figured the stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">was set in the distant village. The men</seg><seg type="columnLine">haded into the other planetruck, testing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sharpness of their knives. On the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the village, the planetruck driven by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Single came roaring from the opposite di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection. The trucks came to a stop abreast</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other and Single came jumping out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's up?" he called, catching Hawk's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk didn't answer the question. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "What's the idea bringing that plane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truck back? We'll need it." He motioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of his men, who took over the wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Single's truck, backed it around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set its blunt snout pointing toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">village again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Single looked baffled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have any trouble?" Hawk called gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ially. But his eyes were cold, unfriendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">slits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not much," said Single. "Naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">they trusted me." He grabbed Hawk's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankle where Hawk sat in the cab of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetruck at the wheel. His eyes were full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dumb misery. "Listen, Quinn. What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea? You don't want to go into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">village when they're--when they're--well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was surprised, the way it affected them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Auxins may be what they need--they act-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually grew roots while I watched; but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes them--drunk. They're blinko."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yah, emissary," grinned one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, leaning over the railing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me what's going on, Hawk,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Single said quietly. He started climbing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fender, but one of the men shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk said, "No rough stuff." Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought deliberately cruel eyes back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Single. At the acute misery which stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at him, he experienced a wrench of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure, unexpected pain. "Well," he shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">full into Single's face, "did you expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to tell a sap like you the truth? We're</seg><seg type="columnLine">slavers, John-boy, slavers! What else?" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rammed in the starter and the planetruck</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped ahead. But Johnny Single was a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board. One terrific leap of fury had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into the cab, both arms around Hawk's</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck. In a threshing heap, Hawk and Sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle tumbled from the leaping truck, fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">just free of the grinding wheels. Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt himself curiously immobile, as if rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed of the will to defend himself. He let</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself be hauled to his feet, allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Single's oncoming fist to connect with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw. His brain seemed to burst. Fancy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kid having a punch like that. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Single stood over him while the truck</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped a hundred feet away, disgorging</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who came running excitedly back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Single shouted down at Hawk in uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trollable, almost incoherent rage. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, lie there. Let me kick you. But it isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be that easy, thinking you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">salve your conscience by letting me beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">you up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hauled the unresisting Hawk erect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed him back down again.

She sent me to see if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were changed, if that spark of decency</seg><seg type="columnLine">you used to have had grown to make you</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody worthwhile. She still loves you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinn. She didn't want me, I just hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to be there when she had to get rid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you. Yeah! And you still love her, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see it in your slimy eyes. Well, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've got plenty to tell her, Quinn!

"Get at it. We've wasted enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT THE VILLAGE, the majority of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Greenies were already in their tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">por, fastened by swift-growing roots to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earthen floors of their huts. They sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, like green dwarfs, with delicate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleshy appearing roots growing out of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, leg and shoulder joints. Some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger Greenies cavorted about the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men, screaming threats, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't enough of them to put up any re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance. Soon knives were flashing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacers were old hands at this game, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">record time cut the Greenies free from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their restraining roots, loaded them eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep in the trucks. When the village was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaned out, Hawk gave a deliberate coarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny Single was right. There's noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing left, a still dead voice agreed.

Be a worse rat even</seg><seg type="columnLine">than John-boy thinks you are.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some distance away, Corpin the Pious</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched Hawk with mild interest.

The last time we cut the Greenies</seg><seg type="columnLine">--which was the first time for him--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured he was sick to his stomach. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's got this Madge to plague him; every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">strong man has his Delilah."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe we better--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cautiously, cautiously," Corpin waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spacer quiet. "Hawk's still got a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">men on his side--let him have plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to turn even them against him. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been waiting for some situation like this."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Greenies had been locked in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil-cells, and in his cabin Hawk lay on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cot in the darkness, seemingly quiescent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But agonized fire burned in his brain. Sick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening lurches of memory carried him down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the past. Hawk hadn't been much the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman with Madge; mistakenly, he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed her to have his own wild nature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But beneath the bubble and froth of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">personality was a quiet surface. The third</seg><seg type="columnLine">time his escapades made her break off with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he had laughed it off, skipped half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">semester, gone on a hell-bending trip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he got back, Single had crossed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the wedding date was set. Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't stay around for the wedding, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as he was graduated, got out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. He'd been running away ever since.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And all he'd ever accomplished by those</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of trying to forget was to make him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self realize that he achingly loved Madge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk tossed on the cot. Damn the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">John-boy set foot on this ship. He roused</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Corpin called for take-off orders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk went woodenly through his paces.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're sure Single's aboard?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw him," Corpin's voice came.

Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corpin was grieved. "God help us all,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said piously.

Hawk jammed over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">14-	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cut-off, the black scowl lingering on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.

Deep in</seg><seg type="columnLine">him he sensed the gross answer: the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sochism of the sinful--and Corpin was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whip. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT CONVERSATION planted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">seed. Two and a half days after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">S. S.

Single entered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took one startled look at the dozen quiet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced men who leaned against the walls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat on the cot or other articles of furniture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a grim smiling spark in Hawk's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "John-boy," he said, "yesterday you of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered Corpin to help mutiny if he'd take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Greenies back to Andrigo."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Single's eyes were big on the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">each man carried. Finally: "Corpin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy/' he said. "He doesn't know sarcasm</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he hears it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I figured you might be ribbing him,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Hawk. "Here's my proposition. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">quitting this life. Slaving's a bit too rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">a racket for me and I'm getting out. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">dedded to take the Greenies back to An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drigo. These men are all members of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">original crew, and they're with me. Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erally they get a commission on the sale</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each Greenie. I'll make it good to them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whose side you on?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yours," said Single.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's a gun," said Hawk. He passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a five-pound jim-cracker to Single. Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely observed the way Single slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed two fingers into the trigger-guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What gave you the idea?" Single said</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last, meeting Hawk's eyes steadily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk bitterly resented the knowing look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you think it's Madge, you're crazy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said shortly. "I had the stink of slave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">running in my nose a long time before you</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the act. Now, men," he said, facing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others, "as far as Corpin knows, you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">all off watch in your bunks; I arranged it</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way months ago, you remember, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">case it ever came to a showdown. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">showdown's here. No killing if possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but don't get fooled."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After having one of the men inspect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor outside, Hawk led the men in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">body down toward the engine-room, heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ship, from which every important</seg><seg type="columnLine">function was controlled. They moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly, almost unbreathing. Outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine-room hatch, Hawk delegated three</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to space themselves through the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor, to nab any men who might not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stationed below. Then Hawk boldly opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hatchway, entered, stood on the balcony</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlooking the machine-filled engine-room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here and there a man stood at his post;</seg><seg type="columnLine">others were undoubtedly out of Hawk's</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of sight. Corpin was not to' be seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk opened the door again, gestured</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the men. Single fell into step behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk as they easily descended the ladder</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the engine-room deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take over your regular posts," Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke to those following him. "Tell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men it's my orders that they be relieved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If they object, shove your jim-crackers in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their ribs. Might be a good thing if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do that anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes sharpened as three of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted off toward the three men visible be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the protonoclast gauges. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have given a lot to know just where Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin was; chances were--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sudden, sharp crash of a jim-crack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er set steel plates to ringing. Hawk whirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, in time to see Single's face pouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat, his blond hair awry on his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and in his hand his jim-cracker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still spitting static.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Single was wildly, desperately excited.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's a trap," he yelled at Hawk. "Corpin</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I saw him up there at the port. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to blast him." *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE WAS A ROW of portholes</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking down on the engine room</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the corridor where Hawk had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">other men stationed. Hawk's stomach</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to drop out of his body in a sick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening swoop. A trap was impossible. Corpin</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have known--unless he hud put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea into Hawk's head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The metallic echoes of Single's fire had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly ceased their reverberations when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine-room was suddenly alive with</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. From behind the machines, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">every possible hiding place, Corpin's men</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured, weapons drawn. Hawk blew out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breath, savagely let go with his jim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE-SHIP TO ANDRIGO	15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cracker, glanced wildly toward the ladder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead of his men, Corpin and two others</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mutinous crew members appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're outnumbered," Corpin roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at Hawk. "Give up! I'll let you go</seg><seg type="columnLine">with your life, Hawk!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For answer, Hawk's arm flew up as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">by subconscious impulse. The wild thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of murder was in his head. But he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowled backward as two men overflowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; the charge went wild and Hawk was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat on his back. From the direction his</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge had traveled, Hawk saw a blue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">white flare as the explosion came. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought incredulously, I hit the air-re~</seg><seg type="columnLine">finer. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His weapon was tom out of his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The chill recognition of utter disaster over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came him, but with it came recklessness</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well. In him was the unholy desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">for immolation, a manifestation of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion which made him take Single's</seg><seg type="columnLine">manhandling. He needed punishment, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extreme punishment of dying with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jim-cracker in his gizzard. With a roar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stretched himself erect, and tore into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attackers with an ugly, bloody delight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three men fell before his blows. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk stumbled--over Single's prone body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the act of falling, one of the wipers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a runt, stepped in at an angle, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full power of both clasped fists, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk across the back of the neck. Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell to his knees, rose to his full height</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if his reflexes might overcome the stun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning force of that blow, and then fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusively flat on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAWK WAS LYING on his side</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he awoke. He groaned miser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably, rolled to his back. When the base of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his skull touched the cold supra-steel floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cell, he jerked it out of contact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wincing with the thudding pain. For a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he was sick in every fiber of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaten body. That passed. Then he smelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigarette smoke and a cigarette was shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">between his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Smoke that," said Single, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">moody.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk lay perfectly motionless, keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes closed while he quietly smoked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through his eyelids poured light, that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 800-watt duro-globe set into the over-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heads above the cell. Without looking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk knew every item of furnishing--</seg><seg type="columnLine">two chairs, table, wall food-slot, crude</seg><seg type="columnLine">washstand, Johnnie--they were imprison-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, in short, in the well-known brig, a cage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of walls and bars composed of supra-steel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Escape from here was an impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The brig was placed in the bottommost</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold, a triangular compartment wedged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the fission motors on one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and No. 2 rotor on the other, with inch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick supra-steel walls between. Above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muted, pounding thrust of the rotor, Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear the leaf-like rustle of the Green-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies' talk; they were also quartered here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in soil-bins stretching along the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the hold. Hawk had heard that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greenies talked, but had never been con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronted with the fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened his eyes, rolled them until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw Single, who was sitting cross-leg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ged at the composition table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen to them talk, John-boy," Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">said softly. "Makes you realize they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be so far from being human."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah, it does, doesn't it?" Single's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pale, lifeless, and wouldn't meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk said, his words remorseless as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashing whip across his own back, "Oh, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what you think of me, John-boy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remember you asked me what gave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea of taking the Greenies back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andrigo? John-boy, it was Corpin who</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted the seed in my head, and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">it sprout. He was ready and waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, any time I made the break. And I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool enoiigh not to realize it." He smoked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking straight up toward the overheads.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He mused, "How much of a fool can one</seg><seg type="columnLine">man be in a lifetime, John-boy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll tell you," said Single. His mood</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the same, bitter and without life. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be fool enough to marry a girl who</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't love him. That's me." He jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thumb indicatively against his chest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You were the right man for her--you</seg><seg type="columnLine">still could be. Now neither of us will see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth again, much less Madge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Unless we fight our way free," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk, sitting up. He decided he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the trend of the conversation. Bleakly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew in his heart that the old romance</seg><seg type="columnLine">16	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was dead; even the flowers of memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">should riot be laid at the sunken grave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> : "What's our first step to freedom, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">instance?" Single said, without interest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">: Hawk said cryptically, "To want free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom. I want it, and all I want it for is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get those Greenies back to Andrigo. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, I don't much care."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">: Single looked blank. Then he painfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose; his clothes were half-torn off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, his skin was lacerated and bruised in</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous places, indicating the terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle he'd put up. He gave Hawk a hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled him to his feet. Single smiled weari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You beat everything, Hawk. You took</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage of my angelic nature at Decimal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Point, but in return you took me out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">some fine binges with the idea of showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">me about life. It's the same thing all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, except--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk grinned, but said soberly, "Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept that this time we might both learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">about death."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the Greenies set up an excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaf-twittering, rushed to the bars of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cells. The rusted hatch door to the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment was pushed aggressively open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The weirdly green, peaked faces of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greenies were illuminated in the shaft of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light from the outer compartment- Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Single leaped to the bars, their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the advancing figure. It was Corpin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He strode with lordly magnificence to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell, pendulous jowls quivering with fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been sinful in my day, Hawk," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled, "but my sins don't compare with</seg><seg type="columnLine">your unGodly acts. I personally noted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you deliberately sent a bullet into the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">refinery. This means we have no air ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept that in the ship and we've still got</seg><seg type="columnLine">three days in space. Possibly several crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">members will die--including your so-called</seg><seg type="columnLine">loyal men, who have sworn in with me</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that your little coup is a failure. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">here'to warn you that we must therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut this compartment off from the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circulating network."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk studied him. "What about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greenies ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corpin was really in a panic. "Who's</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried about the Greenies at a time like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this?" he blubbered. "This is serious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk!" He started for the hatch door,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">arms swinging like lumpy pendulums.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk called, sternly after him, "Am I</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand you intend for us to asphyx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iate, Mr. Corpin?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope your air holds out," Corpin</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "That's all I can say for you and .your</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, God rest you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thi heavy, rusted door swung shut be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him, bounced open, subsided again to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shut position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SINGLE WAS LOOKING at the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">longingly. "Did you actually send a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet into the air-refinery on purpose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk grunted. "Naturally not. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corpin's excuse to practice effortless mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der." His deep eyes were roving the cell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingered on the furniture. He started to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward it. "Help me break up this table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">John-boy," he said. His voice was uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain. "Might be able to use a couple crow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By prodigious effort and the use of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt-buckles as screwdrivers, they took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table apart. It required an hour or longer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk used the table legs in an attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bend some of the bars. The bars had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost non-existent coefficient of elasticity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, and besides this, there was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough leverage. Grimly and sweating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk hurled the table-legs into a corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine way to bum oxsh--oxshgen." His</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue got mixed in his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's burn shome more." Single's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was extraordinarily shrill, his eyes lumin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous. He cracked a match into flame.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk's eyes narrowed on the brilliant blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">flare, then he thoughtfully took a cigarette.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly, his mind seemed to skip a whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequence of thoughts. When he was aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, the cigarette was burned a quarter</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, and he was pacing with terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy up and down the length of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brig. His mind soared. He was drunk!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thash it!" he shouted, stopping in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks. Unsteadily, he got in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Single, who was senselessly pacing also;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, leaving the cigarette dangling from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips, clamped his giant's hands on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Single's shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk's vision was blurred, but he fo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cused long enough to see that the pupils</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Single's eyes were big and out of con- *</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol. "Shstand still," Hawk shouted thickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Schumping's wrong--but it's blasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">good! We're blind drunk, oxshgen-drunk!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's the Greenies, That utter ignoramus</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corpin!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Single grinned laxly. "Have 'nother shi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garette, Hawk of the Spashways. Burn up</seg><seg type="columnLine">more oxygen. Too much oxygen, Hawk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spashways. Remember how they put</seg><seg type="columnLine">us through oxygen tesh in a Spashship at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deshmal Point? Drunk then, too. Problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to releash enough Shee-O-Two into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air to bring air back to normal.

Hawk's brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on fire, partly from the effort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was an eery, down-beat note that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be likened to a dirge. Forcing his eyes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">focus by sheer will, Hawk saw the Green-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies, slumped in weirdly contorted positions</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the bars of the soil-bins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were smothering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their air supply was bad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN HAWK burgeoned the desire to laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a bubbling, chuckling emotion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew unreasonably out of his horror.

Gasping, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell to hands and knees, crawled across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor to Single, who was sprawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall, smiling foolishly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lishen, John-boy," said Hawk confi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dentially.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stacked the table-top against the bars of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cell, used Single's shirt as kindling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">applied flame.

He had practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost identity with duration, would forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">his purpose in doing one thing no sooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he started on another. But deep in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">subconscious was an intense striving for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ultimate effect, a brass ring that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling conscious mind could only pluck</seg><seg type="columnLine">at each time round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This subconscious urging received a</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure of gratification when flame blos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">somed through the shirt, bit eagerly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table-top. It was a white-hot flame,</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned with a sizzling fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good work, Hawk of Spashways,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled Johnny Single. "Pretty fire, Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Spashways. Bet Corpin could kick him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelf."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind the red film drawn across his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, the alert part of Hawk's brain sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a crouched animal in the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head. The fire shot up with pristine</seg><seg type="columnLine">purity, a lactescent flame without the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traying yellowness of escaping gases. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the concentrated fury of an oxygen-torch</seg><seg type="columnLine">it beat against the supra-steel bars against</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the table-top leaned. When these</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars glowed first red and then began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">assume the whitish color of the flames</seg><seg type="columnLine">laving them, Hawk aroused Single by</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapping his face, palm and backhand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Single took it in the spirit in which it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended, rose. Hawk shoved one table</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg at him, took the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gotta work fast, John-boy," he mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered. "No more fuel. Faster the fuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">burns, lesh oxshen, shlower fuel burns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesh heat. Catch?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," said Single. "Makesh lotsh of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shee-O-Two for Greenies, though."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Two of the bars which stretched from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE-SHIP TO ANDRIGO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                ft</seg><seg type="columnLine">18	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">deck to overheads were now at white heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">for two feet of their length, were soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to yield to the battering blows the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men now directed against them. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparks arose in a spitting shower as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table-top crashed in ruins. The two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped back. A wounded expression ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared on Single's face as he slapped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the burns on face and bare chest. Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept on ramming at his bar, endeavoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to widen the space of escape. But the bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scaling down to red, now that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no flame on it. Single solved the prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lem by holding the already charred end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his improvised battering ram in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coals on the floor. It caught flame instant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. Single held it against the bar Hawk was</seg><seg type="columnLine">working on. So furiously and potently</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the virtually pure oxygen of the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere unite with its fuel that the bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">again whitened, softened. At each plunk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blow it gave another inch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over the labored panting of Hawk, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spit of flame, the pound of the battering</seg><seg type="columnLine">ram, came a growing murmur from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greenies. Hawk was elated. It was ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious that enough carbon dioxide had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">added to the air to revive the suffocating</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant-people. Conversely, Hawk felt less</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that heady, disagreeable drunkenness he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had experienced before the oxygen per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centage went down. He gave the bar a</seg><seg type="columnLine">final blow, and then, with a huge grin of</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph, tossed his battering ram crashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's it," he shouted at Single. "Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. You're feeling better?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God, yes." Single dropped the consum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed table-leg in time to avoid burning his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers. He weaved weakly to a chair, fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it. "I'm all burned out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk took the other chair, set fire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. "There's still too much oxygen in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air for us or the Greenies. Let's sit on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor for awhile. Throw that chair on too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we'll get the hell out of here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE FIRE burned with yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, fairly lazy tongues of flame,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two men slipped through the cooled</seg><seg type="columnLine">aperture in the cell bars. In the cells op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite, the Greenies were clustered solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the bars. Hawk grinned at them, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit dizzily--the last vestiges of the oxy-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORMES	'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gen-jag disappearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chummy rascals," said Hawk.

"They sense you're on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their side, Quinn. Probably you couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a better character-endorsement."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk flung him a look. "So what should</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do, carry one around in my pocket as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">testimonial ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Madge won't need much persuading,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Single.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who said anything about Madge? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk too much. Let's get out of here "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as they set foot in the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment and Hawk smelled the pecu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liar deadness of the air--caused partly by</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of air-circulation, partly by out-size</seg><seg type="columnLine">amounts of See-O-Two--Hawk's plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped full-born into his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think we're going to lick Corpin, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloated psalm-singer," he told Single. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next compartment is right by the engine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. It's a storage compartment, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's at least a ton of waste in the bins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for us to set fire to it. Then watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">those rats scuttle into the trap! First we</seg><seg type="columnLine">need some air-helmets, if they haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">already commandeered them-- in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">case we'll have to get along without 'em!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"First, I need a shirt," said Single, ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turing at his nakedness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk tossed Single his jacket, then led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way. With luck, they shouldn't run in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to much opposition at first; most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men would be concentrated in the engine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room or else off-watch in their bunks. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">led Single to the upper deck. Hawk was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just working the combination-lock on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lazarette when he heard a footstep. He and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Single froze tensely against the lazarette</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. The man who came into sight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">big Nibley, who had been one of Hawk's</seg><seg type="columnLine">original crew-members in the day when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk's only business venture was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly honest one of running weapons to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beleaguered colonists on Triton. Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped against hope that Nibley would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on past, but the big man saw them instant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. His mouth fell open while he stared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk stepped out into the open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fall in with us, Nibley," he said softly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"With luck, we'll be able to take over from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corpin."</seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE-SHIP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Painful uncertainty passed over Nibley's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Then he blurted, "I can't, Hawk! You</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't got a chance! Corpin would mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der' me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE SPUN on his heel, ran panting to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the nearest ladder. Bitterly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointed, Hawk went off after him, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by the belt, yanked, chopped savagely</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his temple. Nibley squirmed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck. Hawk hit him again, convulsively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then came back to the lazarette, panting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the kind of loyalty I can ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect," he growled. He jerked open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lazarette door. The room was well stock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. The men buckled each other's air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmets; then Hawk stuck broken match-</seg><seg type="columnLine">es into the oxygen valves of the remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">few helmets. The oxygen hissed out, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would continue to do so until the tiny tanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were empty. They took a jim-cracker a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece from the wall, then descended to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next deck again, entered the storage com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment adjacent to the engine-room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here Hawk tossed a lighted match into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bin of waste. A sluggish flame came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">being; but since the oxygen content of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air was already low, clouds of humid</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke snuffed it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment that worried Hawk; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw smoke still rolling out, and assum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed that the kindling point was being main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained, that the waste would rapidly smould-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er. Which made it even better for his pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's get an armful of this waste, John-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy." Hawk gestured to a nearby bin, ig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nored Single's puzzled look. By the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the compartment was heavy with smoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were loaded up and staggering to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the engine-room door. Hawk freed</seg><seg type="columnLine">two fingers to pull at the handle, then kick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the door open the rest of the way. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference in temperature between the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gine-room and the smoke-filled compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment instantly created a suction effect--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotter air in the engine room grabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the cooler smoke, brought it rolling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">in great turgid masses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under cover of the smoke barrier, Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted the new fuel, threw it twenty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the engine room. Above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spit of the protonoclasts and the rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound of the rotors, Hawk heard men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO ANDRIGO	19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting. He gripped the railing; through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rift in the voluminous clouds he saw men</seg><seg type="columnLine">running, beating at the smoldering masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of waste. Hawk's eyes snapped, narrowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he saw Corpin actually running toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the disturbance, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffy and already reddened from smoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corpin was carrying a fire-extinguisher.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was about to up-end it when Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled his jim-cracker, and, aiming with</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme care, shot it out of his hands. Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin stood stricken, slowly raising his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if they would inevitably be drawn to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenging figure at the railing. Inspired</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate distorted his face; he pulled his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon, but whirlpools of smoke seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to suck him under. The shot never came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More waste," Hawk snapped at Single,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Single had already gone and was back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with another armload. Hawk threw it over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, then grabbed at Single and felt his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way down the broad ladder. As they reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the deck, choking shadows darted past</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, grabbed at the ladder, and dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves up. Hawk blundered past seve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ral machines, anxious to get to the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumps, fearful that Corpin would get there</seg><seg type="columnLine">first. However, at that moment Hawk heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corpin's voice nearby, screaming wordless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly in a high vindictive tone--he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat shadowy form fighting through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke, reached out and grabbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corpin choked rackingly. Primeval loath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing showed in his almost blinded eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he saw Hawk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I might have known," he snarled. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great brain from Decimal Point can't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any better way to take over the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to burn up our few remaining liters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of oxygen. That space-helmet will last</seg><seg type="columnLine">you approximately another hour. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll be as dead as the rest of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lunged, kicking mightily at Hawk's</seg><seg type="columnLine">groin. Hawk leaped back, grabbed Corpin</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the ankle, brought him down with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sodden thump. He whipped a boot-tip at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fat throat, but Corpin rolled, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed by smoke. Hawk heard his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cough ascending the ladder. Single wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly started after, but Hawk gently stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He can't go where the smoke can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow him," he told Single. "I'll show you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This way." He stopped at the waste-dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">20	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">posal slot. Here a pile of oily waste had</seg><seg type="columnLine">collected. Hawk scooped up a great arm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful. Singly followed suit. Hawk dumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">it at the base of the air-circulating pumps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were at present not in operation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and threw over the switch. The pump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors whirred into action. Smoke was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sucked through the grating. Single caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">on instantly, chuckled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk carefully studied</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the ventilator-duct board. Here, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">remote control, he could cut oil or close</seg><seg type="columnLine">any compartment in the ship to the action</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the air-pumps. Which meant he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill the ship with smoke. He started throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing most of the ducts open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was Single who thought of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greenies. "Lord, by this time they're suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">focating on too much oxygen again, Quinn!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe a little smoke--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hawk whitened. If the Greenies died,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so would everybody else. He opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greenies' duct wide, then hurriedly set</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire to the new pile of waste. The dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke poured into the ventilators like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. After a minute, however, Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the Greenies' duct; that too was</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the plan. But now a devil of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainty was plaguing him. If the Green-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies were dead--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waited a short while longer in in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing nervousness. Then he stepped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the auditory system of speaking-tubes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched the connections over to "general."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tuned the amplification up so that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice would have a booming, all-powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">impact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men," he stated raspingly, "Corpin has</seg><seg type="columnLine">made fools of you! If you think he's fitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for command, even of a junk-heap like this</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, you're bigger fatheads than I thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even with the help of God, he wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to make a go of it. When he dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the air-refinery was blinko, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went addle-pated, didn't have the brains</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remember that Greenies, being plants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce oxygen and would have made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good air-refinery themselves. They still</seg><seg type="columnLine">will! So now get busy! Tell Corpin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to hell! Get his keys to the Greenies'</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell!

Single felt toward him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to speak, but Hawk said savagely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't worry, John-boy, I know approxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mately what I'm doing. Keep that smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring in there while I'm gone, and shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody that might try to stop you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Single hesitated. Then he said patiently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I was going to say I don't think the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew will throw over Corpin just on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basis of what you told. them. You've just</seg><seg type="columnLine">given Corpin some brand-new information</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do you in with. Better not trust him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nor any of the crew either, Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought glumly as he went on the double</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the next deck; Nibley had taught him</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lesson. Blast the man who'd let his</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole life go to pot, mix in with a bunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of swill, just because a woman threw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUTSIDE THE HOLD where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greenies were captive, Hawk rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably against a bulkhead, a grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile touching his lips. He wasn't any too</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon. Dim, coughing shapes came footing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it through the thick smoke. The glow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamps set into the overheads showed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men only as shadows, but Hawk was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to count those shadows; twenty-six</seg><seg type="columnLine">all told, and that included Nibley--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corpin. Never was flight more precipitous;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hatch door slammed shut triumphantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the men entered the only place aboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship where there was a reasonable guar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antee of oxygen.;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trap had worked to perfection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the Greenies were still alive . . . The</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt had Hawk gritting his teeth. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could stand it no longer, went in long</seg><seg type="columnLine">strides toward the door--and at that mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment the door slammed open, and Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin stood on the threshold, breathing big</seg><seg type="columnLine">with excitement and triumph, plainly visi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble against the light inside the Greenies*</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE-SHIP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the first renewed breath of smoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fell to choking, swore aggrievedly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the door halfway. After he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped choking, his triumphant voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">came:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The fool! The soft, stupid fool! Stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, men; believe me, I'll take you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">heights Hawk never dreamed of. Once we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have enough money, we'll be able to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ways of God.

They'll more or less clear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke and leave us a path of oxygen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel through. Between you and I, Hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't have the guts to shoot a Greenie."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He chuckled.

The watch was going--wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">through habit every twenty-four hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though that was but a third of a day, here</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Venus.

They seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">attracted to it, was all. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, so far as he could tell--no ears. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things had senses, they were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like terrestrial senses. But the teardrops</seg><seg type="columnLine">did have an attitude of attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> George removed his watch, laid it before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Two teardrops detached themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the group to examine his right hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which he'd slipped off the wrist-band.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three others perched 011 the dust-covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck, the watch between them and him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> George flexed his right hand, twiddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers. The teardrops seemed unafraid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He chose one and lifted it. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">light in weight. Its star-foot was slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehensile, and grasped his glove with tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">claws arranged in rows on its bottom sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The claws seemed for clinging, not for</seg><seg type="columnLine">seizing. George put down the teardrop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned it over, and found no opening any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where on the surface. If these things lived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he decided, they must be plants, synthe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sizing their food--they had no way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat as animals do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vaguely, George made up his wavering</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind that the things existed outside his</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination. They were alive. They felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity about him. Leathery, he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">them--hard and smooth, except for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he set down the teardrop he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been examining, the three by his watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up a rhythmic motion. The center</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one stood in place, swaying slowly above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the watch like a bit of seaweed in a quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each of the other two had somehow ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained a pebble. They set their pebbles</seg><seg type="columnLine">down near the watch. Each then tapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a star-point, first at the pebble, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the watch. Back and forth they swayed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their motions synchronized--perhaps di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected by the center one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Interesting--but meaningless. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally meaningless when the two tear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drops at his right began to dance. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">found an empty food-can lid, pushed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">near his hand, and began a concerted sway-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and pointing that took them between</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and can.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Idly, George led the dance with a wag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled forefinger. The teardrops promptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed their motion.

But if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved his finger slowly enough, they kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dance at the watch had stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many teardrops gathered around the pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">that followed the beat of his right index</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It must have amused them. But it soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired George. He stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He needed all his remaining energy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think with. He knew these teardrops were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentient. They were curious, they com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municated with each other, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced. They had minds, therefore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GEORGE remembered hearing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man had danced even before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned to speak, in a primitive effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">express his feelings. He knew some birds</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance, too--as a courtship procedure. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects, even.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But why did the teardrops dance?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was the significance of rhythmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion between a pebble and a watch?

What did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pebbles mean?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pebble was a native object, known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be lifeless, inanimate. The watch was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange something that moved. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">can-lid did not move. The hand--gloved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">26	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">though they could not know that--was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">object that moved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dance was a question, therefore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alive, or dead? The teardrops wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. Is the watch that moves by itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive? The strangely symmetrical lid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a can, is it alive ? The oddshaped hand ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These teardrops had good minds--</seg><seg type="columnLine">could grasp abstractions. In a sense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">George felt, the difference between ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate and inanimate objects is an abstrac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. In his dying stale, the notion amused</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smiling, he placed a pebble on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch, another on the lid. He sat up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved his weakened body so they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps tell it was a unit. He picked up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">teardrop in each hand, held them at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">visor, rolled his eyes, and opened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut his mouth. He spoke to them. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sang to them. He swayed with them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show he too could dance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They made no sign of reply. None that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could recognize, at any rate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carefully he felt and looked at the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire surface of a teardrop, putting one</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to devote both hands to the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thought perhaps the lack of organs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings might simply mean they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothed or armored in some way. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing was apparently naked. The sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces he touched were probably skin. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And they, would they know what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was? Were they even certain he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of them was behind him, dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the tent. Seeing that, he was cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain the teardrops hadn't yet distinguished</seg><seg type="columnLine">the animate from the inanimate in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects around them here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And George had little time to teach</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.

Dead in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grotesque space-suit. Preserved in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere of formaldehyde. His body</seg><seg type="columnLine">would seem like a machine that had run</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. There would be no discernable</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference between himself and his watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if they knew he'd been alive? They</seg><seg type="columnLine">might remember, then. They were intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent, could communicate with one another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By rights they should have some kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of legends or traditions or history. If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did, if they knew they'd seen alien life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd keep the memory alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They'd recognize the next man to land</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Venus, might find means to tell of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">first expedition.

But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she came close to the doorway, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer possible to doubt, and a chill</seg><seg type="columnLine">went through her at the thought of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature panting eagerly on the other side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now she could hear it whine, and, despite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her knowledge that the gesture was an idle</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, she could not help once more feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bolt behind the door. Then she made</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that the shutters too were securely</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred, although these were usually in less</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger; most of the animals could not ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply pressure very far above the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Small was staring at her, not particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened, but very much interested.

Ordinarily, there was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing timid or fragile about her, or she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never have accompanied her hus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">band to Mars; but all the same, she felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak and helpless before the danger that</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened. And she shuddered as her five-</seg><seg type="columnLine">year-old son asked, "Can it get in, Mom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope not, darling.

"Don't talk about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it," she said, and carried him quickly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next room. When the door was bolted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she pressed the contact button, asked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Kidd, and almost at once was speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to Anthony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He listened quietly, his dark face in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">visor as grave as if he were concerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with some problem of engineering, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then said in a tone of reassurance, "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry, it carf't get in.

In the room where she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, she could no longer hear the straining</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal, but she knew that it hadn't gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. She tried to get interested in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Small's childish treasures. The blocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had long outgrown, and they kept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things only because there was no one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give them to, and it seemed silly to throw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">anything away here. Besides, Alice had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea that her son might have a brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a sister some day soon, if they ever de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided it was possible to raise a baby here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and toys were difficult to import. As for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Small's magic hypno-ray ring, his imita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion teleport bracelet, and his genuine imi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation home teleset and similar objects,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all obtained either by sending away one</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter credit in stamps plus a cereal box-</seg><seg type="columnLine">top or by selling a special perfumed soap</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his neighbors--which in this case meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">his parents--she had always found it diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult to arouse any interest in them. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, in fact, been slightly annoyed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anthony's indulgence of his son's desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to obtain them. And it was impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">simulate interest now, with that animal at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, suddenly, the animal wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">there any longer. She didn't hear any noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Anthony's gun. It wasn't that kind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She felt simply the shock of contact as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the missile went through the creature's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body and shook the house. Then came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, despairing chorus of yells, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, for a moment, silence. She withdrew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bolt of the connecting door, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buzzer sounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Anthony came in, she fell into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms. Small, however, wasn't having</seg><seg type="columnLine">any emotional excitement. He said, "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">was it, Daddy? Was it really a badgerine?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not this time, son. Just an octerocap."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"As if the other wasn't bad enough,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Alice faintly. The octerocap was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight-headed wolf, and was as likely to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">newcomers by the fright its appearance in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced as much as by its numerous teeth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Anthony, you must simply get me another</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun like yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can take mine if you really feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsafe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know I wouldn't take it.

"Do you think I don't realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?

Operations have been drag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging along at half of capacity because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">says we haven't filled out the necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms for those spare parts we need.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And we can't fill them out, because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms have to be countersigned by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vice-president in charge of Operation M54,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that gentleman is vacationing some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in space with a new bride, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't be located. So you see, darling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're cursing him in good company."</seg><seg type="columnLine">.Even at that, as Anthony might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out, he was suppressing a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of what might have been said of Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tapling. At the mines where Anthony and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fellow engineers worked, everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">was completely automatic, and. the dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were needed only for checking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">repairs. It was T. I. Tapling who had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">his best to ruin their lives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE HOUSES he had ordered built</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them were not too bad. To be rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonably invulnerable to the drill-toothed</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals who abounded on these wastes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls would have had to be about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen feet thick; and Tapling had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no grounds for suspecting that fact, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not been in any of the reports he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">read. But it was unquestionably his fault</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the houses were so widely scattered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dealing with a planet where the sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">was weak and ultra-violet was obtained</seg><seg type="columnLine">chiefly from artificial radiation, a planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the air was so cold that no one went</seg><seg type="columnLine">outdoors unless he had to, T. I. Tapling</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been worried about living space and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had generously allotted to each engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his family territory uninhabited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of miles in every direction. Possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bly he expected them to grow vegetables</seg><seg type="columnLine">next to their houses. Apparently he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no suspicion that he was making things</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as easy as possible for the predatory ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And of all locations, Anthony and Alice</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the worst. Their house was most iso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated, was the most difficult to get to from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office, and was in the part of the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try most liable to attack. It was little won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der that Alice said, as she had said so</seg><seg type="columnLine">often before, "But we must do something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you think we could have an electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier set up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We could not.

When the repairs to the door had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been completed, he said, as if continuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a conversation that had been going on all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time, "Are we getting the dog soon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daddy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think we are, Small.

But for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, the creature outside seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have trouble making up its mind. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratching stopped, and then began again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at another shutter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As long as it isn't at the door, I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance to slip out before it can slip in--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hope," said Anthony.

Here I go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened the door and stepped out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the faint sound the door made, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratching at the shutter stopped. A second</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, something seemed to flash through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air and throw itself at Anthony's face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anthony, startled, didn't pull the trigger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead, he swung the gun upward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the creature in the middle, throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it above the roof. As it rose high, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimed, giving it a wide beam. The creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">split in two and the pieces fell to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, where they wriggled spasmodic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THING had possessed a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake's head and neck on a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">pseudo-mammalian body. Anthony's shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">had cut it at the base of the neck, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyes glared at him, he fired into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. But even with the head shattered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neck continued to twitch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alice shuddered. "How did it fly?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get a little closer, and you'll see for</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself."	*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She managed to overcome her repulsion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and approached close, still holding her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun in readiness. And then, as Anthony</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said, she savr for herself. All along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck were small pairs of wings, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body two pairs of large ones. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were folded now, but their nature was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly visible. As if to leave her in no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt whatever, during one of the twitell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings a pair on the body shuddered open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and revealed a five-foot wingspread before</seg><seg type="columnLine">it closed again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's get into the house before we talk,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied Anthony, and they withdrew quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly and were about to bolt the door once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment, Alice looked around</seg><seg type="columnLine">and screamed. "Small!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anthony opened the door again, to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Small had slipped out and was poking</seg><seg type="columnLine">with interest in his mind and a stick in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand at the body-half of the shattered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">animal. Anthony grabbed him and carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in. When they had bolted the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, Alice fell into a chair. "That child</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives me heart-failure a dozen times a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's what kids are for," said Ant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hony. "About that thing I killed--I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of them, but I've never seen one be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. I hope they don't turn out to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">common around here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If one finally found its way to us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">others will, sooner or later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid so," he sighed. "They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">known as 'snaffles'--flying snakes. It may</seg><seg type="columnLine">make you feel better to learn that they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">not poisonous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It doesn't make me feel better in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least. They're horrible anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, how about getting a dog?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Send away for one--at once. Any kind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so long as it will kill these terrible things."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They sent away, and then they waited.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A week later, Anthony killed a badgerine</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a vicious, burrowing animal that had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit of slaughtering for the pure joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of killing. The same day, a report came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from T. I. Tapling to the effect that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Central Terrestrial Dog Breeding Station</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reported an order for one of their ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals, and that, by virture of the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all orders for Government personnel on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government projects must be routed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Government channels, the order</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been turned over to Mr. Tapling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, as Mr. Tapling was strongly op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to red tape--so said Mr. Tapling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black on white--he would not return a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new blank order form to Mr. Anthony</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kidd, but would save time, according to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the procedure permitted by Regulation</seg><seg type="columnLine">MN37VX25, Code 2, and fill out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary form himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, the guy's human," said Anthony</seg><seg type="columnLine">in surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe he had a dog himself once,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested Alice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whatever it is, it shouldn't be long</seg><seg type="columnLine">now,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Mr. Tapling, as an expediter, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not quite as efficient as when he played</seg><seg type="columnLine">the role of obstructor. Another week pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sed, during which	V&amp;A&amp; "ittathtet</seg><seg type="columnLine">octerocap and two snaffles, incurring a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight wound from one of the latter. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">32	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wound showed signs, at first, of festering</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly, and special biostatic treatment was</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed to keep it from getting worse. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">week after that, Anthony shot a new ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal which he had never even heard de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed before. It seemed a baggy formless</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, with a tiny, almost invisible head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tossed it aside, and the other animals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enticed by the meal, came to eat it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then prowl, audibly drooling, around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. He shot several more, and still no</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spent part of his hard-earned salary</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a special cable to Mr. Tapling, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gentleman, in his hatred of red tape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">referred the message to a subordinate, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed it on for action to a subordinate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own. Anthony never heard of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the next week he killed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than five different animals. Alice</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself killed a snaffle which tried to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the house through an imperfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred window. The explosive gun was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great success, blowing head and most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neck to bits with one shot, and knock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Alice to the floor at the same time by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of the recoil. She was bruised for</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, and from that moment she lived in</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as great terror of the gun itself as</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the animals outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the month that followed, Anthony</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent a cable each week, and received no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply to any of them. The number of ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals that prowled around the house in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased almost daily. There came the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Alice called up the mine in panic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anthony, there are three of them out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the house, all at once. One at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, two at different shutters. Rush home!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And bring help!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Okay/5 said Anthony, and rushed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time he was accompanied by one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his fellow engineers, who was carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">a surprise for Alice. The first surprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, was the one that Anthony him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self received. Tunneling under the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crete foundation of the house was a bad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerine whose presence Alice had not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspected. But Anthony had no time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tackle it, for the other animals were quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly upon him. The first to arrive were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snaffles, and both Anthony and the en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">8TORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gineer with him aimed and shot in a hurry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anthony's target fell apart as scheduled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The engineer's kept on coming, but for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately overshot its mark, for its intend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed victim had fallen to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anthony swung his gun around, knock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the snaffle into the air, and fired right</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the middle of an octerocap rushing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. It fell to the ground, eight heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">howling, and then managed to lift itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spring. But by this time the engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on his feet again, and while he broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">its back with a blow of his own gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anthony disposed of the remaining snaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only then that they heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shriek from inside. The badgerine was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting through the concrete and getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the house. Anthony rushed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. It was bolted; and Alice, terrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she watched the floor give way, either</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't hear his yells or was unable to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. Anthony wasted no time in pound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the closed door. He rushed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole the badgerine had dug and Crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down after it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hole was dark, but fortunately fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly wide, as the badgerine was a large ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal. Anthony was able to pull himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">along at a fair rate of speed. While he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still a dozen feet from the concrete, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the explosive gun go off. He almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the shock that must have hit Alice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to crawl faster, but only scraped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face against the rock. Actually, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few seconds before he reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">concrete and dragged himself through, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed like hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alice had turned on the brightest lights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, thoroughly shaken by the recoil, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now trying to aim with an unsteady gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the badgerine, which had pulled itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">together as if gathering strength to spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her. The explosion had torn a hole in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its side, and blood was staining the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but it wasn't the wound that had saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alice from its first attempt to pounce up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her. It was the bright light, which daz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled the eyes so well adjusted to.the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tunnel. It had leaped by odor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed, and Alice had been cool enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold her fire until she could aim. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time the animal would not miss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It sprang, in fact, just as Anthony drag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">MONSTER	33</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ged his own gun to aiming position, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its teeth were about to close on her throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his blast drilled it through the pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mary heart. Even as it fell, it knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ANTHONY kicked the animal aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">and picked up his wife, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fainted. Outside, the man who had ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">companied him was pounding on the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From behind the bolted door of the inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, Small was wailing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anthony deposited his wife gently on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sofa, and let his friend in. The man said</seg><seg type="columnLine">J&gt;itterly, "That Idiot Tapling."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind Tapling. Let me have your</seg><seg type="columnLine">flask."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Alice didn't need the whisky to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vive. She opened her eyes just as Anthony</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted her again, and then, as her gaze met</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own, she sighed. "What a wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">man I married. Always just in time."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That Idiot Tapling," growled the new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alice looked at him questioningly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anthony said, "This is Carl Dowley.

She might stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with the explosive gun, and she might</seg><seg type="columnLine">not. And then, if another showed up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same window or door, while she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still unsteady from the recoil . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her only hope was that they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come after her one by one, not too close</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. She considered seriously the pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility of opening the shutter to allow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance of the snaffle which she was sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tearing at it, getting rid of that, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then closing the shutter again while she</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovered her steadiness. But she knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the thing might come at her faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">than she could handle it, and decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the shutter alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For another half hour the animals work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed away, each intent upon its own means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of arriving at the victim. Then, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time, Alice heard the sound of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle between animals outside the house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The scratching at the shutter stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came a thin shriek, a crash against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side, and then silence except for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration of the shutter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scratching at the door stopped next.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time there came the howling of oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terocap heads, and then a crash high up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if the creature had been hurled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">great force against the house. The thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had hurled it next pounded on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, and to her horror Alice saw the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">yield at the same time both at the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom and at the top, as if it had been hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">J&gt;y both head and foot at once. Never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">before had any animal been large enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accomplish such a feat. This must be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">predator of a new type, huger and stronger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the second time in two days, Alice!</seg><seg type="columnLine">fainted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE WAS AWAKENED a little later</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a great pounding on the door. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first she thought she would faint again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the unexpected sound of Anthony's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice reassured her. He was yelling to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to open up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She lifted the bolt, and Anthony step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped toward her. As she fell forward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fling her arms around his neck, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she caught sight of something over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder . . . she closed her eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take it easy," said Anthony. "He may</seg><seg type="columnLine">look frightening, but he's of a breed that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been trained to be gentle with humans."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the thing that smashed the snaffle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trampled the octerocap.

It gazed at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">with saucer eyes, and then, as Small came</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it, his own little eyes wide with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a puzzled sort of delight, the dog stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a tongue bigger than Small's head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to lick Small's face. The boy fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">over backward, squalling in fright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Rover!" said Anthony sternly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dog hung its head in shame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Down, Rover!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dog stood motionless, Anthony*</seg><seg type="columnLine">smacked him on the rear.

He may look like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a monster, but he wouldn't lay a paw or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tooth on a human being.

Fact is, I was careless," con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessed Anthony shamefacedly. "I stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to light a cigaret, and he tugged the leash</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of my hand before I could get a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip on it. He headed for this place be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it was the only human-looking habi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation in the neighborhood. Good thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. He got here in time to take care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those creatures."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alice stared at the monster. "Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens, how big is he, anyway?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seven feet at the shoulder, and weighs</seg><seg type="columnLine">2000 pounds.

But like everyone else, she had read</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him while the war was on. A man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated his life as a millionaire might treat</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dime he found in his shoe. It wasn't that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was lucky, or so clever that the dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers were always less real than they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed.

She had read that he had come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an orphanage, even a hint that he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a reform school. But details like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't publicized about a hero.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't that, she decided. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside her was passionately fond of life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She could see it in the way his whole body</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated on the job in hand. He wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to save her and the others. If that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the case he would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold and steady. He was trying to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself--and the rest of them as a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterthought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook himself suddenly and turrted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the window. "It'll be a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet," he said, "and if I watch much longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll get jumpy and ring for the jets too</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon. You wouldn't like to do a strip</seg><seg type="columnLine">act to pass the time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's not at all funny," she said cool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. He watched her broodingly and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">she thought less of him than she had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment before. It was that easy to lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration and respect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was a tough-looking girl, workman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like rather than pretty. But she was suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciently versatile to make herself attractive</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, for no more reason, perhaps, than</seg><seg type="columnLine">VENUS MISSION	39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the man who doesn't intend to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">out or see anyone but still shaves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushes his hair. She wore dark slacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a heavy blue shirt, and though her</seg><seg type="columnLine">outfit didn't suggest any particular beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of figure, it didn't absolutely deny it. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had light brown hair and a strong, young</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. The features were good, and if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were too full of character for beauty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were just right for a certain subtle</seg><seg type="columnLine">elegance. It was a pity to see a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that die. There weren't too many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''What do you do?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've done a lot of things. At the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment I'm on Government work."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Which government?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "UNO. There's nothing secret about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I'm ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She broke off as Warrei; turned back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the window. "I'm beginning to get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling about this," he murmured. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be somewhere over the Norman</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forest. But we were slanting a long time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think we almost hit an orbit. Maybe we</seg><seg type="columnLine">overshot to the Norman Hills. In which</seg><seg type="columnLine">case--" his voice sank to nothing--"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should sound the alarm now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Virginia wasn't prepared. Her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted to Warren's hand, pressing hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the button, then flashed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, where there was a sudden break</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the grey mist, a blinding flash, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of a whirling black mass outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the floor kicked up at her. She realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that by luck or divination Warren had</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked on the right split-second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CRASH dazed her, but she never</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost consciousness. Warren did. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him shoot forward toward the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow and caught him by one ankle. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't stop him, but he crashed against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quartz with less force. Virginia heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scream of metal on stone that mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">until her ears refused to take it, and told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her nothing more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then gradually she realized that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was down, probably as safely as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have been. She looked out, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing but grey mist and black</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil. She had been on Venus before, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">never out in the open, only in the domed</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities. Nevertheless, she knew it was full</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">day. There was about as much light as</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a misty moonlit night on Earth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">visibility was about forty yards, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as light as it ever was on Venus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warren was stirring. He wakened as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she expected him to waken, quietly, doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing until he had had a look around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You stopped me crashing through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window," he said. "I'll do something for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you sometime."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've done it. You got us down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose unsteadily. "We'd better let</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others out," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By tacit agreement they looked for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain first. But he, the second officer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and any other members of the crew who</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't actually been dead before the land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing were crushed in a flat envelope of steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had once been the drive room. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't get near them, which was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps just as well. They made their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the store-room and unlocked the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It hadn't been a bad landing, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances. There had been fifteen peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple in the room, and seven of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still alive, though two would never recover</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness. As it happened, they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been safer in the nose with Warren</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Virginia, but no one could have known</seg><seg type="columnLine">that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warren took stock of them, ignoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moans and screams. He ignored the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead too. If they were dead, it didn't mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter whether they were unmarked or a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gusting pulp. It was the living who mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered. Waters, the actor, was bleeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">from mouth and ears in a way that showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was still alive. His wife was breathing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was rather horrible, for her neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">was obviously broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE OTHER FIVE were almost un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt. Fortunately the doctor, Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liamson, was on his feet and looked sane</seg><seg type="columnLine">and well. Standing beside him, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">only dazed, was old Martin, wiio was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety and had come through the crash</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as anyone. Three others were stir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring on the floor, and Smith, with a broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist, seemed to be the most seriously in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jured, though it was the women who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing most of the screaming and moan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Martin could hardly be blamed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">40	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for like most of those in the room she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lost some of her clothes in a blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of air which must have swept the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was probably screaming more at find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing herself half-naked in company at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">age of seventy-five than anything else. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Glamour Girl, whose name Warren</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know, was screaming only because</seg><seg type="columnLine">she always screamed when anything hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. Warren had met girls like her</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, and had not been impressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the evidence of a blast of air War-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ren looked round quickly and sniffed. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship was airtight. There was no hiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">of escaping air, and the pressure was high</seg><seg type="columnLine">--too high, if anything. Perhaps there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a rift which had immediately been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sealed by the weight and momentum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship. There were cracks and holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the inner walls, but they were not as</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong as the hull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, doctor?'' he asked. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">take over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doesn't look as if there's much I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">do." said Williamson wryly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be modest," Warren said. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor stared blankly, and Virginia shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quick glance at Warren. He had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in her estimation again, he decided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Glamour was tugging at his lapel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming: "Get me out of here! Get me</seg><seg type="columnLine">out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Into the open?" he asked coolly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'd die in eight hours. But long be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore that the Greys would have got you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She hadn't heard him. She was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming, "Get me out of here!" Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress had a spectacular plunging neckline</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if rent open by the blast, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural. Her hair wasn't even dishevelled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was completely unmarked and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful, which was a pity, Warren</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, for she didn't deserve to be. Bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter people had died in the crash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Virginia pulled her gently away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "You said something about the Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Hills. Do you know where we are?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's only a guess," he admitted, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think I do. Almost exactly, if I'm any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where near right at all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How's that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're lying up a bare slope, on soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil. But we hit rock first, and if we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down roughly straight we just missed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest. That puts us somewhere on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow belt twenty to thirty miles from</seg><seg type="columnLine">City Four--Cefor for short"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And how are our chances?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked round at the others, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent and hanging on his words, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glamour and Mrs. Martin, whose husband</seg><seg type="columnLine">had wrapped her in his jacket. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no point in letting it out slowly. Might as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well get it over with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our chances must be better now than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were when we were coming down,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said deliberately. "But you'd need a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slide-rule and a lot of figures to prove it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was a moment's silence while</seg><seg type="columnLine">they worked out his meaning. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glamour threw herself at him, screaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scratching at his face, as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">personally were responsible for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">plight. _</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Virginia seized his arm as he was fend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Glamour off, none too gently, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled him away. "Let's go and check</seg><seg type="columnLine">up," she said. He grinned. Her opinion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him might be dropping, and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably drop more very soon, but after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all he was the only one with whom she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could talk seriously. The safety of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all depended on him and her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She led him back to the observation</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It can't be as bad as you made out,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely they must have seen us come</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. There's bound to be a search. Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">at worst, surely one of us can get through</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it's only twenty miles."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not just deliberately being pessimis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic," he said. "I want to live too. But let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it from the beginning. The captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">would corroborate if he were here. One,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they couldn't see us in Cefor. We didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">come over it, we were pointing roughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it. And they couldn't see a flam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing meteor at five miles, let alone us at</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty. Radar doesn't work in this soup</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more than in water. And a seismo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph wouldn't help because there are so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many quakes on Venus no one will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">even interested in the shock we made on</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two, we were bound for New Paris</seg><seg type="columnLine">VENUS MISSION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the other hemisphere of Venus, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a search starts in about twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hours from now they'll concentrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">around there first. At a rough guess it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be six months before they find this ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remember, they've got to explore almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">every inch of ground. A helicopter has to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be within a stonesthrow before it can see</seg><seg type="columnLine">us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl stared. "But any time there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a forced landing the passengers are picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up before there's any real danger--even</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the ship is breached and they have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe that poison outside. I always</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought the only danger was getting down</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Warren gently, "usually.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But usually the radio doesn't crack up</seg><seg type="columnLine">first--before the ship. Ours did. So no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one knows where we are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh. I see. But we can't wait six</seg><seg type="columnLine">months. We'll all be dead in a week. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">don-'t carry much in the way of stores</seg><seg type="columnLine">on these ships."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded. "That's about the size of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shrugged. "Well, we just have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get on the way to Cefor, then." •&gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not me. If I'm going to die, I'll die</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shot a puzzled glance at him. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't understand you. You used to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hero. You've done harder things than this</seg><seg type="columnLine">trek to Cefor. You got medals for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE SMILED BLEAKLY. "No, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't understand. I told you I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no hero. Before the war I was nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody. I'd tried a few things and failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in them all. I tried crime two or three</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, and failed in that too. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">war started I realized it was my last</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. In peace I had nothing to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to but starvation or jail. So I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought I'd buy me a job. I became a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessional hero. I didn't give a damn if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">died. But if I got through I was pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of some sort of job. Civilians aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">grateful for long, but a collection of every</seg><seg type="columnLine">medal they mint ought to be a recommen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dation just after the war, I thought. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was right. I had my choice of jobs. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined an importing firm and I've done</seg><seg type="columnLine">well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was a hero once, but that was when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had to risk my life to buy a life worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">living. I bought it and paid for it. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you gamble like that, you do it only</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. I'm not going to throw away all I</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked for trying to get through to Cefor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sure, I know the Greys. I beat them be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. But that was then. Now I'd rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay here and take my chance of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescued than give them another crack at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked steadily at him for a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Then she shook her head. "Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm wrong to say it," she murmured, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you weren't twisted before. You're only</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted now. You've gone soft."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure I've gone soft. I risked my life</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and again so that one day I'd have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to go soft."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, if you won't go, I must."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shrugged his shoulders. "Please</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She made a gesture of disgust. "Heaven</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows I never thought I'd appeal to chiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alry. I never cried off or made excuses</seg><seg type="columnLine">because I'm a woman. But--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It doesn't matter. The Greys will get</seg><seg type="columnLine">whoever tries it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought the war was over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure it is. But out there you won't find</seg><seg type="columnLine">the civilized Greys. The Greys who will</seg><seg type="columnLine">get you never signed any treaty.

"I might as well go now."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warren watched her as she shook out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plastic envelope, obviously unfamiliar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her, and tried to climb into it. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he put his hand on her arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't let you go without telling you</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly why you shouldn't," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook his arm off and struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the suit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "First of all, though it's only a detail,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remarked, "you don't wear heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes under that. You'd sweat off pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">before you'd gone a hundred yards. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us used to wear nothing but the suit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but if you don't like that, wear something</seg><seg type="columnLine">light and loose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She began to take off the suit again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'll have no difficulty in finding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city ~' he said. "It's right up the hill. Keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">42	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> on the incline and you can't go wrong. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> you have to make a detour, just get back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> on the slope as soon as you can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He paused. "You'll have even less diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty in finding the Greys"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE WAITED for him to go on, hat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him but utterly dependent on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of Venus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No native Venusians have any sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smell," he said. "So to replace scent</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hunting they have a sense that feels</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw 'her start, and grinned. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">can locate anything that thinks. They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">not telepaths. They don't know what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, any more than dogs hearing voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what's being said. They just know</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's thinking going on in such-and-such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a direction, and from the kind of thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">they know the kind of creature that's doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. So it doesn't matter what you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, they'll pick you up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled again, cruelly, she thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When they do find you, 'they won't kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">you right away.

But they'll let you get</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to the gates of Cefor. Ever seen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat torturing a mouse? The Greys are</seg><seg type="columnLine">just like that. At the very last minute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you think you're safe, they'll drag</seg><seg type="columnLine">you off into the forest and torture you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. Maybe they'll let you escape two</seg><seg type="columnLine">or three times. But at last they'll tire.''</seg><seg type="columnLine">She twisted from him angrily, certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had heard all that would be of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">use to her. She left the room to go to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin and change her clothes. But as</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently as a cat he had followed her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen carefully to what happens then,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "for it's very important."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She tried to pass him, but he leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one arm on either side of her, hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her against the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They won't let you die. They'll muti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late you with their knives so that you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound to die, so that the best doctors on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth, Venus and Mars couldn't save you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that you're in agony but will still live</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a while. Then they'll take you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest city--in this case, Cefor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'll leave you there. It amuses them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that we humans don't kill our own people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even when they want to die. You'll die</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hospital bed, heavily drugged but still</seg><seg type="columnLine">not enough to stop all the pain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He let her go, for she was listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, in horrified fascination. "But that</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't important," he said casually. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">is important is that you can tell them about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. We'll all be grateful to you. We may</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect a statue to you. You'll die, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying you can save us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and left her then. She stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him in horror, her horror for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greys a little less strong than her horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ARREN WAS WAITING at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airlock as she came back. He grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her. She was almost literally sick. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst of it was that he was almost certain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly right. She had to make the effort, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one else would make it. He knew that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could afford to let her do it. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be saved. She would tell them at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cefor about the ship. He wasn't alone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were other lives to be saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warren surveyed her and nodded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're all right," he said. "Can you use</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gun?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded involuntarily. "Take an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other," he said. "They won't give you</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to reload." He gave her a gun, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she slipped in her belt. She had changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into lounging pajamas which were en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloping but so thin she shivered in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal temperature of the ship. Over</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the plastic suit covered her loosely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely, held firmly by the belt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained her weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unwillingly she addressed him. "Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there no way of screening thoughts from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Greys?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only by thinking like a Grey yourself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only about half a dozen people ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned to do it--and they can't keep it up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She fought a shrieking urge in her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">beg him to go instead of her. She believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">all he had said--she expected to die. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">she also believed that if she stayed where</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was, she would die. No one else would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">go-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good luck," said Warren.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blindly, insanely she struck at him. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">VENUS MISSION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ho evaded her blow and helped her into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the airlock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she went out, the heat met her</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if an oven door had been swung open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ship's hull was insulated against both</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold and heat. Usually it was cold it kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, but on Venus it was damp warmth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Virginia's suit was supposed to afford</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of insulation, but before she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight of the ship she was wet all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over with sweat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She took one last look at the ship as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she climbed up the slope. It was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty yards away. She could still turn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back. She was beginning to realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that stemmed from what War-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ren had said. She could always find Cefor</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but she couldn't find the ship again</seg><seg type="columnLine">once she lost sight of it. Going downhill</seg><seg type="columnLine">might land her anywhere along the perim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eter once she had lost all sense of direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion,--which would be almost at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She tried to think calmly of Warren. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have known from the first that if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't try to get through to Cefor, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would. She wasn't the sort to sit still and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the savage, inhuman customs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greys ensured that only one had to go.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hate for Warren crawled in her stomach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The worst of it was, she believed he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have got through safe. She still believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his competence. Somehow, if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to, he would have reached safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he didn't have to risk it. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone to risk it for him. A girl, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that didn't matter to a man who had lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She walked on for what seemed hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until she was as wet as if she had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out of a hot bath. Her watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed sixty-three minutes since she left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship. She had been walking briskly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Over four miles. She had always been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good walker, and the slighter gravity</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then she struck the forest, beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">again on the slope. Venusian trees were</seg><seg type="columnLine">like those of Earth in that they consisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainly of a thick trunk, but that was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the resemblance. You could push an arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">through them, and they closed round it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they weren't dangerous. A man could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">walk right through them, if he was strong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Virginia began to hope, despite herself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she wouldn't see any Greys. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell into the rhythm of her stride, walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an automaton. She was tough. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do twenty miles without coming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of her strength. The only difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the eternal slope. But even that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">became accustomed to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had done ten miles, she reckoned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when ahead of her, right in her path, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a Grey. He was facing her, only twen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty yards away. Her gun came up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she fired, but she was not surprised when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he faded into the mist and disappeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unharmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO IT HAD STARTED. There would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a lot of this, according to Warren.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Greys were humanoid, like half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished men. They had no hair, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had arms, legs, feet, a trunk and a head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything about them was rounded off--</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders, thighs, feet. They were a uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form grey all over, and invisible on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own planet at anything more than twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards. They could be in plain sight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only had to turn or move back a step to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappear completely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She began to plan. Perhaps she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat them, on what Warren had told her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing mattered, apparently, until she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost at Cefor. She would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save herself till then. Greys could run a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little faster than most humans, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. And she used to be able to do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards in well under twelve sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds. Civilized Greys had civilized weap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ons, but these were probably unarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for knives. If she could pick her</seg><seg type="columnLine">time right for a dash to the city, she might</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She began to reel a little and slowed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace, knowing she was observed. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">she might trick them into leaving the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack till too late. She could rest a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. It was only the last mile that mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She staggered and fell. She rose slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in artistic fatigue. But she almost jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her sprint when she saw four Greys</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly watching her from only ten yards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shot rapidly, and one of them fell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The others didn't appear to care, But</seg><seg type="columnLine">44	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they disappeared, if only just beyond her</seg><seg type="columnLine">range of vision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She ran a little then, in terror that wa9</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a little less real than she pretended.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the control she still had on herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">enabled her to stumble on tiredly at hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than walking pace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her hopes were beginning to rise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twelve miles; she was still fresh; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Greys must think her almost out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her feet. They must let her see Cefor or</seg><seg type="columnLine">their devilish torture wouldn't be com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete. And if they let her get that far, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be able to dash for the gates and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then hold them off until men came out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">attracted by her shots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She pondered over firing early in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope that she would give the alarm. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost certainly that would precipitate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greys' attack, and she wanted to trick</seg><seg type="columnLine">them into leaving it until the last possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly something crashed between</seg><seg type="columnLine">her legs, throwing her headlong. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't hurt, but when she got up she</seg><seg type="columnLine">limped. They were playing into her hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warren had done this, she thought. Twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had escaped from the Greys. And per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps he hadn't known as much as she did</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They left her alone for quite a while.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She saw nothing of them for so long that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she almost began to hope that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired and left her alone. But she kept her</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow pace. They might be trying to trick</seg><seg type="columnLine">her into showing she was stronger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">she pretended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she least expected it she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowled over from behind and felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of warm, moist skin. She gave her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self up to terror and thought, This is it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they only rolled her about gently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">played with her, and tripped her again</seg><seg type="columnLine">every time she rose. There seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a dozen of them. She was afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">to try to shoot them. Her guns were</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure if she left them where they were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but if she drew one they might knock</seg><seg type="columnLine">it from her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last they were gone. They had torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">her suit, but only the pantaloon part. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was puzzled, then realized why. Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen she would die in eight hours, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be beyond recovery in six. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that, and they wanted her to live</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE CUT HER SUIT away at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist, below her belt. It left her legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">freer. Her thin slacks clung to her legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that by now they almost seemed a part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her. She wondered what they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">do if she threw away the rest of the suit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would they put it back on her forcibly?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She knew she must have done nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty miles, and wished Warren had</seg><seg type="columnLine">overestimated the distance. He had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty to thirty miles, and she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to prevent herself hoping it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller limit. But there was no sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cefor yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two of them would have had a much</seg><seg type="columnLine">better chance, she thought angrily. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have watched all round them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept the Greys more on the defensive. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was, the Greys were so silent that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">score of them could be walking only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few yards behind her. She resisted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptation to look until she was set to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it quickly, ready to take a shot at any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing she saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she had swung round she wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">she hadn't. At least a score of dark shapes</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded rapidly into the fog. Now 6he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would always know they were there be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind her, within sight if she turned her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. It was enough to drive her mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Greys could see only about thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">or forty yards--even less than she could.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the mist would only lift, she knew she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see them long before they could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. But the mist never lifted. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere of the planet. There was a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of oxygen in it, but there were other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things in it too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly she saw a faint glow ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She forced herself to be cold as ice. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright lights of the domed city would</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry a long way, even through the fog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It might be anything up to a mile distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, though probably not more than half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile. This was the time Warren had</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned her about The time when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to think she was through. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced herself to stumble slowly on. She .</seg><seg type="columnLine">nursed a faint hope that as the Greys {</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably couldn't actually see the city yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they would know where it was,;</seg><seg type="columnLine">VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MISSION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they might leave her alone for a while</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She went staggering on, thinking over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over again, Not yet! Not yet! as her</seg><seg type="columnLine">body rebelled and tried to run toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then she saw the Greys closing in. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly she was running, firing her gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she went. She didn't care where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets went. But she realized in rending</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointment that the mist blanketed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound as well as sight, and she was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">too far away for the sound to be heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Cefor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she was holding her lead! She went</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild with exultation and threw her empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun away. Even its weight held her back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as she raced toward the light she told</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself she had won. The Greys had un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derestimated her, as' she had been inviting</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to do for hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly she heard a scream behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. A woman's scream. It was so un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected that she checked her stride in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluntarily. She took it up again at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The scream was another of the Greys'</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it came again, and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. It was no Grey she heard. Behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, a human girl was screaming as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dragged down. Again Virginia</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't help checking her stride. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, furious with herself, she renewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her efforts. It must be Yvonne Yonge</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was screaming. Somehow, for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason, the little glamour girl had set out</seg><seg type="columnLine">after her. That was too bad. Virginia's</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty to herself, to the rest of them, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Yvonne, was to reach Cefor. She burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward as if she had merely been trot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting gently before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the Greys were at her heels. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">never knew whether she would have es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caped if Yvonne's scream hadn't checked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, or whether the Greys would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught her anyway. Either way, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE FOUGHT as she had never known</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could fight. As she had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">known anyone could fight. If there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only been ten of them, even twenty, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have broken free again and again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until at last she reached Cefor. But there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were scores of them, perhaps hundreds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When she broke from one group she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the middle of another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stopped fighting at last, thinking she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no strength left. But when they began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drag her away from the lights of Cefor</seg><seg type="columnLine">she found a reserve of strength that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't known about. It made no differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She didn't see Yvonne, if it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yvonne. She was dragged for what seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles. The Greys were very gentle with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. They took all she was able to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">them rather than scratch her skin. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">they folded her up at the foot of a tree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding her so that she went down easily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally. Then they tied vines about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Virginia half hoped, half</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared that they were going to throttle</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. But instead they wound the rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her throat, holding her plastic suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight against her skin. Then they cut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit neatly below the rope, fastened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plastic edge firmly against her skin with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an adhesive binding, and removed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Obviously they wanted her to go on</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing through the filter in her hood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but to have the rest of her accessible. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached over her and she flinched, expect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them to strip her, but they only tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands and ankles and patted her all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, making sure she had no concealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they left her. In a moment there</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't a Grey in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was helpless even to damage her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. She could roll on her side and rub</seg><seg type="columnLine">her plastic hood on the ground in an effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tear it and let the poisonous air reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lungs--but that would take hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she didn't think she would be left</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone that long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't say I didn't warn you," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warren.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HER HEAD jerked up, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't see him. Then, fantastically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head appeared from the tree beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.

"Sorry, Virginia, it was the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">way it could be done. I've got the trick</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thinking like a Grey.

And if that little fool Glamour</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't interfered we'd both have got</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. I meant to get just ahead of you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, when the Greys finally decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take you, I'd llave helped you to cut and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot your way through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Glamour spoiled it.

Maybe she thought it was easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wanted some of the glory. Anyway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I didn't know about her until a few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes ago. She was behind us both.

He paused; went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on tensely. "They'll start torturing you</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon. That will occupy them.

Good luck--again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE FADED AWAY into the mist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Virginia stared after him, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could see nothing. If he had only told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her . . . But she realized he probably told</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth when he said he hadn't dared..</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knowing he was about, she would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been sure she would get through safely--</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she had hated him, she had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted his competence--and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greys would have caught them both.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was sound again in the silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mist. They were bringing in Yvonne</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Glamour, as Warren called her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shouting, kicking, clawing. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greys weren't handling her as gently as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had handled Virginia. Perhaps they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had some respect for courage, Virginia</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. She had never been in a blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">funk as Yvonne was. Maybe it was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of that that they had been gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And perhaps--she couldn't help think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of it--perhaps they would work on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yvonne first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed like a dream--not a night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mare yet, for the Greys looked ludicrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than dangerous. There were hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of them. They filled the clearing;</seg><seg type="columnLine">though Yvonne was only twenty yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, she might have been a million miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all that was visible of her. Virginia</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lifted to her feet by what seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a hundred hot, wet Greys, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they led her, still bound, to where she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had last seen Yvonne the whole thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed more a practical joke than any</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then abruptly it stopped being a prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical joke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had cut Yvonne's suit like hers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving nothing but the hood over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, fastened at the neck. Yvonne was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing a blouse and shorts and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the heroine of a jungle picture. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she saw Virginia she Med to get tip to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the Greys stopped that by pinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">(her to the ground with two knives through</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands. Her shriek went through Vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginia's head like a needle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four of the Greys held Virginia so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had to watch what was going on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She shut her eyes, but when Yvonne</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed again they had to come open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the Greys had shouted and danced and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat drums it would have been less hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible. But the only soimds were those f orced</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Yvonne. There were plenty of those.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To keep her sanity Virginia concentrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately on Warren, making his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Cefor. He needed time. Suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a long spell of relaxation., she flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself forward, tore free and pitched be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side Yvonne, who was still, she realized,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only mildly hurt beside what was to come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Warren's gone for help," she mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mured. "Hold out a little and he'll be back.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the Greys dragged Virginia to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet again Yvonne screamed wildly: "Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you leave her alone ? Why do you only</seg><seg type="columnLine">torture me? I can't take any more. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">can take it. She's strong. Please leave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. Please . . . a'ahhhh f*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shrieked again as a Grey bent over</seg><seg type="columnLine">(her with a knife. She wasn't screaming now</seg><seg type="columnLine">for nothing . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS ALMOST an hour later that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they brought Warren in. It had seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like days to Virginia and probably untold</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries to Yvonne. When she saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">being forced into the clearing by a mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of struggling Greys, Virginia stared in hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror. She had always believed he would get</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. The question had merely been</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether he would be in time. He wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at her. He stared impassively at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yvonne instead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They hadn't touched Virginia yet, beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">'holding her still--but it must be close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her time. If they weren't going to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yvonne die, they couldn't do much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her. There was very little blood. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greys had a herb that seemed to close the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin, though it left an angry purple dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coloration. Yvonne was almost all purple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MISSION	47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For some time she had had no strength to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream. The Greys were losing interest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Further torture had no noticeable ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect. She was conscious, but she didn't seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to feel f resh cuts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They must have had some invisible means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of communication among themselves. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, as if at a signal, they turned to Vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginia, and with a sick feeling at her stom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ach she knew her time had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I always wondered," said Warren cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iously, "what kind of figure you had."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, not being human, the Greys didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">strip her. They merely stretched her on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground and cut her bonds, waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to make a dash for it. That was part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Warren tore himself free. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of running from the clearing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw himself at Virginia. '"Play up," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">panted. "They won't know what to do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'll wait to see what happens. It will</seg><seg type="columnLine">amuse them to see us fighting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you did get through ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure I got through. I said I would*</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't I ? But we have to give them some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to think about. So that they won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense the men closing in. Fight, damn you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're not out of the wood yet. If we give</seg><seg type="columnLine">them time to think . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His breath left him in a gasp as Virginia's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard fist sank into his stomach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the Greys watched they fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their lives. But not against each other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though that was part of it. They didn't care</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they were hurt. If the fight was too tame</seg><seg type="columnLine">to excite the Greys they would be hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more. It meant nothing to the Greys</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were a man and a woman. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greys were monogeneous and had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite worked out the relationship of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Virginia's hood was torn, and she won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered if the Greys would stop the fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From then on she was breathing poison.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it didn't matter. She would either be</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe in six hours or as near dead as made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no difference. She tore off the hood alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether and threw it from her, jerking her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair back out of her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warren was grunting with pain more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than her blows deserved. It did occur to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Virginia once as he struck at her with feral</seg><seg type="columnLine">48	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">strength that perhaps he was hurting her</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than he need; but then she realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that as the Greys sensed fear they prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably sensed pain, and that that was at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">root of their inhuman sadism. After that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she didn't pull her punches either.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Warren, his fist drawn back to jab</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her ribs, swung at the nearest Grey in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead, knocked him spinning. The clearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was suddenly filled with men in tough plas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic suits. They didn't use guns, but long</seg><seg type="columnLine">knives. It was massacre, for the Greys'</seg><seg type="columnLine">knives couldn't pierce their suits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was massacre, and Virginia gladly</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped in it. The moist black ground ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">with blood, and none of it was red. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greys didn't run. Inflamed with bloodlust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they couldn't suddenly switch over to rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and to fear. They stood their ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were cut to pieces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      rELL, now you know the Greys/*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  VV said Warren.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were in a room, a civilized room in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a city again. There were deep carpets on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor and soft couches and armchairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Virginia had thrown herself in one of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still in her black suit. Her jacket was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a collar, there wasn't much left</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her slacks, and Warren was surveying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her at last with satisfied curiosity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smug satisfaction, but she didn't care.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Glamour's husband was in Cefor," War-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ren murmured.

He turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat down toward Bucktown, and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour later landed at his cabin beside Lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lenore.

The station</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its machinery and solid Earth-style</seg><seg type="columnLine">regulations projected reassurance, a sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of normality. Somehow the ingenuity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">aggressive attack which had taken men to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stars would solve the present enigma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Or would it?

And Kelly still had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own problem: the jewel.

In the vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the black-robed figure of a Han</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest moving across the open space be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the cabin, and he saw the flash of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dough-white face . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kelly turned a troubled glance up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big red sun, entered the station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The administration section was vacant;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kelly climbed the stair to the operation</seg><seg type="columnLine">department.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped in the doorway, surveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room.

Then the gray fortress of</seg><seg type="columnLine">North Settlement, and the dark temple</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the center.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KELLY dropped the air-car directly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the temple. No reason now</seg><seg type="columnLine">for stealth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He climbed to the ground, looked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the strange purple twilight which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to the ramshackle city.

There was no point in adding further</seg><seg type="columnLine">provocation to his offenses.

'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Hello," he called into the dark interior,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a voice he tried to keep firm.

Listening in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tently, he could hear a distant murmur.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took a few steps into the temple, peer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed up the nave. The muffled red and</seg><seg type="columnLine">green illumination confused rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">aided his vision.

He took a step</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward--another--another--he stepped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">something soft. There was the flash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white below him.

Ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the sheen of the tall black mirror,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there on the black cushion was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second jewel identical to the one he car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried. A Han priest stood like a ghost in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a black robe, he watched Kelly approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">without movement. Kelly laid the jewel on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cushion beside its twin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There it is. I've brought it back.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the priest at a point where a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw would be, felt a brittle crunch.

"Great God Han lives behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror, and moves planets for jewels.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed, might have fallen if gravity had</seg><seg type="columnLine">existed to pull him down. But there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no gravity.

The blood-sound rose and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his ears. Blood meant life. He was alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked in back of him, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurring of his eyes could not distinguish</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he saw.

"I will aid you. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lax your mind." Kelly, grasping at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">straw, loosened his mental fibers, and felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">something like a damp shadow entering</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain, absorbing, recording. . . . All</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an instant. The contact vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KELLY felt the Leader's mind waver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over in favor of Han.

"Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three trials," added Kelly. "In the story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man won and was pennitted to return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his native land. After this fashion let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me duel in three trials with Han."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The surge of thoughts thickened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air--rancorous contempt from Han, sly</seg><seg type="columnLine">encouragement from the Antagonist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">TEMPLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement from the Leader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You invoke a barbaric principle," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Leader.

"He who first arrives at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a solution wins the trial."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Han was scornfully silent. So the Lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er formulated a problem---a terrific state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment whose terms were dimensions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quasi-time and a dozen concepts which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kelly's brain could in no wise grasp.

A system</seg><seg type="columnLine">to integrate twenty-five different comuni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation bands into one channel was under</seg><seg type="columnLine">consideration, and it was necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust a beam of protons past a bank of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five mutually inter-acting magnets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hit a pin-point filter at the far end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case. The solution was simple enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a statement of the initial vector in terms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a coordinate equation and a voltage po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tential--yet the solution had occupied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">station calculator for two months. Kelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew this solution as he knew his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurry!" came the Antagonist's secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kelly blurted out the answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a wave of astonishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the group, and he felt their sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picious inspection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are quick indeed," said the Lead-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">©F HAN	63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">er, non-plussed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another problem," called the Antago-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nist.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time Kelly's mind worked faster. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately stated the answer. Still he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticipated Han by mere seconds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Han protested, "How could this small</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink brain move faster than my cosmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How is this ?" asked the Leader. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you calculate so swiftly?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Kelly fumbled for ideas, finally strung</seg><seg type="columnLine">together a lame statement: "I do not cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culate.

They move in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant, the problem is solved, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution comes to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Anxiously he waited, but the reply seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to satisfy the group. These creatures--</seg><seg type="columnLine">or gods, if such they were--were they so</seg><seg type="columnLine">naive? Only the Antagonist suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">complex motives. Han, Kelly sensed, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">old, of great force, of a hard and inflexible</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature. The Leader was venerable beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, calm and untroubled as space it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What now?" came from the Antago-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nist. "Shall there be another problem?

The thoughts of Han roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth almost like sound.

One of the towering shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrunk, condensed, swirled to a man-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape, solidified further, at last stood fac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Kelly, a thing like a man, glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a green phosphorescence like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of the Seven-year Eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">, The Antagonist's secret thought came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Kelly: "Seize the jewel at the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KELLY scanned the slowly advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure. It was exactly his height and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heft, naked, but radiating an inhuman</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence. The face was blurred, fuzzy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Kelly could never afterward describe</seg><seg type="columnLine">the countenance. He tore his gaze away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do we fight ?" he demanded, beads</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sweat dripping from his body. "Do we</seg><seg type="columnLine">set any rules^-or no holds barred?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tooth and nail," came the calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts of the Leader. "Han now has</seg><seg type="columnLine">organic sensibilities like yours. If you kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">this body, or render it unconscious, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">win.

Kelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a step backward, jabbed tentatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his left fist. Han rushed forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kelly punched furiously, kneed the on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing body, heard it grunt and fall, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap erect instantly. A tingle of joy ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">down Kelly's spine, and more confidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stepped forward, lashing out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights and lefts. Han leapt close and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinched his arms around Kelly's body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he began to squeeze, and Kelly felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a power greater than any man's in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">green-glowing arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The jewel," came a sly thought. Sparks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were exploding in Kelly's eyes; his ribs</seg><seg type="columnLine">creaked. He swung a frenzied hand, claw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at Han's neck. He felt a hard pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuberance, he dug his nails under, tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jewel free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shrill cry of utmost pain and horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and the god-man puffed away into black</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke which babbled in a frenzy back and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">forth through the darkness. It surged</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Kelly, arid little tendrils of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke seemed to pluck at the jewel clench-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed in his hand. But they had no great</seg><seg type="columnLine">force, and Kelly found he could repel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisps with the power of his own brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He suddenly understood the function of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jewel. It was the focus for the god. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">centralized the myriad forces. The jewel</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, the god was a welter of conflicting</seg><seg type="columnLine">volitions, vagrant impulses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kelly felt the Antagonist's triumphant</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts. And he himself felt an elation</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had never known before. The Leader's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool comment brought him back to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You seem to have won the contest."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a pause. "In the absence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposition we will render any requests you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may make." There was no concern in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts for the decentralized Han. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">black smoke was dissipating, Han was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a memory. "Already you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">delayed us long. We have the problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">of--" the now familiar confusion of ideas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this time Kelly understood vaguely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed that there was a vortex of uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verses which possessed consciousness, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty or mightier than these gods, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was driving on a course that would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">incommoding.

Evidently he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his way to extend his empire over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">third. The girl was probably his secre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dirk became aware suddenly that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl was watching him with dark-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement. He swung angrily on Jerry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Sanders, aren't you aware that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next watch is yours? If we rim into any</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble, you'll wish you'd had your sleep."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sanders flushed. "My off-watch time's</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, come now, don't be hard on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad," Stapledon protested.

Anyhow, what trouble could</seg><seg type="columnLine">we encounter out here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The questions seemed rhetorical; surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 'vision magnate knew all there was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know about Jason. "Knock off, Jerry,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dirk said. "You've got four hours left to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go, and "I don't relish the idea of a shaky</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand at the boards up front."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yessir," Sanders said sullenly. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious that he hated to be ordered to bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of the girl, but he had no choice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dirk watched him until his slender back</seg><seg type="columnLine">was framed against the glo-pup shimmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the levitator shaft; then he turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two passengers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry," he said. "But we're a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">on edge this trip. There's a lot at stake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If Jason's greed stops this third wave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">colonization, there may never be another;</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can't any of us afford a moment's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quite right, quite right," Stapledon</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "We appreciate the attention, Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">modore. Goodnight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goodnight," Dirk said through sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly clenched teeth. He turned his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on them and strode off. Just as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">entering the shaft, the girl laughed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">silvery sound cascaded through the dome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt himself flushing and cut off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft at B-Deck,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN CYGNl	75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT HAD BEEN nearly a century since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first interstellar passenger liner had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned back toward Earth, only a quarter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the way along toward Centaurus III,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a cargo of madness and death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had happened, according to the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">surviving crewmen, when the lights had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been turned off for the second Watch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dozens of learned tomes had been written</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it since then, but no-one had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten much beyond the simple facts: the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights had gone off, and the passengers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">rioted. There was something about being</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven between the stars at nine times</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed of light which was different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary interplantary flight: in a lightless</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin the darkness closed in, you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">horribly, uniquely alone, pitching headlong</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a pit of absolute emptiness . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps--just perhaps--that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way it was. Those who had come sane</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the first blackout could not. be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure; they had been lucky enough to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">on duty, near a source of light. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been in the cabins had gone mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a few moments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that, the switchless, inextinguish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able glo-pups had been installed by Act</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Council, and the General Orders on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blackouts had become a part of the Space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways Manual. There was even a glo-pup</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the head of every bed, next to the visi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tape screen, casting its dim radiance up</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the ceiling. On the ledge next to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pillow there was also a mask for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glo-pup, but most of the masks gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dirk stripped off his jacket, took off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoes and socks, and put the mask</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the light. He was as afraid of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interstellar pit as any spaceman, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sense enough to know that half his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear was of something he knew to be harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less while he was alone: the fear of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">other people might do while he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see them. On this flight, there was no tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing who or what might be watching wher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever there was light . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the stifling darkness he groped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his locker and spun the combination, work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with fingers which had often con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quered tougher puzzles than an ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage locker. Inside, behind his gaudy</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress-jacket, was a worn holster with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">76	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy cyclast in it. It was a tough star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's boast that he slept in the dark, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who was telling the truth had</seg><seg type="columnLine">little to fear from marauders -- it took</seg><seg type="columnLine">something more than guts to walk into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">totally black room out here--but Dirk</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept with the cyclast all the same. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no telling what was due to happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">this trip--•</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His fingers found the holster. The heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained, familiar weapon was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shock of surprise was doubled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">redoubled in the boundless gloom. Fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down his panic, he ran quick fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his jacket, along the floor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the locker. Gone, all right. Of course it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was illegal for an officer to maintain arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the ship's arsenal, but nobody on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge had any reason to be pawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Dirk's effects--■</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sanders ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ridiculous. Dirk had hardly spoken to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sanders until tonight. The fledgling re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentment the Third Mate might have felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">at being packed off to his crib couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have taken wing this quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. There was only one answer. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone on board the Telemachus who.</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an agent of Jason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dirk padded back to his bunk and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, rubbing the blond stubble on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin. It fitted; almost it seemed as if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted too patly to be true. After the Cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trale-Ganymede war, some units of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ganymedian Navy had been sold as sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plus to private firms, before the Centrale</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council could get a complete inventory of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it had won. Among the sold ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been several heavy sub-cruisers. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who called himself Jason had some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how had the liquid cash to buy one; he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned it to piracy, and had made a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of intercepting the big, clumsy liners</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the interstellar run--*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Except that a ship on overdrive was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to be indetectable. Every physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cist in the system swore that it was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to pirate a sub-ship, no matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">how big it was. So the obvious conclusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that the piracies had been inside jobs;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the theft of Dirk's cyclast, on this trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all trips, seemed to point the same way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Disgustedly, he reached for the glc-pup</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOFT KNOCK on the cabin door</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrested his hand in mid-air. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a kangaroo-shiv in the belt of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress jacket; but it was a duelling weapon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he decided against fighting ovei*</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door opened hesitantly. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. Modeled against the hazy glow, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was startlingly lovely. She peered help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly into the unexpected darkness, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand at her throat, one smooth knee bent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Phillips?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dirk's hand resumed its arrested arc,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the glo-pup once more stared inno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cently at the ceiling. He leaned on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbow and studied his visitor. He'd hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten a glance at her before--and she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to look at.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her hair was a waterfall of black silk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with blue highlights in it, and her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were violet and slightly slanted -- not</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to suggest the Oriental, yet giv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her face a piquancy that was hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">resist. The fashionable Centaurian toga,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its slit from waist to toe and its heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden shiv-chain locking the waist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have been tolerated on tabu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridden Earth--but then, there were few</seg><seg type="columnLine">women left on Earth who could wear such</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing successfully. The active, lithe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodied people who roamed the interstellar</seg><seg type="columnLine">frontier were almost a different race. Dirk</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed wryly that the shiv-chain wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty; the massive handle of the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself lay across one gently rounded hip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's me," he said, somewhat belated-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. Then, "You're armed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl bit her lip and reached for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasp of the golden chain. Dirk raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please don't. Those damned togas look</seg><seg type="columnLine">like nightgowns when they're unbound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'm not sure I could stand the shock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What do you want?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May I close the door?" she said stiffly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's your reputation, not mine. Get on</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it. Sanders may want to lose sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">off watch, but I don't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're very gracious," she said. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut the door and leaned against it, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands behind her back. "I'm Nadya</seg><seg type="columnLine">Storm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dirk's eyebrows shot up. "I wish I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLACKOUT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had a chance to look at the passenger list!</seg><seg type="columnLine">First Stapledon--and now the daughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Kurt Storm, top Centrale Council</seg><seg type="columnLine">woodenhead! And to think I took you for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Centaurian. I should have known better."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh?" Nadya said coldly. "Why?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Because the real Centaurians are down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Supercargo--not lolling around on D-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deck at two thousand per."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shrugged. "I'm going to Cygni for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same reason they are--to work. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering the colonization for ITN; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">D-Deck rooms were Mr. Stapledon's idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . but that doesn't matter. You seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be spoiling for a fight. If you can't stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">fencing, I'll take my questions to Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll get short shrift there, Staple-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don notwithstanding, I promise you." But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dirk relaxed a little. It was hard not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be curious over what had brought her here</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this hour, and harder still to resist the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer beauty of her. "Well, maybe I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a bit brusque. But the Long Arc is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dangerous one, and I haven't had much</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for polishing up my manners. Go</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE STRAIGHTENED, with an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly graceful, flowing motion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked over to the single chair, her slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs kicking the toga into a swirl about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her knees. "Why is it so dangerous?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "This Jason, whoever he is, has</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked out a way to pirate an overdrive</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. But surely it would be possible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give merchant vessels an escort--or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to arm them. We did both during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">war."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, it's possible. The Telemachus is</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed--you didn't know that? Well, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">is; you can't see it from Star Deck, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's a turret with two synchrons in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the ship's belly, and murder-guns--</seg><seg type="columnLine">pom-poms--all along her periphery. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the war those guns were manned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Patrol crews who knew their business.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now the Patrol's being demobbed, and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we get into trouble we'll have to put or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary merchant ratings into the turret.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our gunnery officer's a good man, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't be in the turret and on the bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time. As for a convoy--you</seg><seg type="columnLine">should know more about that than I do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN CYGNI	77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I did, I wouldn't be asking."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your father and his egg-headed young</seg><seg type="columnLine">crony Paul Haagen were the first Coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cilmen to call for eternal peace and pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perity--and the reduction of the Patrol to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fifth of its normal strength. The Patrol</seg><seg type="columnLine">has its hands full now just enforcing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spaceways Act in the System, let alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">having monitors to spare this far out."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw her delicate eyebrows arch in</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzlement, and added, "This Jason has</seg><seg type="columnLine">a demobbed G'anymedian cruiser. A screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smaller vessels wouldn't do us a bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">good; he could immobilize them by threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening to blast us the minute the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired on him. It takes a bigger vessel than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heavy to beat a heavy to the punch; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">battleplane will do, but a monitor's better."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But monitors are too big to use except</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the asteroids. Surely there must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be some to spare out here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dirk laughed. "Sure. But there's a mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">limit on overdrive. The liners are just</seg><seg type="columnLine">under that limit. Monitors are 'way over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. With a monitor escort, it'd take us</seg><seg type="columnLine">about 11.02 years to get to 61 Cygni from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Centaurus, with everybody sick from ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celeration pressure most of the time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl frowned and was silent.

Dirk asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's fashionable," she said. Abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">she came out of her study. She stood up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung to the door, and stepped out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corridor. At the last instant she looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at him and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mine," she said, "has a propelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge in it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next instant she was gone, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dirk with his jaw hanging. The smile had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been gorgeous, but that final speech cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly didn't go with it. He'd been pumped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">outthought, and shiwed where it counted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had half a mind to drag the girl back</seg><seg type="columnLine">78	^	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in again and demand an accounting--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden, choking pall of darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped over his head and shoulders, cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting the thought off. It took him nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second to accept what had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The glo-pup had gone out!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE THICK BLACKNESS, Dirk</seg><seg type="columnLine">churned his way to the locker and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dress blouse. The shiv, at least, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still in it. He zipped the heavy cloth closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with nervous fingers and jerked the blouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly into order. The shoes could sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they were--whatever had happened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silence of bare feet might be useful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was anything but silent in the corri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dor. The deck shuddered to the running</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scores of feet, and doors banged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their slots. There were shouts and frantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">scramblings and scattered screams. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">glo-pups were out in the corridor, too;</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably all over the ship. It was impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, but they Were out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blackout!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Someone thudded into Dirk's shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grabbed at him. Hands locked around</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat, heavy shoes kicked at his shins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He balled one fist over the other and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove his arms up with all his strength--•</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man hanging onto him howled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbled backwards. Grimly Dirk ploughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the struggling mob. Thirty meters</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead there was a companionway to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow--if he could reach it. He wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Nadya had managed to reach her cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">before--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Btsiiiirrrrrrrrrr !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw himself flat against the cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal of the deck. The shiv ricocheted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went racketing down the corridor, yowling</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue murder. Someone stepped on Dirk's</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand, hard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Someone was lying next to him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">dug his bare toes against the metal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to swim away from under the tramp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling feet. A small, wiry hand dug into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">biceps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lie still!" Nadya's voice hissed. "Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll put a shiv in your kidneys--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dirk didn't stop to bow from the waist;</seg><seg type="columnLine">not exactly, anyhow. He doubled himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">up suddenly, catching the girl a sickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow in the solar plexus. Then he caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suddenly-relaxed hand on his arm and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged her after him. If he could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">them both over against the wall--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somehow, he made it. His captive was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to struggle again. He took her</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the hair and dragged her ear over</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop it," he growled. The girl bucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, but the cruel blow Dirk had dealt</seg><seg type="columnLine">her had taken its toll.

Nothing like a siren</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pile madness on top of madness!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mob surged toward the levitator</seg><seg type="columnLine">shafts, every last man trying to claw up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Star Deck where there was at least an</seg><seg type="columnLine">allusion of open spaces. After several eter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nities, B-Deck was quiet, except for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless moaning somewhere astern.

There was a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, and Dirk felt a vague shame at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surge of relief that went through him</seg><seg type="columnLine">when foe saw it. Two of the crewmen were</seg><seg type="columnLine">high up in the well, heat-rifles at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready; and the beam of a dismounted land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-light poured down the shaft.

"At ease.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is First Mate Phillips."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flared muzzles did not waver. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">know who you are," one of the space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men said.

The glow of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jury-rigged ethon-tube gleamed on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bald head. The navigator's desk was emp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty; Dirk let the girl slump into the empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat and yanked the G.

"That damned Sanders--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, sir," the Third Mate's voice said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He came through the D-Deck hatch, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stapledon, the 'vision boss, at his heels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both of them looked considerably mussed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN CYGNI	79</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is this, a game?"

"A</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine bunch of officers Interstellar gives me</seg><seg type="columnLine">--too busy rescuing their favorite civilians</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remember their General Orders. I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose you wouldn't pull the gas 'til you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had this man on the bridge, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir," Sanders said, swallowing. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean, yes, sir, I did. But nothing hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened.

Sanders, get a party and</seg><seg type="columnLine">run down the trouble in the main lighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines." The Captain's blunt hands readied</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the geotron cutout. At the same in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant, Dirk hurled himself from the inte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph in a flying tackle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Muir came down with a heavy thud,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he struck fighting.

Somehow he got one foot planted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Dirk's dhest and heaved, his thigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles knotting under 'his tight uniform.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dirk felt himself flying. A second later</seg><seg type="columnLine">he smashed into the far wall and Muir</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a shiv pointed at his middle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now then, Mr. Phillips," Muir said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing heavily.

He went out, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ragged breathing merging with the surf of</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrified moaning beating up from below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ghost ship solidified: a long, tur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STOMUES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ret-knotted torpedo scarcely ten miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.

Put up that rifle, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sanders, and muster me some pom-pom</seg><seg type="columnLine">crews."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if in answer, twin bolts of greenish</seg><seg type="columnLine">light leapt from the Argo TI's dorsal tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ret. The Telemachus boomed like a cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">bass drum. The concussion knocked them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all to the deck. The alarm siren cut in</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.

In the shambles</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Star Deck, passengers looked at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other and at what they had done. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them wept.

His technies had</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty of opportunity to disconnect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas-trips at the same time they installed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sets.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the creak and jingle of his harness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rapid clopclop of the hengist's hoofs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a background of hooting night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The crumbling city walls loomed darkly</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him, rearing enormously against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the myraid brilliant, unwinking stars. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had half expected to find the gates closed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but instead a fire blazed in the tunnel which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gateway made through the walls. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen city guards stood about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They sprang to alertness as he rode up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden wall of spears leaning forth in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of him.

His skin was a sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned leathery brown where theirs was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tawny, his long slant eyes a brilliant green</seg><seg type="columnLine">where theirs were dark, and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">jeweled rings in his pointed ears. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleanshaven in accordance with southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom, but the high cheekbones, thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight nose, and long jaw were not theirs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you, stranger," demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guard captain, "and what is your er-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rand ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I am Alfric, Beodan's son, of Aslak,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he answered truthfully enough, "and am</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply wandering about in search of em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployment. Perhaps Valkarion could use</seg><seg type="columnLine">another sword-arm, or some merchant may</seg><seg type="columnLine">want a good warrior to help guard his</seg><seg type="columnLine">caravan, or--" he spread his calloused</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands in a general gesture. No need to add</seg><seg type="columnLine">that perhaps some highwayman was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">town recruiting or some would-be rebel</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in search of an experienced war-cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain who would help for the loot.

The Emperor Au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reon is dying. He is not expected to last</seg><seg type="columnLine">till dawn. The Thirty-ninth Dynasty dies</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, and--and there is no successor!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wind mumbled under the eaves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattling the window frame and flowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkly through the alley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha!" Alfric laughed harshly, exult-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antly. "A chance--by Ruho, what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of a sudden he stiffened, and the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of danger was a great shout in his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sat up, cocking his ears, and heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint scratch and scrape--aye, under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, coming close--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He slid from the covers and drew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword where it lay on the floor. The boards</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt cold under his bare feet, the night air</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingered his skin with icy hands. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">is it?" whispered Freha. She sat up, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark hair tumbling past her frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. "What is it, Alfric?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made no answer, but padded over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the window. Flattened against the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood waiting as a hand raised the sash</seg><seg type="columnLine">from outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pale cold light of Amaris fell on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand that now gripped the sill. A body</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted itself, one-handed, the other clutch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a knife. For an instant Alfric saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat hairless face in the moonlight, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">double crescent brand livid against its hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible blankness. Then in one rippling mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the slave was inside the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alfric thrust, slicing his heart. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man fell, another swarmed up behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He and Alfric faced each other, tableau</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one instant of rivering moonlight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whining wind and remotely beating gong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the barbarian's long arm shot out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yanked the slave in, and twisted him in an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">unbreakable wrestler's grip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Talk!" he hissed into the ear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhing creature. "Talk, or I'll break you</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone by bone. Why are you here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He can't," said Freha. She came up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, white in the moonlight, her long hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowing loose about her shoulders. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temple breeds these slaves, raises them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from birth to utter, fanatical obedience.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And-- see--" She pointed to the dead man</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaping under the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stooping over, Alfric saw that he had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">110	tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NORTHERNER shuddered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a convulsive movement, he broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neck of his prisoner and flung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body aside. "What do they want?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">panted. "Why are they after me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is a prophecy--but quick, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be others.

"Out the window!" He whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl to him, held her supple body</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his, kissed her hard and swift as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swoop of a hunting falkh. "Goodbye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Freha, you have been a wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion. I'll see you again--if I live."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But--you can't leave me!" she gasped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The slaves will burst through--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should they harm you? They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">after me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They will." He felt her shaking against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "They will, that's their way--oh!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door shuddered as a heavy weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">was flung against it. "That's they," snarl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed Alfric. "And the bolt won't hold very</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. I'd like to stay and fight, but--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come!" He grabbed his cloak off the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and buckled it across Freha's slim naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. "I'll go first-- then you jump."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He balanced on the window-sill, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped. Even as he fell, he wondered at</seg><seg type="columnLine">92	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the agility of the slaves who had crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the wall. It was of roughset stones, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">even so--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hit the muck and cobblestones of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alley with the silent poise of a jaccur, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned up to the window. It was just above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pit-black shadows, a square of dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness in the moon-whitened wall. "Come!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he called softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Freha's body gleamed briefly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight as she sprang. He caught her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms, set her down, and drew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword. "Let's go," he growled. Then sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly: "But where? Will the city guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">protect us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some might," she answered shakily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but most are controlled by fear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temple's curse. Best we go toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace. The Emperor's Household troops</seg><seg type="columnLine">are loyal to him and hate the priesthood</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seeks to usurp his power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can head that way," he nodded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"meanwhile lookipg for a place to hide."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took her hand and they trotted through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thick darkness toward the dim light</seg><seg type="columnLine">marking the end of the alley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Other feet padded in the gloom. Alfric</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled soundlessly and pulled himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl against a wall. He was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind in the dark, but he strained his ears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing them this way and that in search</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The others had also stopped moving.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would be waiting for him to stir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their own motionlessness could surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlast the girl's--anyway, the pursuit</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the room would be after him in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other moment, when the door gave way--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Run!" he snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE FELT a dart blow by the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had spoken, and lengthened</seg><seg type="columnLine">his frantic stride. A form rose before him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague in the night. He chopped down with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sword, and felt a grim joy at the rip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping of flesh and sundering of bone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now--out of the alley, into a street not</seg><seg type="columnLine">much wider or lighter, and down its sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dowy length. The slaves would be behind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a one-story house ahead, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the usual flat-roofed construction. "Up!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped Alfric, and made a stirrup of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. He fairly flung the girl onto the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">roof. She gave him a hand up, bracing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet against the parapet, and they fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">down together behind it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alfric heard the slaves' bare feet trot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting below him, but dared not risk a glance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snakelike, he and Freha slithered across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the housetop. Only a narrow space separat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed them from the next; they jumped that</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crossed over to another and higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof. From this, Alfric peered into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A couple of city guards were walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down it, spears at the ready. Alfric won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered whether he should join them--no,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would be no shield against a blow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun dart sent from an alley--anyway, they;</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be priest-loyal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put his mouth to Freha's ear, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">then aware of the dark silky hair tickling</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips, and whispered; "What next?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know." She looked ahead over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nighted roofs to the great central</seg><seg type="columnLine">forum, still ruddy-bright with torches. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond it, the city climbed toward a double</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill, on either crest of which was a build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. One must be the palace, thought Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fric--it was in the graceful colonnaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">style of the later Empire, white marble</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinder Amaris. Nearly all its windows were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark; but he thought, puzzledly, that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was surrounded by a ring of fires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other building was a great gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile, sprawling its grim massiveness in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">red blaze of light. From it came the steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">gong-beat and a rising chant--the Temple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Two Moons, holding vigil at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wedding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night was huge above them, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vault of infinite crystal black in which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars glittered in their frosty myriads and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Milky Way tumbled its bright mysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous cataract between the constellations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pale disc of Amaris rode high, paint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the city and the hills and the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea-floor with its cold ghostly light. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now Dannos was swinging rapidly out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the west, brightening the dark and cast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing weird double shadows that slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhed with its changing position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was bitter chill. The wind blew and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew, hooting down the streets, banging</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs and driving dead leaves and sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bits of parchment before it. Alfric</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivered, wishing for the rest of his clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VIRGIN OF VALKARION	93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In the waxing moonlight, he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand-devils whirling on the sea-bottom, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">witches' dance--and on such a night, trolls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ghosts and the Fates themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">might well be abroad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He set his teeth against chattering and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to fix his mind on real and desper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately urgent problems. "The priests seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed able to trace us," he said. "At least,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew where I went for lodging.

They jumped down to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and darted into the shadows on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Slipping along the walls of buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">they followed its twisting length for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. An occasional cloaked form passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently by; otherwise there was only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter wind echoing hollowly along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel-like streets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of a sudden Alfric stiffened. He heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the measured tramp of feet--a city patrol</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching, just around the next comer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whirling, he led the way into an alley</seg><seg type="columnLine">black as a cave mouth. It was blind, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a door at the end, from behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">which came the twanging of harps and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin evil whine of desert flutes. A tavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">--shelter, of a sort--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moonlight glistened on steel as the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen guardsmen passed the alley--passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, and turned back. "They may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," Alfric heard a voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cursing under his breath, the northerner</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the door and stepped through, into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a room barely lit by a few tapers, thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">with smoke and the smell of unwashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies. Alfric's nostrils quivered at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy sweet odor of shivash, and he no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed the floor covered with stupefied smok-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers. A little yellow man scurried back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth, filling the pipes. At the farther end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with music and girls, were wine-drinkers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ragged men of ill aspect who looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hands on knives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Freha slammed the bolt down behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and Alfric brandished his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword and said to them all; "Show us a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fist beat on the door, a voice shouted:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Open, in the name of the Holy Temple!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No way out," gasped the landlord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is always an exit to these dens,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped Freha. "Show us, or we split your</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man's knife-hand moved with blur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring speed. Alfric stopped the thrown dag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger with his sword-blade in a clang of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel, caught it in midair, and hurled it</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. The man screamed as it thunked into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his belly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Out!" snarled the barbarian, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glaive sang about the landlord's ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here," cried the little man, running</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the end of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door groaned as the guardsmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled themselves against it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The landlord opened a concealed trap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Only darkness was visible below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alfric snatched a torch from the wall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a tunnel of dark stone. "Down!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapped, and Freha jumped. He followed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolting the trap behind him. It was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy iron--the soldiers would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work to break through it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tunnel stretched hollowly away on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side. Freha broke into a run and Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fric loped beside her, the torch streaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one hand and the sword agleam in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Their footfalls echoed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold moist dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is this?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Old sewers--not used now when water</seg><seg type="columnLine">is scarce--a warren under the city--''gasp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed Freha.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can hide here, then," he panted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--only the Temple knows all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passages--they'll have slaves guarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">every exit--we'll be trapped unless we get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out soon--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dim sky showed ahead, a hole with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rusted iron ladder leading up into it.

Here there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as least an absence of people to interfere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE SPRANG OUT and rushed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three, so swiftly that they were hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of him before his blade was shriek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about them. One man tumbled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head nearly sheared off. Another yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">led, leaping back to thrust with his spear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alfric dodged the jab, grabbed the shaft in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand and pulled. The guardsman</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled forward and Alfric's sword rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his helmet. He dropped, stunned by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fury of the blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The third was on Alfric like an angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaccur. His spear-thrust furrowed along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barbarian's ribs. Alfric closed in, grin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning savagely in the cold white moonlight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thrust with his sword. The guard par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried the blow with his small buckler, drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped his spear, arid drew his shortsword.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bending low, he rushed in, probing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alfric's guts, and the northerner skipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside barely in time. The broadsword</seg><seg type="columnLine">chopped down, through the guard's left</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg.

Alfric knocked the sword from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerveless hand and brought his own blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the guardsman's throat. "Hold,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "One word, one movement, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll roll in the gutter with your com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rades."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Freha came up, the cloak blowing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her wondeful naked body in the wild wind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was a fay sight under the moons, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoner groaned as he saw her.

Spears</seg><seg type="columnLine">pricked their backs, the chains rattled on</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankles and wrists.

They were caught, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were done; all his struggles were the vain</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhings of a beast in a cage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So this ends it." Hildaborg's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was weary. Then she smiled a little. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we made a good try, Alfric."

The gong-beat was a steady, tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous crashing--it seemed to fill the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world with its brazen clamor. High rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chant of the Moon Wedding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warrior glanced aside, over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace. There was a bridge spanning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gully between the two hillcrests, and guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on it. Other guards, city and Temple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were besieging the palace; he saw their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires in a ring about it. They were setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a great ballista whose stones, he knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bring the walls down in ruin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the hilltop he could see over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon-whitened desert and the vast reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old sea-bottom. Once it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue and alive, glittering with sunlight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long waves rolling in to crash in foam</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thunder on a dazzling beach. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">harbor of Valkarion had been crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ships from all the world, a forest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall masts, a wild perfumery of salt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tar and the spices of the south. And be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond, the land had been green, and white</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds had sailed through a soft blue sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WELL, IT WAS GONE--the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dried into desert and scrubby</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest and harsh meadowland, sand blew</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ancient beds of rivers and seas, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air was thin and chill and held a bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">tang of rust. The cities were in ruins, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VIRGIN OF</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Empire was a shadow, and man was gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to a few wretched remnants, sinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">into barbarism and death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alfric looked up to the cold, splendid</seg><seg type="columnLine">night sky. There was a tradition from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise ancients, he had once been told, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">those swarming bright star-hosts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">other worlds and suns, happier, maybe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">than this. It was some consolation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Moons were near their mating now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bright Dannos was sweeping triumphantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on pale Mother Amaris; he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover her and then pass on, and out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that wedding would come the fate of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. Cold fate, dark destiny--night and</seg><seg type="columnLine">famine and death, the moons hurtling over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a world sunk into final oblivion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, men died, sometime or other, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all they could do about it was to meet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end bravely.

Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, Alfric's eyes gleamed greenly. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">loot that room!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They turned off along another hall, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then down a stone-cut flight of steps into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Temple dungeons. Alfric had been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough jails before not to find the damp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough-hewn rock tunnels strange, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hildaborg shuddered and pressed closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A scream echoed down the corridor, rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell and died raggedly into the echoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The priest smirked.

So he fell into silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the door opened again. A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in with only two torch-bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temple slaves accompaning. Alfric look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed at his magnificent robes and knew him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Therokos the High Priest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE WAS TALL, stoop-shouldered, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little on Che fat side but well mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cled underneath. His face was wide and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy, sallow under the high shaven fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, the mouth hard and thin, the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">small and black and glittering-cold. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke, his voice was wondrous, a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">organ which he played like a master musi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So we meet again, your majesty," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and bowed. There was little mockery</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his tones; he seemed straightforward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and businesslike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hildaborg did not answer. She stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her beautous form in its ragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier's tunic pressed against the wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her sweat-dampened black hair clung to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her forehead, fell down her shoulders in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining wave.

"And so you are the conqueror</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the prophecy," he murmured. "A mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--but just how did you think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do it? Who are your allies in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city? What was your plan?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am Alfric of Aslak, and I came here</seg><seg type="columnLine">without friends or plan, knowing nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any prophecy," answered the barbarian</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">coldly. "And you are a misbegotten son of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a she-garm, with whose head I will yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">play football."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come now," said Therokos softly, sure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly you do not expect me to believe you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are here by mere chance? Your cause is</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost, you are doomed, but you can save</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself the inquisition and die easily if</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you will tell us what you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know nothing, you jerrad!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may know more after the inquisi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioners have worked on you awhile," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therokos coldly. Then turning to Hilda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">borg, his voice suddenly rich and warm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbing with love and pity: "My lady,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my lady, you do not know how I regret</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. That the Empress of Valkarion</seg><seg type="columnLine">should, even for dire necessity, be thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">humiliated in the greatest sorrow of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hildaborg's lip curled. "I see you weep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing," she said coldly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I do, my lady--my heart is ashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">within me. Only need drove me to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and it is not yet too late to repent, your</seg><seg type="columnLine">majesty. What the Moons have taken, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moons can restore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely, my lady," said Therokos rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonably, "you can see the absolute necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my actions. Under the law, you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not rule, and there was no Imperial heir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without a strong hand, leaderless Val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">karion would have split under the quarrel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the nobles and the lawlessness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">commons, easy prey for barbarian enemies</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as this man--and the Sibyl's warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have come true. With the Imperium</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, the Temple, sole remaining pillar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Valkarion, must bear the burden o£j</seg><seg type="columnLine">state."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In other words," said Hildaborg coldly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you will have yourself annointed Theo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Moons have seen fit thus to honor</seg><seg type="columnLine">my unworthiness," said Therokos. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would still be well if we should unite</seg><seg type="columnLine">our forces. You have many loyal friends,!</seg><seg type="columnLine">my lady, myself not the least of them. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will but wed me, we can together unite</seg><seg type="columnLine">the factions in the city and build the Em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pire anew."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled, almost a sneer. "Yours was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange courtship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have told you how the necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VIRGIN OF VALKARION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grieved me," said the priest. Suddenly his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice came hard as steel, cold as winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and death: "It is now my duty to offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">you a choice. Call on your troops to sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">render, your followers in the city to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sist from their treasonous activities, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wed me this night, or--" he paused--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"burn at the stake for blasphemy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">witchcraft. But first you will be tied down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and every slave in the Temple have his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That might not be worse than leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">my men into your hands," she flared. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face was suddenly bloodless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will be surprised how much worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will be--especially since your men will</seg><seg type="columnLine">die anyway. But I will offer you this, too:</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you call on them to surrender, those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who do may go into exile."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stood a moment in silence, and Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fric knew what a horror must be clawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">her heart. Then she nodded toward him:</seg><seg type="columnLine">/'What of my protector here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The heathen bandit must die in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, that the city may know itself safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him and the prophecy," said Thero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kos. "He still has his choice of easy hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing or slow torture. But if yqu refuse me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hildaborg, he will no longer have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice; he wrll go to hell by inches, cursing</seg><seg type="columnLine">you for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lovely dark head bowed. It was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if a flame had gone out. Alfric felt ill</seg><seg type="columnLine">at seeing her thus broken, given over to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifetime's prisoning--golden chains they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be, but no less heavy and galling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Goodbye, my dear," he whispered. "Good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bye, I will always love you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She made no reply, but said to Thero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kos, tonelessly: "I yield me, lord."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The high priest's face lit,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and Alfric realized dully that The-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rokos, too, loved the queen--in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold way.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty corridor echoed dully to their foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls.

"Best you give</seg><seg type="columnLine">up peaceably, saving trouble and lives on</seg><seg type="columnLine">both sides.

The March Planet was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in comparison with both previous issues of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine and with current competition, outstand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I was at first undecided whether to buy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue or nay, for lately I have found much better</seg><seg type="columnLine">things to read and don't want to spend my time</seg><seg type="columnLine">consuming the kind of trash that is currently</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooding the science-fiction field. I apologize ior</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentally placing you in that category. The line-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up would have sold even the most hardened fan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indeed, the contents page was thrilling reading.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You have reached a new level--now stay up there;</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you hear?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only story I did not enjoy was ASTERIOD</seg><seg type="columnLine">OF FEAR, which I skipped after the first five</seg><seg type="columnLine">pages. Leigh Brackett is Leigh Brackett, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is heartily satisfying. Her story _ was a relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Coppel's puny efforts to imitate her. Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vogt was good, also Anderson and Fyfe. Reprints</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not a bad idea, but if you start to run out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">good material, please have the good sense to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give it up.

We find at once that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Strong is an infinitely superior creature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">high above the standard norm. One might say he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a clear cleared! This has not affected Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strong in any way, however. He himself seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">to want to tell us; he is a snob. We find that Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strong has a great knowledge and appreciation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of great literature. He is the one man in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">who understands Ray Bradbury. One begins to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder why he reads Planet when he could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">having the time of his life persuing something</seg><seg type="columnLine">educational, such as "The Decameron." We find,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, a hidden meaning in his denunciation of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor psychopathetical pseudo-intellects. We find</seg><seg type="columnLine">here a highly egotistical snob whose own ego is</seg><seg type="columnLine">either so steeped in a superiority complex, or so</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingulfed in an inferiority complex, that he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">denounce the attempts of science-fiction fans and</seg><seg type="columnLine">readers (a group of which every member is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sub-moron but himself) to be' funny, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">must end his letter with a disgustingly unwitty</seg><seg type="columnLine">paragraph concerning the spelling of a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">name! Perhaps by itself, Mr. Strong's effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">might seem mildly amusing, but climaxing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flood of insult and abuse which he has written</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is nauseously out of place and degrading.
