We read of calms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a month in duration, when a corked</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty bottle, thrown over the side one</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, would be still there twenty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours afterwards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The American, Commander Matthew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fontaine Maury, carried out exhaustive</seg><seg type="columnLine">researches on ocean winds and currents,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his work, of such value but a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago, is losing its importance as</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sails are supplanted by coal and oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel in boilers and by combustion en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An exactly parallel problem or series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of problems has been studied out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air pilot and air navigator. A strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">head wind may cut his speed down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">half what it should be. It is not pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to utilize the knowledge of air for</seg><seg type="columnLine">application to airplane courses, as has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been done for the winds and currents</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ocean for sailing ships, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">like steamers and motor ships, the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane has to take a definite course and</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow it pretty closely. The sailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship of old days, with its ability to sail</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly within forty-five or fifty degrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an adverse wind, could often welcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">a head wind as being better than none.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the airplane, like the steamer, fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing its course and watching for land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fields does no tacking, but goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">right ahead. It is subject to all sorts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes in the wind, especially if it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">flown low. At a sufficient height these</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes in some measure disappear, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that an almost comparatively even atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere may prevail. Professor Piccard</seg><seg type="columnLine">who has studied the subject and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascensions of ten miles or more, claims</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the stratosphere, at ten miles or</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater elevation, is the place for air</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel of the future. Comparatively little</seg><seg type="columnLine">change in air currents are present there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if rocket propulsion is developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the relative efficiency, owing to the rare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction of the air would be high. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">propulsion by propeller might not be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">good as nearer the surface. It is also</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat of a problem how the wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">would operate in such low pressure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">support the airplane. The air at ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles elevation can be used by a plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it is uncertain as to its economy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It almost seems as if it were time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">develop a new type of flying machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">to operate in a partial vacuum, in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere of very low pressure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The physiological aspect of the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">is yet to be satisfactorily studied. Beebe</seg><seg type="columnLine">has gone down into the ocean in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathysphere. He needed no clumsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">divers' suit, heavy helmet and leaden</seg><seg type="columnLine">soled shoes. For stratosphere flying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, hermetically sealed, with oxygen</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply and air purifying and air condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioning, should take the place of the cum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brous helmet and personal equipment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high-altitude flyer. The passengers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if there were such, should be taken care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of by the sealed cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A very curious point is brought out</seg><seg type="columnLine">by comparing the range of man's travel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertical with horizontal. An ocean trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the world, twenty or thirty thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand miles, is now an ordinary thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miles mean little on land or sea in hori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zontal travelling. But when man at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempts vertical travel it is different. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is fair to call three hundred feet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme limit for a diver in his suit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is really more than is practical.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even three hundred feet, the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance a runner can traverse in ten sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds, is a trivial affair in feet and inches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To attain a hitherto "unfathomable"</seg><seg type="columnLine">layer of ocean the Beebe bathysphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">already alluded to, was constructed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a depth of about 3000 feet was tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umphantly atained. This seems an</seg><seg type="columnLine">insignificant distance, but the pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the water gives a condition, far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a similar characterization. The pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Beebe bathysphere if we multiply</seg><seg type="columnLine">its superficial area in inches by 1200 or</seg><seg type="columnLine">1500 lbs., gives the range of pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal has to resist. Man could go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an indefinite depth in the ocean were</seg><seg type="columnLine">it not for the high pressure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is a mountain in the Himalayas</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fraction over five and a half miles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">height. We can call this little more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour's walk on the level for a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">grade pedestrian. But we have seen that</seg><seg type="columnLine">man is a very poor vertical traveller With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the assistance of porters to carry his out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">SPACE TRAVELING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fit, making one camp after another on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain and using oxygen for breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, he has never yet reached the top by</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing, and several lives have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrificed in attempts to achieve this</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless, tour de force, in English, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunt, for that is all that it amounts to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an airplane or a balloon pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided with special appliances to protect</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from the low pressure and temper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ature changes man can ascend to over</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice this height.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Man can only slightly change his al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titude; his range is ten or eleven miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The best he has ever done is sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to be about eleven miles. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">heights reached by balloon or airplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">are determined by the registration of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">barograph, which registers air pressure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whose readings of air pressure are</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken as convertible into miles and frac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of height. This is the best that</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be done, for triangulation of objects</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that height cannot be carried out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of the earth. It would seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite possible to triangulate from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car of a balloon to base marks on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the earth and this would at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least be an approximation to a definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">result. The inaccuracy of the barograph</seg><seg type="columnLine">is due principally to the fact that air</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure is subject to local variations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An approximate method of correction</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this source of error is to take re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated readings of the air pressure on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, during the ascent; one bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ometer-reading every hour would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty good practise. But then the trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble is that the variations in atmospheric</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure at the surface of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">might and probably would be different</seg><seg type="columnLine">from those existing at an elevation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The endeavor to attain great eleva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions has had its tragedies in mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing, where ten thousand or fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet is a fair distance to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed. Mount Everest has had a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of deaths to its credit, or more prop-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">erly to its discredit, but it has never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been climbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ascending into the stratosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a partially inflated balloon has had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very high percentage of victims, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though so few have attempted it. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">old time theory of ballooning was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balloon if it lost its gas would act</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a parachute, but this has not held</seg><seg type="columnLine">good in stratosphere ascensions.

He walked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the sled with Nita and picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">several black boxes containing delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific instruments. He removed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">micro-camera and set it up, close to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bodies in the cabin, and then fo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cused the sensitive lens upon the severed</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh.

With these two</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments used in conjunction War-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ren hoped to establish beyond dispute</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that the weapon used was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame-knife, a devilish device which only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few high-born Plutonians were per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted to own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warren and Ross were weary by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time they completed the work of record-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the evidence and they left the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">to return to the sled for a night's sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the morning they intended to begin</seg><seg type="columnLine">excavating the frozen ground in search</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Gordon Bancroft's laboratory which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they estimated to be not more than two</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from where they were. Outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was pitch dark. The heavy outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket of chilled atmosphere did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">permit the moonlight or starlight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrate to the surface of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR some unknown reason Nita had</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched off the rhomium illumina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors.

She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired, he thought, and needed all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest she could get. His portable il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminator flickered feebly and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">died down to a faint red glow. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady use of it had exhausted the rhom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ium charge and he had not brought a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spare tube along.

It came from the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of their sled. For just one mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment Warren and Ross thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nita or Palmer had turned on the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful rhomiums. But never be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore had they beheld anything so inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive.

He could not mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it. It was the voice of Gurra! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his light they had seen in the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance when they had approached the site</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he and his men had evidently been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding in ambush until they thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe to attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above the din Warren heard Nita</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming his name. The two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were confused by the suddenness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, but they rushed forward savagely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be met by the hot, searing flame.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They dropped to the ground w'ith a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangled cry, but the flame followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them relentlessly and burned the hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and skin on their scalps. By now they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were half frantic with rage and pain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They ran desperately to escape the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding light and the hot flame, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it followed them pitilessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vague, disjointed thoughts flashed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Warren's mind. Gurra would play</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them, torture them in the sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nita, and when he tired of his devilish</seg><seg type="columnLine">game he would merely focus the flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a knife edge and sever their heads</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from their bodies. And Nita . . . ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">What would become of her?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN their frenzy the two men raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">A madly in ever-widening circles. Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right they collided violently. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies sprawled on the ground and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of the impetus rolled them over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over again down a steep incline.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although almost senseless wTith pain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warren realized that he was being pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled towards the edge of the crevasse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he did nothing to stop himself. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be far better to be dashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces at the bottom of a mile-deep cre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vasse than to be roasted ignominiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the evil Gurra.

For this very reason the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dwellers of the Caves had found it im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to venture to the regions above.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were two possible solutions to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this problem: one was to equip their</seg><seg type="columnLine">men with masks, a plan abandoned al~</seg><seg type="columnLine">most before it was conceived, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacked the material from which to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struct them, and the other was to per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form the work of excavating without</seg><seg type="columnLine">any outside help, a seemingly impossible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">task, For a long time they were per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexed, but suddenly Ross Griffin</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapped his startled friend on the back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so heartily that Warren winced with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the easiest thing in the world!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You and I can do it alone.

Yesterday, while you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking a nap, they took me down below</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a deep underground cave, where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw their chemists compounding it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">minerals they mine in this location.

Now, the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States, abetted by her acquisitions, cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly had the most powerful means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">oceanic offense and defense in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.

Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ica, fearing treachery, refused her pleas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and further incurred the resentment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Orientals by commanding curtail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of airplane production, and the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duction of the existing fleet. Japan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after entering a formal protest against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the severity of the terms, said nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, and apparently once again peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">reigned supreme over the entire globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Recently there had been reports from</seg><seg type="columnLine">various secret agents in the East that</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble was brewing among the oriental</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations, but nothing indicative of open</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostility had occurred.

It was evident that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">road could have been built along its</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipitous sides, without it being vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible plainly at a distance, and no such</seg><seg type="columnLine">mar defaced the cinder-covered lava of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steep slope.

If it didn't wind its way</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the mountain, where did it go?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The solution was soon disclosed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nearing the base of the hill, Tsi-Lo</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned left along the smooth crest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an interrupted lava flow, and followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the base of the mountain for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards. The road now turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly to the right, and led to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark yawning mouth of a tunnel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Switching on the headlights, Tsi-Lo</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove swiftly into the black opening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The car roared its challenge to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep climb, and the walls of the cave</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoed and reechoed, until it seemed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain must split apart from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">commotion in its 'innards/ Almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">deafened, the four friends made no at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt at conversation, and spent their</seg><seg type="columnLine">time examining the passage through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they were speeding. Illumined as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was by the brilliant lights of the car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could plainly see that it was man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. Its walls and top were rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jagged, and once they caught a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of dynamite boxes piled in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short cross cut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Some distance ahead, a point of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">became visible, growing quickly as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped along. Soon they emerged through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening, and were almost blinded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the sudden glare of the sun. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eyes had become accustomed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, they eagerly examined their sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They found they had penetrated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior of the crater, and as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobile now came to rest, they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were on a circular balcony of</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid lava, some two hundred feet wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which extended entirely around the cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumference of the crater. In the mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle of the crater yawned a huge hole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">around which the balcony seemed mirac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulously suspended. Several hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings of various sizes were scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the huge ledge. Men were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and going busily, while from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths of the huge center pit came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds of many voices and the clanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bustle of intense activity. Huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">flood-lights illumined the pit for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit of the workmen, and made vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible the intricate machinery it con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained. Sounding even above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamor and noise of the workmen, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a deep roaring which seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from the depths of the pit below</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. At one side arose a pipe, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which a mighty volume of steam rose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air above them to condense and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall like mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their observations were cut short as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tsi-Lo motioned them from the car.

Beside the desk, a well dressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oriental, presumably Japanese, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy with a pile of papers. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at their entrance, arose and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sweeping bow, and said in perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UJ ADIES and gentlemen.

There,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broad stairway led down to the depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. They followed him down some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet to the superficial bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pit, on which rested the maze of</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery they had glimpsed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">above. This, however, was not yet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom. He led the way down another</seg><seg type="columnLine">stair into a huge, underground chamber,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which seemed to issue the tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous roaring they had heard above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The odor of ozone was strong in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, and the roar almost deafened them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Looming up in the vague light of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room were numbers of huge masses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery from which issued the deep</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hum. Shouting to make himself heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the din, Mercadon explained:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Our workmen, using a churn drill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrated three thousand feet into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowrels of the volcano, and tapped an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous steam-pressure area. Installed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this chamber are ten of the largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamos in the world. These gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ators are run by huge steam turbines and</seg><seg type="columnLine">generate over fifteen million horsepower</seg><seg type="columnLine">apiece, or a total of over one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fifty million."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TURNING, Mercadon led the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">back up the stairs to the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the initial pit. The pit was probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred feet across, and occupying</seg><seg type="columnLine">its very center was the intricate mass the</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends had seen from the balcony. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to consist of an enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchlight with its reflector about</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet in diameter, and which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted on a vertical shaft one foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. Sturdy framework held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft rigidly in numerous bearings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base of the shaft was apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">geared to a motor on the floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit. A two foot swivel conduit led</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the generator room below the pit</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the huge light above. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">set-up gave the impression that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light was constructed to revolve at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a circle around the searchlight, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distance of about one hundred feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was what appeared at first sight, to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enormous picket fence. Closer ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servation showed that the "stakes" were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in reality round shafts of some silvery</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, translucent substance. The shafts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were about two inches in diameter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended from the bottom of the pit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rim of the balcony--a distance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred feet. They were placed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fraction of an inch apart--about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickness of a case knife blade. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete circle was connected both at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top and at the base of the pillars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with heavy insulated cable, and the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire "fence" was mounted on heavy in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see here," said Mercadon, "A--■"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was interrupted by the clanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a gong. Turning hurriedly, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">beckoned the four to follow him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his way up the stairs to the bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cony above. The workmen had ev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idently completed their jobs, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared from the pit. Men were as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembling from all directions to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of a building which was set well</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the edge of the balcony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The friends followed the Jap as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried toward the assembled group. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">a staging at the edge of the pit was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch board with numerous dials and</seg><seg type="columnLine">several ebony handled switches. Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cadon stopped before the board and</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, "The time has come?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, your honor, it is now one min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute till four o'clock."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mercadon turned to watch the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond hand of a clock incorporated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the board. As the hand moved around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dial, he laid his hand on the handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one of the switches. As it reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the figure 60 he engaged the switch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE came the low whir of a start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor and the huge searchlight be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to revolve slowly on its vertical axis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As it gained speed, Mercadon intently</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched its dials. A moment passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he threw in a second switch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disengaged the first. The low whine of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motor grew to a screech as the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolved faster and faster, till it almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed a stationary globe in the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pit. Finally when the motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached its maximum, and the scream</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed up beyond the range of hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man ears, Mercadon again glanced at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dial--then threw a third switch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The four friends stared in amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. At the throw of the switch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently the current of the huge dy-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">namos below had been thrown into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge searchlight. The light was revolv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at far too great a speed for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam to be visible, but the entire pit</seg><seg type="columnLine">was illuminated with an eerie violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow. The circle of strange metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods surrounding the reflector gave off</seg><seg type="columnLine">iridescent, many-hued lights, changing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scintillating with a weird, cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty. Forming around the circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence, was a solid wall of coruscating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stratified radiance, which shimmered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickered like the clear, cold glow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aurora Borealis. It was a magnificent</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene, yet it gave the impression of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous, inexorably ruthless power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about which there was nothing calm or</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothing. Rather it pitched every fiber</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the body to the breaking point. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve groaned in protest against impreg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation with the racking, vibrating waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unfathomable power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mercadon turned again to the switch</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, made a few notations on a pad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled in satisfaction, and nodded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come now, let us find comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs, where I can explain all this to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you in detail--that is, if you care to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course the friends did, so Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cadon led the way back to his office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When they were all comfortable in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">places, the Jap began:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps it is best to begin at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning. During the War of 1936</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japan had one of her scientists work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the possibility of developing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">death ray.

One day while working in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory, I happened to direct my con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated beam on a small piece of ore</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had been analyzing.

Interested, I put a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowl of water in the center of the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the beam on the ore, clamped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projector in place, and examined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.

I found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained nickel, silver, iron, traces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">iridium and of gadolinium. I then con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued with my work by building up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">synthetic alloy of these five elements,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I called hyolite. I found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the high frequency beam acted</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon this alloy, the same conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">were produced---that is, the water in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">near vicinity exhibited the same peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomenon. After synthesizing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfecting the alloy, I turned my efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward determining how the action of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beam on the alloy produced those</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomena. I won't bore you with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiresome details of my research--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventually I came to the conclusion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high frequency current of my con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated beam, striking on the alloy,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was in some way changed and diversified</seg><seg type="columnLine">to produce an energy with which we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">little familiar. This energy supposedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">produces in an enormously high degree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that attraction which we call 'surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">tension,* Surface tension, as you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that attraction between the molecules</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a liquid which seems to hold them</seg><seg type="columnLine">more firmly together at the surface than</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the interior. This tension causes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contraction of a falling liquid into round</seg><seg type="columnLine">globules; it makes possible the suspen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of a steel needle on the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a calm body of water; it causes mercury</seg><seg type="columnLine">to assume the shape of the tiny spher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oids, when spread on a flat surface; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">enables the tiny insect "skipper" to glide</seg><seg type="columnLine">serenely over the surface of his pond</seg><seg type="columnLine">without wetting his feet. We see it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soap bubble. The dispersion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high frequency beam by hyolite in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creases the attraction between the mole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cules at the surface of the water--hence</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing the surface tension, and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duces a tensile strength on the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">which will support many pounds per</seg><seg type="columnLine">square inch. This enormous increase of</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface tension is, of course, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused the drying up of the faucet, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">changing the water, in effect, to a semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">«r TAVING completed my prelim-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   *	inary research, I announced my</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery to the Japanese Government.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None of them at first realized the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance of my research for that mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, neither did I at the moment.

However, the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come was foregone; the crew of the yacht</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shelter from the fire, but the Japs</seg><seg type="columnLine">had none.

Then you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that when one wave meets or</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtakes another, it may either double</seg><seg type="columnLine">or completely nullify the effect, accord-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to whether the crests and troughs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two waves coincide, or whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trough of one meets the crest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other. In the first case, the inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sity is doubled, in the second it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely destroyed. For instance, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud sounds, if so pitched and directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the crest of one wave meets the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trough of the oncoming wave, will be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come a complete silence. Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound waves are longitudinal, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same instance is applicable to both long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itudinal and transverse waves.

They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning now, I think." He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and looked at the long row of</seg><seg type="columnLine">electroscopes. Fifty men, seated before</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty sets of apparatus, were watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty different scenes. These fifty were</seg><seg type="columnLine">all equipped with small projectors, cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able of throwing voice, and, if neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary, a small scene. Quietly, low voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">were speaking into the projector trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitters. "All of the Freedom Mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers will begin at once to carry out</seg><seg type="columnLine">their parts under the General Plan--•**</seg><seg type="columnLine">Name after name was ^ead out. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the city the leaders were sending</seg><seg type="columnLine">out their signals. The search of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city was barely well under way, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been called off by any means. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now--it ended abruptly. From eighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand apartments two hundred thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand people began to mill outward. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, the Polshin guards were sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by masses of men, moving with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a deceptive air of slow determina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, that the Polshins, who had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen a planned, directed resistance, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not comprehend. Then they tried to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">use the tactics that had always served</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the few half-hysterical attacks they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had witnessed.

Crackling discharges</seg><seg type="columnLine">of electricity sprang from the shock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods--and rolled harmlessly off of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue suits of the Plehbs. The Free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom Scientists had fulfilled their prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ise.

Eight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cities of the Union were still under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rule of Polshins, Polshins patrolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in squads, with light ion guns under</seg><seg type="columnLine">their arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Bosn, Shkago, Felfya, all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities which had been in the Union {or</seg><seg type="columnLine">any length of time, and possessed any</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of proton-guns had revolted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The proton-guns were trained on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface tubes by Plehbs, where they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not ready to drive out the Polshins un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aided, and ion guns covered the tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in cities where the Plehbs had the bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of power. In some places, both</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces protected the tubes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'yak was ready for the next step.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Overhead, the telectroscope showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic cruisers roaming ceaselessly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching for any sign of attack.

Their mighty ion-guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming destruction, the stone of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock crackled in terrific heat, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground seemed to burst into flame. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "Freedom" rode calmly nearer, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion-flame splitting widely and washing</seg><seg type="columnLine">off of her magnetic shield.

One, two, finally four</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fighting ships of the N'yak Union</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appeared. A dozen great atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers clustered and now their heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio-frequency beams began to bore in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE PLANETS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Effortlessly, the slumberous giant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">material energy smashed the ten million</seg><seg type="columnLine">horsepower beams of the atomic cruisers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to flaming static discharges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bruce moved.

Five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet through the air the first discharge</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed its way, the two billion volt</seg><seg type="columnLine">protons crushing the molecules of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air to hydrogen and sweeping them</seg><seg type="columnLine">along. The electron discharge smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, then swiftly the alternations built</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. Like a slow-licking solar promin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence the unbelievable flame reached out</seg><seg type="columnLine">--so slow seeming, yet so swift, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleeing atomic cruiser vanished suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with but a slight alteration in the awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not so much as dust to fall back</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it died. And now the flame licked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out again, stretched, and another cruiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed into pure, blazing hydrogen gas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Mother Earth sent up a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue of her own lightning in protest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tongue of power, feeble and unreal in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frightful glare of the released giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">of matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The atomic cruisers were fleeing to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the N'yak fortress now.

A ship, loaded with ultra-pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erful explosive had driven at her in sui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cidal death. But the explosive had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached her, only flying fragments of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE N'Yak fortress was the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful in the world. Out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">range of its ion guns, Bruce was watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thoughtfully. Heavy rifles, hurling</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic explosives were firing angrily at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. A solid sheet of rippling flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared around him, and despite its auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic balances, the "Freedom" wavered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their concussions. Bruce needed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">telectroscope to see inside that metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">walled fortress. Here was a steel-barred</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell, a white bed, and a mass of dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavy hair, and a face with closed eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and warm, half-smiling lips. Smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">still in sleep over the joke played on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Omallin, the joke in which she was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pawn. Behind those metal walls--.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Bruce could see also the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired slim doctor with a blank look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupidity on his face, and a deep, human</seg><seg type="columnLine">twinkle in his dark eyes. Also behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">those metal walls, Manning deserved</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bruce's deepest consideration. But more</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, by the side of Manning, Bruce</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to see dozens, scores of Polshin</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures, stalwart men--men for all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were Polshins. Bruce had preached</seg><seg type="columnLine">a doctrine and believed it. Despite what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened, he could still believe it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of the Polshins in there were as</seg><seg type="columnLine">truly victims of the system as was he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and any Plehb. Victims of a system</seg><seg type="columnLine">that taught, them utter inconsideration</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Plehbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that fort was not like the atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers. The fort was practically un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">limited in its power, even though de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendent on atomic rather than material</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">energy. The fort could draw tremen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dous volumes of the cold, clear water</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the broad river flowing near by,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">volumes great enough to carry away even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the millions of horse power that would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be lost through the inefficiency of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">atomic engines. Then--there was no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reason why that fort should not de--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">velop two billion or two hundred billion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">horse power, at least for a short period.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">True, they used metalic conductors, un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aided by the space-columns of the "Free-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dom" ships--but they used the ten-foot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">metal wall as a conductor for one polar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ity as Bruce knew. The other was led</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through silver pillars ten feet thick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bruce felt sure he could have reduced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it with a few hours struggle. Eventu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ally, even those mighty metal conduc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tors would have given way, for when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">atoms fight against energy conducted by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">space, the warp and woof of the uni-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">verse, the outcome is foredoomed. His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">four cruisers could have arranged them-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">selves broadside to the fort, allowing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' both stern and bow proton-tubes to come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into action. Each ship turning the full</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">power of those frightful ultra-atomic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beams, driven by forces that made and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">broke suns, eight colossal tongues of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">energy, then the magnetic deflectors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the fort would have been loaded to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the uttermost. And Bruce had still an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">untried weapon--the magnetic field with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">these raised also to their maximum,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">draining and weakening the field of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fort--.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bruce frowned. Earth would tremble</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to her core under the opposing stresses</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of those titanic engines. Her metal heart</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would strain upward and twist convul-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sively. N'yak, Felfya, Bosn, even Piz-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bur and Shkaga would be endangered by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the upheavals resulting.

And--when</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally the magnetic and electric defenses</seg><seg type="columnLine">ot the fort tell, ttiey would inevitably</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall abruptly, like an electric light bulb</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the fuse blows out. And as quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, the hundreds of billions of horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, struggling to break down those</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible walls of force, would wash in</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and through. Beneath them, the ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot walls of practically infusible metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">would vanish as a single magnificent</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue of burning hydrogen gas. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls--and Lora. Lora, and every</seg><seg type="columnLine">human thing within it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SLOWLY Bruce looked at the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly waiting for his word. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out speaking, he timed in the stage at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Freedom Hall. Philips, Powr, a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred others were looking at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can break open the fort in either</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousandth part of a billionth of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second--or within six hours.

A tractor beam designed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old days to pull down a full-fledged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic battleship reached out, and tugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one of the Freedom ships till the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks of N'yak ground protestingly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other.

TYrcy Wd 'won- a.w£ rvot won.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was stalemate now. What solution</seg><seg type="columnLine">could they reach? The plan Lora had</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned ? Somehow that did not cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conditions.

Half the Polshins in the N'yak</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortress were nearly ready to believe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plehbs could do as they claimed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest were utterly unconvinced. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be no yielding on their part.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plehbs were animals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A large Polshin audience had dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in from time to time to witness Omal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin's--resistance. Manning had risked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life for the Plehbs, and one hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and three Plehbs slept now under</seg><seg type="columnLine">deltamorphium for the full three days</seg><seg type="columnLine">it allowed. But Manning was in a ceil</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, awaiting action on Omallin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">part.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A second victim was the object of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Omallin's resistance now: he was adher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing faithfully to his program. His first</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim had died for twelve and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hurriedly Bruce turned to the Labor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atory reports. He thought of Lora, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the one assistant he needed most now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but of Lora, faintly stirring to wakeful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness now, as the drug in her veins was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually absorbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The laboratory reports were good--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but somehow something seemed lacking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rapidly his mind ran over every pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible item that could help. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearer, refreshed mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, in the way of man's mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it functioned. A dog learns a trick</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, by elimination of those moves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which produce no results. A man does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not do the thing at all--or suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows the whole secret, and the direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to its accomplishment. Bruce saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a sudden shout that stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">work over all the Laboratory he sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet. ''Buck--Hal--Will--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brady. Come here." In syllables so</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift his hearers could scarcely follow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told them what he wanted. Instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned to his task. The problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had baffled them seemed solved!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In two hours, the first of the apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to arrive, the new devices. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly Bruce and his assistants began</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting it up, attaching it to the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">telectroscope in Freedom Hall. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hours, half the work was done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in four, it was completed. New appara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tus, untried in connection, was ready.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The transfer of ALL the electron waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be attempted! The transfer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">not merely one ten-thousandth part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole--but All of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't want to try it on a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">--even yet--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, you do, Bruce. There is one</seg><seg type="columnLine">human--" interrupted Powers. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">we may hope by this time--that it fails</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her case."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SLOWLY Bruce's color drained from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cheeks. With a steady hand he</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjusted the great machine, focussed it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned it on. A room appeared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the N'yak fortress. A bare metal room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a half-dozen scarlet figures. Five</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them were Polshins, scarlet because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their clothing. The sixth--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bruce worked with all the rapidity</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could muster. One of the Polshins</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wrapping electric resistance wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the sixth figure, a bound, softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">moaning figure. Cautiously Bruce ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced a control, and a light, hazy out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line surrounded the sixth figure on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Freedom Hall stage. Under Bruce's</seg><seg type="columnLine">manipulation the haze condensed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE PLANETS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">only the additional solidification told of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the added apparatus's work. Abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bruce drove home a plunger switch. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty humming roar echoed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great auditorium, the straining pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the matter-giant, as the entire struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of the Universe was altered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one small fraction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it died, died as abruptly as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come. On the stage the sixth form</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumpled slowly to the floor. The five</seg><seg type="columnLine">others started back in amazement and</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror--then rushed forward to pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hands through the spot where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">material, physical body now lay. Bruce</seg><seg type="columnLine">had set up a new electron-wave pattern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and instantaneously the electrons, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">protons, then atoms that had made up</seg><seg type="columnLine">that girl's body, simply WEREN'T</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they had been, but in a new posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion--on Freedom Hall stage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Grant was kneeling over the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained figure. She was moaning no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer. Bruce joined him, tense and</seg><seg type="columnLine">white. Slowly, the doctor turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face up to Bruce. "I'm sorry Bruce--</seg><seg type="columnLine">life is too marvelously delicate a balance</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the titanic forces you need to hurl</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter out of existence, and back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence elsewhere. It was not her con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition. The vitameter shows that every</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual cell is dead, even the lowest</seg><seg type="columnLine">types, the hair cells and finger nail</seg><seg type="columnLine">cells--though that may be because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they did to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think that you have set yourself</seg><seg type="columnLine">an impossible task, Bruce. How much</seg><seg type="columnLine">power did you use in doing this?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Three and one-half hundred billion</seg><seg type="columnLine">horsepower hours. I killed her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She would thank you Bruce, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that. But don't you see that such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a titanic power--more than even this</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole city uses in a year--is too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">for life to be associated with?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"When will Lora wake, Grant?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Bruce softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grant looked at his wristwatch, "She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">should wake about now or soon, Bruce."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will bring her--when she wakes."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly Bruce sat down. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the great machine with dull eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Utter quiet reigned in Freedom Hall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">A pair of soft-shod hospital attendants</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, and covered the body on the stage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Softly they carried it away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every eye seemed turned on them as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they walked unhindered through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">immaterial images that were dashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly about on the stage, noiseless, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">real.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Bruce began to laugh, softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with such genuine merriment, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Grant turned to him with a face</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly whiter and more drawn than</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. Bruce looked up at him with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling, teasing face. There was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing insane in that face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I'm all right Grant. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing's all right!

But just think--look."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AGAIN Bruce was at the controls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">-Lx In an instant the scene had shifted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was Lora's cell now, the girl stirring</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly to consciousness on her bed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bruce projected himself, and his image</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent over by the side of Lora's bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lora," he said, "Lora dear--it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bruce." Slowly the lids raised, the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashes curved upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bruce--the joke worked, didn't it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">She paused, suddenly fuller conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness returned, and the laughing glint in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes changed. They were suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">very intent and thoughful. "Bruce, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you call me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I called you Lora--Lora, dear. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you mind?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh--," sudden animation came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. She sat up abruptly, clutching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket to her. "Then--then I'm not--</seg><seg type="columnLine">your laboratory assistant."</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bruce laughed softly. "I suppose you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are--but that's not all, you see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that point settled, other things</seg><seg type="columnLine">could reach Lora's consciousness. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw for the first time the steel bars that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been there when she dropped off</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the long sleep. "Bruce--where am</seg><seg type="columnLine">I? In the same place?" There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fright in her voice now. "IVe been</seg><seg type="columnLine">here two days? You couldn't get in?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not till five minutes ago, Lora. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have now, though. I can transport mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter entire by the process, transport it</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as I can project an image of nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal size."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you can get me out?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cloud came over his face. "No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lora, I have tried it, and it won't trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port life. Dr. Grant says the forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">involved are too mighty for life to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dure. I tried once, but--but the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment failed. It's all right though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because you see, dear, no substance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the Universe can endure these forces.</seg><seg type="columnLine">See, your bars." Bruce's image van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished from the cell, but there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden enormous tension, a tension that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to draw at her very soul. Quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a sound, the great steel door</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolved away--quietly as the noiseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships of the Freedom Union--the quiet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the Matter Giant at work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bruce reappeared. "I have other</seg><seg type="columnLine">work to do with this now. Omallin</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't surrender. I couldn't break</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his magnetic defenses without</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocking earth to her heart. So now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must leave you for a brief while,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear, while I finish the work. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will bring you a white robe of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Freedom Union, and a telectroscope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the twin tubes before I go though."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He melted away again, and where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been, a white robe, a small telectro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope, and the twin pistols of the Free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom Union came gently into existence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laughing in her heart, Lora rose, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fat Omallin was quivering and order-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and shrieking threats and vengeance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two score Polshins, most of them young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polshin Guardsmen, were watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">performance with growing signs of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gust. The more Omallin realized their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feelings, the more their barbs penetrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thick intellectual hide, the more he</seg><seg type="columnLine">disintegrated. His eyes were wide and</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened in their folds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually a cold silence fell about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and his voice died slowly into sil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence too. Steady, hard-eyed gazes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent on him. These young men saw in</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for the first time the weakness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">degeneracy that he represented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A low voice spoke.

A solid some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing turned him aside at the doorway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed him, forced him toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power room. Whimpering, his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">glazed with a cold sweat, he was forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">along. There was solidity in the image</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, not absolute solidity, but enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to force him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind him trailed some forty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polshin Guardsmen.

There was a great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth, humming roar here. Rivers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold water, nearly five million gallons a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute, were rushing through the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumps.

The soul-wrench-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing tension built up, and suddenly there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a terrible, ear-tearing scream, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream as of a living animal in pain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The outlines of the first of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators faded away, in its deep in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior they could see the burning fires.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then--the fires blossomed in a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion of heat and light for the bil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lionth part of a second, a vast flower</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blue-violet flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there was nothing.

Ten times the whole vast N'yak</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fortress shuddered to them and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her cell fifteen floors above, Lora smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she heard them.

"I'm going to take two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pump battery now." Omallin realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly that the solid thing had released</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.

Here there were half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny business buildings strung out along</seg><seg type="columnLine">two sides of the dusty highway, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">score or so of cottage residences scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered about^ and beyond those, monoton-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous prairie in all directions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were two general stores; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in the brick building was carelessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">run and had a poor stock; the other was</seg><seg type="columnLine">better arranged and more ambitious, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">its wooden, gable-roofed shack looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost ready to collapse in upon it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The garage was the busiest and most sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tematic-looking place in the neighbor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood. Two "cafes" (in reality soft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink parlors), one ragged and catering</seg><seg type="columnLine">to coarsely dressed men, one somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaner and filled at noon with high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">school students; a hardware store with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty windows and a heap of nondescript</seg><seg type="columnLine">junk within them covered with the undis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•	turbed dust of years; a drug-store with</seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">its window full of patent-medicine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cosmetic posters mottled by fading, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave John an indescribably dreary feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of lostness and futility. The traffic</seg><seg type="columnLine">that slipped down the highway all day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the color and activity of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">filling stations, Standard Oil at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">end and Conoco at the other, did but</seg><seg type="columnLine">little to relieve him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bank itself made John think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little toy banks that children play</seg><seg type="columnLine">with; and when he first set eyes on it</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was sure that it must have a slot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top to drop nickels in. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">square, somewhat larger than a garage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with white-painted drop-siding and a flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof* Within, it had iron bars across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the windows, a single room divided in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two by a counter with a rusty iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">grill, a big iron safe set on wheels. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor was unpainted and splintery; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ink in the bottle on the sloping-topped</seg><seg type="columnLine">table at the door, was dry and caked, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pad of deposit slips upon it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow and curled with age. Hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone passed along the little street all</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, and only rarely stepped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank itself. Between two and three in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon there were a few mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chants ; Saturday evenings there might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be three or four farmers in the bank all</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JOHN smiled when he first saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. Providing there were any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to take, it would be the simplest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and easiest of tasks for the modem</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank-robber to clean the place out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away. It certainly looked as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">there might be something to take. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle Jake Bloor's huge, sprawling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white house brooded over the village</seg><seg type="columnLine">like some coarse temple; and his big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbing cars glittered back and forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the city, boasting insolently of</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. It seemed especially insolent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">John, because he knew there were count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less unemployed who did not know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where their next meal was coming from,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and countless others who were ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost fiat to the earth by debts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">losses at this particular time, while his</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle lorded it about without a care in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world nor a thought for others. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not seem fair that this crude, heartless</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, who had never done the world any</seg><seg type="columnLine">material service, but had only selfishly</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinched off for himself generous por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of the world's money which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had handled, should be rolling in safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">and luxury, at a time when men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had invented and built and taught and</seg><seg type="columnLine">organized were being faced with grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">want. Things weren't right in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">John was young and human. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot blame him, therefore, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that when he did eventually get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work to devise some scientific means for</seg><seg type="columnLine">preventing a robbery of the bank, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his motive did not consist of any over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelming loyalty to his uncle's bank. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did .it merely because he took pleasure in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creation of something that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">operate. The abstract idea in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, when the concrete working out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it does things that can be seen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt--that is the thrill of the creative</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit. John loved his figures and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawings; he loved the coils and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storage batteries, the clicking little gears</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the quick little switches that tickled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made swift little movements of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own accord, as though they were living</seg><seg type="columnLine">and intelligent things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For many long, luxurious weeks he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did nothing; it was a delight to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely a sort of vegetable; to rest from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rush of the last weeks in school; to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed completely, if temporarily, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain of looking into the future. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind hibernated during that time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay fallow; for it required no effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharge his simple duties as clerk at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank; and life in Centerville was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent anesthetic.

Long letters to and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Dorothy punctuated the soothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">monotony, and the thrill they gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all the excitement he wanted. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been good letters, as we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have judged could we have but seen him</seg><seg type="columnLine">9lip off into solitude on the first oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity after their arrival, his face break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out in delightful smiles--only no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one saw him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, one day in the fall, after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat of the summer was out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones, he began to get ambitious.

And, as four months writing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">applications all Over the country hasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">got me an answer, where would I be</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a job?

Packages in corrugated</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper and wooden boxes arrived for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at the little railway station; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were a few automobile trips to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the thing was finished, it dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered vastly from the usual burglary</seg><seg type="columnLine">protection equipment. Nevertheless it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite simple. The keynote of it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a row of photo-electric cells just above</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, which received daylight from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window behind him, and permitted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady flow of current from a storage</seg><seg type="columnLine">battery, whose charge was maintained by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trickle charger from the lighting cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent. This storage-battery current held</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a relay armature.

Those who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned by the alarm came too late</seg><seg type="columnLine">or did not have nerve enough to inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fere. In one case the accomplices on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside had found it a convenient</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning to help them get away, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another they had held all the arrivals at</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay, and made a good getaway with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">MILLIONS FOR DEFENSE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">booty. John discarded the idea of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm bell to awaken the village, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked for an improvement on it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A drum of tear-gas supplied the solu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. One of the motors operated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the relay was so arranged as to shoot a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast of tear-gas right across the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the bank room, just where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold-up men would be standing. A tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone-pair to the city fourteen miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, rented at two dollars a month,</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprised the next step; over these</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires he arranged for an automatic sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal in the sheriff's office, which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">announce that the bank was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbed, just as soon as the storage-bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery current was cut off by the raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands in front of the photo-electric cells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A second motor set off by the relay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">located in a box under the building,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the outside door and shot an iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar across it to keep it closed. John</seg><seg type="columnLine">also reinforced this street door by screw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to it a latticework of iron straps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and painting them neatly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt highly thrilled the evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he gave the apparatus its first trial.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tried it after dark, and therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to put a strong electric-light bulb</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the street window to replace day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, and instead of tear-gas he used a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drum of compressed air. He rehearsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole scene in his mind: the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst open by masked men, the pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck in his face, and demand: "Hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">up!'* He put his hands up in as natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">a manner as possible, and his delight</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew no bounds to hear the relay click,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so softly that no one not looking for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could possibly have caught it; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">even moderately startled at the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud hiss of escaping air, and the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">door slammed shut in a ghostly man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. He walked around in front of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">window in the latticework on the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, and felt the compressed air from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tank still blowing right across the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the imagined robber was standing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That ought to have been enough. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was amply sufficient to take care of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbery that might have been staged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But John had a third motor at hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some vague idea in his head. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still something lacking, though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not quite put his finger on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack. For several days he was uneasy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the half-emerging thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was still something that he ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to add to this. But, try as he might,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing further occurred to him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangement, as he had it, seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, and that was all he could think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He therefore demonstrated it to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle one evening. Jake Bloor said</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, which was unusual for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was rarely silent. It may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant that he was impressed; it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">not. He did manage to keep the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptuous look on his heavy red face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he walked out without having said a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word. The next morning he threw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper sneeringly across the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">at John, who was eating with his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent down, thinking of Dorothy. John</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at the captions announcing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">another bank had been robbed, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank clerk, who had been in league</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the robbers, had handed out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">booty and wras also under arrest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Good idea!" drawled Jake through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nose. "Combine that with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan. Load up the robbers nicely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then turn on your tricks. With a gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask you can take the swag off them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hide it before the police come-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IOHN heard no more. His mind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy again. He saw the danger to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. And, as never before, he ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served the paltry meanness of his uncle's</seg><seg type="columnLine">character. There was some deep sublety</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Jake Boor's sarcastic persecution of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earnest, ambitious boy, which John</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not comprehend. That Jake hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">John seemed to be clear. But why? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">why had he gotten him there apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his mercy for the purpose of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into trouble? The only thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">John had to go on was that his uncle's</seg><seg type="columnLine">old, patriarchial conception of the "hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">or" of the family had been hurt when</seg><seg type="columnLine">John's mother had run off and married</seg><seg type="columnLine">a poor but clever mechanic. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the eyes of all her relatives a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mortal sin, not even possible of expi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation by her unoffending son.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But, John's mind ran more to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanisms than to the tangled personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">relationships of the family. A few days</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hard thinking convinced him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was only one way to protect him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, and that was to include himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the field of the tear-gas. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to take his medicine at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant as did the rest of them. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">October afternoon, out on one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">walks, he strode down the highway into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dusty sunset, and ahead of him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmer was raising a tremendous dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a field, getting together, with a horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">hay rake, a lot of old weeds for burning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the farmer moved his lever and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled his lines, the row of curved steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">tines beneath him poised and waited,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then pounced upon their prey, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">John got an idea. He thought of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">use for his third motor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was soon busy again in his im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">provised workshop, putting together two</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs that resembled big hayrakes, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">as tall as a man; but the tines were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid steel, and when they closed toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other, they could grip a man as</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly as a huge steel claw, and hold him</seg><seg type="columnLine">immovable. He installed these, one on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each side of his teller's window at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter, with the motor under the floor so</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged that it could rotate them against</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other and slip them past a catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would lock them firmly together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the photo-electric relay went off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone standing in front of the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be raked in, clutched, and held in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a steel fist, six feet tall. Yet, when these</seg><seg type="columnLine">claws were turned back out of the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted with bronze paint, they mingled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the bronzed grillwork of the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, and were hardly noticeable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some time Jake Bloor had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking of taking a trip West for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">several weeks' stay. There was no men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the purpose of the trip, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was discussed in a sort of secretive</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, causing John to half suspect that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his uncle might be bound on a bootleg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging expedition. But he cast it out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind, considering that it was none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his business. He was too worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway, to think of that, by Jake's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern admonitions about bank affairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John was thoroughly frightened for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake Bloor held him closely responsible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the veriest trifles as well as for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">largest affairs, and yet had not properly</seg><seg type="columnLine">inducted him into an adequate knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bank's affairs. It was an unfair</seg><seg type="columnLine">position for John, and he felt like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindfolded man walking a tightrope</seg><seg type="columnLine">across a chasm; he was just trusting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck that nothing went wrong before</seg><seg type="columnLine">his uncle returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't pass up any good loans," his</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle growled at the breakfast table on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day of his departure.

After the briefest college educa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion a student had ever received with</seg><seg type="columnLine">high graduation honors at Bloomfield, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had retired to his family home which</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in a great pile of stone and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crete at the very end of a lonely street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There he had begun his life's work and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his townsmen seldom saw him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went about his work with a cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">indifference that immediately character-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized him for just what he was&gt; a cold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">undemonstrative man.

But he made no attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch her. He just stood at his labor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atory bench and feasted his sunken eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon her.

But he had no near</seg><seg type="columnLine">relatives who might contest his will or</seg><seg type="columnLine">demand an investigation into his death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For that he was thankful, for he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to tie up his fortune in litigation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wanted to spend some of it on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">honeymoon to Europe with Dot Faver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sham!

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">might get curious during the transmuta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and spoil it all.

That's the plan! I will let</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Faversham have that day off to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop. I think a pre-wedding present of,</seg><seg type="columnLine">say a hundred dollars, ought to keep her</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from here. Then when she comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to work, she'll simply find my old</seg><seg type="columnLine">body while I, as Herbert Strong, will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my school waiting developments!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He might have settled back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed with satisfaction at his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunning. But Dr. Lape was too tired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fagged out from his nights of painstak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing labors, to laugh. It was not in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature to be gay, even with himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What he did do, however, was to snatch</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a health magazine that lay in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rack attached to his chair and thumb</seg><seg type="columnLine">coolly through the pages, until he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a picture of Herbert Strong printed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one of them. Then a gloating look</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang into his sunken eyes. The pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of a strong, masculine body had</seg><seg type="columnLine">always fascinated him, and how he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to have such a body as his very</seg><seg type="columnLine">own! Now, thanks to his own genius,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was within the realms of possibility.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More than that, it was about to ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terialize into more than longing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he sat staring at the picture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strong, who was posed like Atlas with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world on his broad shoulders, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy to see that Dr. Merton Lape con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">templated something untoward. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no inscrutable mask now. His sunk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en eyes gleamed murder. And he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder to possess a body like that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herbert Strong and a girl like Dot</seg><seg type="columnLine">Faversham for his bride! Strangely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, he never paused to consider</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">what crime he might commit in stealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body of Herbert Strong. In tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his own life as he planned to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">*it, there seemed no crime. If there was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who could prove that a crime had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">committed ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Until he heard Dot spring the latch on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front door, he sat gloating silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the picture. Hearing her, he quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid the magazine aside and stepped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of his big test tubes. There she</seg><seg type="columnLine">found him studying the contents of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a cheery "Good Morning, Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lape" she deposited her wraps in a lab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oratory closet, flung back a vagrant red</seg><seg type="columnLine">curl with a deft touch and stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly to his side. Already garbed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solid white of her profession, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ready for work. And much to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment she received a broad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheery smile from her employer. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time he had smiled in, let her</seg><seg type="columnLine">see now--two months! But Dr. Lape</seg><seg type="columnLine">could afford to smile at his best now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isn't a man's intended bride entitled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smile from him occasionally?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good morning, Miss Faversham!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rasped cheerily. "I have been waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you. There is much to be done to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day and the work must fall upon you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have been troubled with insomnia lately</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I am very tired. I will outline your</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties and retire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You look very fatigued, Dr. Lape,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she smiled back sympathetically. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been working too hard. I am glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see that you have not resorted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">opiates as often happens with worn-out</seg><seg type="columnLine">physicians. I shall follow any instruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions you give me for the day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good, Miss Faversham," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">running his practiced eyes over the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject in the tube. That subject would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have filled a layman or laywoman with</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick horror, for it was, in their en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirety, the internal organs of a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">128</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">being, living, breathing and feeding with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same regularity as any confined in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal body! But Dot Faversham was</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to such things since com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into Dr, Lape's employ. "I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete confidence in you," Lape con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued. "You have constantly proven</seg><seg type="columnLine">your ability to handle any situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">that arises among my experimental sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects. This time, however, it will re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quire your utmost skill to keep alive</seg><seg type="columnLine">Subject Number 3 in this tube. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been observing unquestionable signs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trichina in the muscles about the heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Today the symptoms are more pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced and the first thing you must do</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to begin treating the subject. You re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">call that I explained to you thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that trichinosis is the curse of humans</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swine. The nematoid parasites in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this subject's heart tissues and muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be removed. Do you think you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of doing it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have removed them on several oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casions from Subject 5, Dr. Lape," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said earnestly. "I can manage quite well</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. Now you run along and get some</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest. I understand the situation per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good, Miss Faversham," he rasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, wearily. "I know you do. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-day and to-morrow you will give your</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire attention to Subject 3. If it</seg><seg type="columnLine">shows no improvement, we shall re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">move it from the solution and perform a</seg><seg type="columnLine">general removal of the parasites."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dot looked at him a bit disappoint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was going to beg off duty to-mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row, Dr. Lape," she said quietly. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember Fm to be married this month,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the 20th, to be exact, I have some</seg><seg type="columnLine">last minute shopping to do-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How stupid of me, Miss Faver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sham!" Dr. Lake rasped. "Here, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best assistant I ever had is going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be married and like a stupid ass I failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show some consideration!" Inwardly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he was smiling contentedly. Things were</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing into his hands. "Of course you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have a day off!" he added. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you make it day after tomorrow, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will give you a little pre-wedding gift</seg><seg type="columnLine">that may help you to buy the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary for a June bride!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, Dr. Lapet" she beamed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are very considerate. It will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">day after tomorrow, then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excellent!" he said, pulling out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">check book and scrawling in his bold</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand a check on his bank. "Here is</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to show my keen appreciation</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your helpful assistance during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past years. I have made it out to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">for five hundred."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Five hundred dollars?" she accepted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the check in amazement. "Aren't you a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit extravagant* Dr. Lape?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a bit of it!" he laughed. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like a cold cackle. "If I had paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">you near what you are worth, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have been too much! Take it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoy yourself with my heartiest com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pliments !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He promptly turned away, leaving her</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing at the test tube, staring in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credulously at the check. It would more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than pay for her trousseau and the kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a colorful wedding she had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted. At the door he paused, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her cravingly and spoke again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would please me immensely, Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Faversham," he rasped cunningly, "to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you and your fiance dine with me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-morrow evening--just a little pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nuptial dinner. Can you arrange it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We shall be delighted, Dr. Lape;"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she enthused, wondering if all the while</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been mistaken in her presump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that he was a man without a heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I shall phone Herbert this morning and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make sure. It is very kind of you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good!" Lape rasped. His sunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes gleamed. "I have wanted to offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">my congratulations to your fiance. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow evening, then?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BODY PIRATE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">129</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," she replied. "We shall be</seg><seg type="columnLine">here at eight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waddled away. But Dr. Lape had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no thought of retiring. Much work was</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet to be done before the fatal hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his deformed body would be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead and his powerful, cunning brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">assume control over the superbly per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect body of Herbert Strong. He took</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself immediately to his secret lab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oratory. There the strange canines</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissed at him like angry felines. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cats barked and the two monkeys chat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered through their bars. His first acts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to get rid of them. It would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">do to leave such evidence of his handi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">work and scientific skill behind to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demn him. He promptly chloroformed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and dumped the bodies into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste chute that carried them into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring furnace in the cellar. He al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways did things thoroughly and he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thorough job of burning his bridges</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him. As for the disposal of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fifth Dimension Surgical apparatus, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">intricate and astounding an instrument</seg><seg type="columnLine">of science as man had ever conceived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which stood on a small table encased in</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass, well, time enough to get rid of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the transferring. That would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first task falling to the new Herbert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strong! *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spent the balance of the day de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroying all other evidence and in fram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his will and last testament. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening, after Dot had been driven away</seg><seg type="columnLine">by her fiance, a local notary was called</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mansion to attest to the legality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the document. Thereafter, until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following evening, time hung heavy on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands. He found sleep impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his excitement and anticipation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely molding himself with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">usurped body of another man. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided the laboratory, afraid to trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in the presence of Dot Faver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sham, lest she notice the trembling of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and grow suspicious. But when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">evening came again, he had complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">control over himself. An injection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drugs into his skinny arm saw to that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the quiet little dinner he had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first opportunity to study Herbert Strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">at close quarters and was immensely</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied with what he saw. In an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maculate tuxedo, Herbert Strong re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">newed his envy. He had the body-build</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a Greek god and in contrast with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own distorted frame, he was a veritable</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant As they ate he silently studied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape and size of his large head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked his satisfaction with an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never before had he seen Dot Faver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sham look so beautiful. Her golden hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">was set off effectively by her silver eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning grown. More than ever he felt his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to possess her, and more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever he meant to do so. Much to Dot's</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement he proved to be a perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">host and he had given her a dinner that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have graced the table of the rich-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est family in the city. But. Dr. Lape</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a man of many servants. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had only his housekeeper, a gentle, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderate old lady who had been his per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal nurse during his childhood. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was constantly at their service and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to take a keen delight in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dinner finally over they retreated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the library where they discussed casual</seg><seg type="columnLine">topics, until Dr. Lape cunningly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected the subject of physical culture</seg><seg type="columnLine">training into the conversation. Instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herbert Strong became alert. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested him more, unless it was Dot</seg><seg type="columnLine">Faversham, than his owm profession. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, Dr. Lape quickly learned, his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligion. He believed in it devoutly as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect cure for many of man's minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">ailments. To this the scientist agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">without comment. And when the party</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke up he had Herbert Strong's prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ise to come at nine o'clock the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, to see what, could be done to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">130</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ward strengthening his distorted body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His guests gone, Dr. Merton Lape</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbed his bony hands contentedly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped out of his tuxedo and donned a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smock. With infinite care he carried his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fifth Dimension Surgery apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">downstairs to the main laboratory where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he set it up at the head of two qperating</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables placed side by side. After check-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it over carefully he retired to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, chuckling contentedly to himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his dry, rasping cackle. For hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereafter he lay on his bed and visioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself enjoying, as Herbert Strong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything life had denied him. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost dawn when he fell into a fitful</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. It gave him little rest and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">awoke to find the turning point of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life close at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True to his promise, Herbert Strong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having hiked from town for the exer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cise, rang the doorbell promptly at nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock. Dr/Lape himself answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good morning, Herbert!" he greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all the cheeriness he could muster.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'*1 see you are a man of promptness. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">like promptness.

My assistant</seg><seg type="columnLine">is on hand at the gym to handle my</seg><seg type="columnLine">clients there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He entered the mansion as incau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously as a fly might dart into the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible web of a spider. Dr. Lape, forti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied for the occasion by an injection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mild drugs, let him into the laboratory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His sallow face was a mask again, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutable, cold. His sunken eyes glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered in their deep sockets like chips of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue glacial ice. And he was, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">undue preliminaries, ready to handle the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation as promptly and thoroughly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did everything else. Hidden in one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of his bony hands was a small hypo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dermic needle. He stepped aside to al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low his victim to enter first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The instant Herbert Strong passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the door of the laboratory he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt something sharp prick his right arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With an involuntary grunt he glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulder to see his supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">client leering at him with hypodermic</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle poised as if for another jab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you stick me with that thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor ?" he tried hard to grin jokingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his astonishment. "What is this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a joke?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is no joke, Herbert," Dr. Lape</seg><seg type="columnLine">rasped, watching his eyes closely. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready they had become glassy. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled contentedly. . "You don't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had you come here just to try to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength in the distorted thing I call my</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, do you? You ought to know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is impossible, or do you, my friend?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course I know it, Lape!" Herb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensing danger flung back. He ran a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling hand across his forehead. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was covered with sweat, an unmistakable</seg><seg type="columnLine">indication of weakness emanating from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the powerful drug that had been in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected into his blood. "But it's not my</seg><seg type="columnLine">business to deny anybody the right to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my services. What's the idea?

He made a feeble at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to grab at his tormentor's throat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his clutching fists fell far short of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mark. He slumped down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, feeling as if he were falling rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly into a bottomless, stygian pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chuckling, Dr. Lape quickly locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. Then with an amazing exhi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bition of strength for such a twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">body as his own, he lifted up the inert</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of his victim upon one of the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erating tables. As if impatient to pos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sess that superbly perfect physique as his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">very own, he worked speedily, yet with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an expertness born of long practice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the silent form of Herbert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strong once on the table and at his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete mercy, he lost no time. His sallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was distorted into a covetous mask</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. His sunken eyes blazed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of a look that might have been ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected of a miser. Quickly he placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a metal helmet over the other's skull,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making sure that its internal electrodes</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted snuggly against his frontal, parietal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and occipital lobes! Other electrodes, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">such they were, fitted firmly against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull directly over the cerebrum and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerebellum. Along the seams of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cranial bones ran literally dozens of</seg><seg type="columnLine">other small discs to which were attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">as many tiny tubes and wires connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Fifth Dimension Surgery devise</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the tables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Fifth Dimension Surgery ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus was something in itself to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spire wonder. To the layman it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have looked like some sort of a scales.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But instead of having saucer like pans</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its metal arms, it had ball-coils. No-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body but Dr. Lape understood or could</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain its intricate details, though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was easily seen to derive its strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">power from electrical energy. In truth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did, but in vibration only. Dr. Lape</seg><seg type="columnLine">had discovered the Fifth Dimension in</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical vibrations and into this appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atus he had embodied them, accomplish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as a result, the impossible transmuta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of matter from one body to another</seg><seg type="columnLine">without blood, scars or other tell-tale</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence of an operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As delicate and fragile as some min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iature Swiss watch movement, the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strument was filled with tiny coil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">springs, pendulums and platinum wires.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under each of the two ball-coils was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, green, vacuum tube which appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently controlled the vibrations as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the dual helmets, the one already</seg><seg type="columnLine">132</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">snugly fixed on Herbert Strong's skull</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other which Dr. Lape was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit over his own head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One might wonder how the transmu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation could be performed without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistance of a third person. But Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lape had seen to that. The whole thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be controlled by an amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">robot switch-timed by a stationary</seg><seg type="columnLine">chronometer. An amazing, brilliant man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Dr. Lape, and he overlooked noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, as was his custom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Satisfied that the helmet was at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached perfectly to Herbert Strong's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, he promptly placed himself on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other table. Sitting there, he donned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second helmet. Perfectly calm, su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">premely confident and fearless as to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outcome of his piracy of another man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, he coolly jabbed his skinny arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hypodermic needle, then turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the robot switch. Everything was set</seg><seg type="columnLine">now for the transmutation, even to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight mis-adjustment of the wires that</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled all life on his table. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly aware that when the robot had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone the cycle of its time, he alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a dead man. But Herbert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strong would be alive and in his cranium</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be his, Dr. Lape's, own super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The instant he turned on the robot</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch, the Fifth Dimension Surgery ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus went into action. The twin vac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uum tubes glowed softly, The ball-coils</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to vibrate, gathering momentum</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually. Pendulums swung, slowly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, then rapidly as seconds ticked off</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the chronometer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Dr. Lape succumbed to his injec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of drugs, he felt a strange vibratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement in his brain, as if the Fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dimension apparatus was painlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosening the tissues and preparing it</seg><seg type="columnLine">for transmutation. With a smile on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin, colorless lips, he became inert, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fident that when he awoke he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in full possession of a new and superbly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect body. And Dot Faversham,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">unsuspectingly, would be waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with open arms!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the vibrations tugged at Herbert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strong's brain, he grew tense. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong constitution was fighting at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drugs that the other had so ruthlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and treacherously injected into his blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream. Vaguely he was aware that</seg><seg type="columnLine">something was wrong. As the vibrations</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased he felt a severe, deadening</seg><seg type="columnLine">ache at the base of his skull. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupor he tried to figure out what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong with him, but got nowhere in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction. Yet he was sure something</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tugging at his brain, as if some in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible instruments were cutting its tis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sues and nerve centers and pulling it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of suction from his skull,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sever stab of pain suddenly struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the backs of his eyes. He wrenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if shot and as he did so he rolled clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the table. The helmet was yanked</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his head. It clattered on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor beside him, rolled a few inches and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into contact with the metal legs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table. Instantly there was a blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash from the laboratory. Green flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiggled and crackled over Dr. Lape's</seg><seg type="columnLine">great Fifth Dimension Surgical appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atus. Platinum wires melted. The green</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacuum tubes burned bright for an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant and exploded. The distorted body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Dr. Lape twitched on his table. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscle in his withered body seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tighten. Suddenly he relaxed with a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal sigh. His sunken eyes opened wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his jaw sagged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Merton Lape had finally made an</seg><seg type="columnLine">error! Thorough in all things as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been, he had overlooked one thing!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Time! Time and Herbert Strong's pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erful constitution! He should have ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ministered another dose of his drug to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man whose body he had so pains-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takingly labored to steal.

He lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor in a nauseating stupor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that he was there, yet having little</seg><seg type="columnLine">or no control over his faculties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Short-circuited by the contact of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet with the leg of the table, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fifth Dimension Surgical device went</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in smoke, its fragile machinery melt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into worthless masses as it did so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Lape might have strapped the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his intended victim to the table and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevented such a catastrophe. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been aware that such a precau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionary measure would have rendered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him helpless after the transmutation. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been unable to loosen him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self ! His own distorted body dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herbert Strong would have been com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled to lie on the table, helplessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">strapped, to await the coming of Dot</seg><seg type="columnLine">Faversham to free him. The cat would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have escaped the bag then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just how long he lay on the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herbert Strong had no way of knowing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His wrist-watch had been smashed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fall. It seemed that he had lain</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for ages before he suddenly heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shriek of an auto horn somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside. It was the horn of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">car which he had loaned to Dot that</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, her own auto being tempo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarily out of commission. She was to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him at the Lape mansion at noon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once again the horn blared out its call.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He struggled to rise like a drunken man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His senses reeled and all the strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have fled from his powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs. His head ached violently and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes felt as if they had been jabbed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">needles. He managed to get to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees and then he collapsed back. Out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side Dot tooted again a bit impatiently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he could only get a drink of water to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet his burning lips and throat! He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tried again to rist only to sink back with</seg><seg type="columnLine">swimming senses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wondering if something was wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the big house, or if her fiance had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already left the place and returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">town, Dot hurried to the front door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and admitted herself with her own key.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inside, the place was quiet as a tomb.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herb's cap, hanging on a rack in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall, caught her eyes. She knew then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was still in the house, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man seldom walks off leaving his hat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She went straight to the library. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was deserted. She wondered where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">housekeeper was. But Dr. Lape had</seg><seg type="columnLine">also given her a day off that he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have absolute privacy during the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inspired with the idea that the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men might be in the laboratory, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">went there. The door was locked. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">she inserted her key she heard a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">groan from within. Sensing something</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong, she hastily flung open the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly she saw Herbert Strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling gamely to attain his feet. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed in with a cry of alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Herbert!" she cried anxiously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What has happened?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at her stupidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Water!" he muttered. "Get me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink, Dot, please!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She ran quickly past the tables toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faucet. As she did so she had her</seg><seg type="columnLine">first glimpse of Dr. Lape. She needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one passing glance at his face to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell her he was dead! His jaw sagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes were popped wide open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stifled a sob, snatched up a glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">and filled it from the faucet. Herb</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strong gulped its contents in a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallow. From a medicine chest she</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed a bottle of smelling salts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strength returned swiftly to Herb's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body under its powerful effect. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped him up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What has happened, Herbert?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">134</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded again, glancing at Dr, Lape</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shuddering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've got me there, Dot!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, holding his aching head in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. "I don't know, except that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lape had a crazy idea that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to steal my body! Imagine such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an insane idea? He was going to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">move my brain and put his own in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">place! Then he was going to marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">you! That's all I know, except that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the minute he got me in here he jabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with a hypodermic needle. I just</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed out until I saw, or thought I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw, a blinding flash of light. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found myself on the floor. Since then</seg><seg type="columnLine">i've been wondering if he actually did</seg><seg type="columnLine">transplant his brain into my head! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess he didn't, for I recognized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of my car hom when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">tooted it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" Dot gasped in astonishment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How terrible! I might have known he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was up to something! He was working</seg><seg type="columnLine">at nights! I'll bet he was working on</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to make it possible for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to steal your body! That's what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant when he told me there might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a way out for him after he had proposed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">marriage to me and was promptly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did he propose to you, Dot?"

Congratulations</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Editorials each month. They arc very</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting. Now for the stories. "Life Ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasting" by David H. Kellar, M. D., was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful story, "The Velocity of Escape" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Moon Pirates/' two fine interplanetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">tales. Also "The Master Minds of Venus."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Pool of Life" by P. Schuyler Miller de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serves recognition. Really unusual. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moon Waits," another distinctive interplan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etary narrative. A. S. seems to have gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">"space conscious" (1?) Well more power to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, for what is more amazing than the undis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered mysteries that lurk in the dark void of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"outer-space." So come on you space-travel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling authors, keep us in touch with the discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eries of your imagination. And last but by</seg><seg type="columnLine">no means least, "Through the Andes" by</seg><seg type="columnLine">A. Hyatt Verrill, has at last drawn to a glorious</seg><seg type="columnLine">climax, a wonderful tale while it lasted. I also</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoyed "Eighty-Five and Eighty-seven/' and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Noekken of Norway." "Land of Twilight,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">er--ah another space tale, promises to be good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now for some war (I?). Challenge accepted!</seg><seg type="columnLine">choose your weapon. For the benefit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience (readers) I will repeat the chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenger's words (argument on the size of A.

S. and if disinte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grators were used, Ed. would have to sweep</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the ashes (heaven knows he has enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do outside of that). So the only thing left is</seg><seg type="columnLine">word9. Are you ready? all right. First of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out a pile of your "aristocrat" A. S. books.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now a pile of "undignified" sized ones. Set</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up between book ends, in two separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">piles, side by side. Now walk back five feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and view them. Isn't the smaller size neater</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking? Doesn't the tall pile look sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">er--skinny? what? Next, take one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"aristocrats" in your hands, doesn't it flap un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably over your hands if you hold it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle? And plop in the center when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold the ends?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now take one of the "undignified" ones and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold it.

Last of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">all compare the pages and number of stories.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And well, any way what difference does the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size make? A. S. will be good old A. S.</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether it be twelve inches high or six inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">high.

Well</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I want to know is why do they read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine at all.

That represents the number of protons</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the nucleus, as in a gold atom, 197.
