If we traced this</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling to its lair, we would perhaps have need</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a psychologist for the ultimate explanation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It will usually be found that the more sensitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">the person in question the greater the irritation. This type of</seg><seg type="columnLine">person is usually easily offended because it seems an insult</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his mentality that a certain fact exists anywhere in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe of which he has no knowledge. Often, also, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more highly learned a person is, the greater the irritation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus, when a scientist comes along with something totally</seg><seg type="columnLine">unorthodox--some new fact which may not be discernible as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact immediately--his fellow scientists are usually the ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">who become most irritated and loud in their denunciations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus it was with Galileo, when-he attempted to prove that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth did not stand still, but spun around on its axis--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a monstrous piece of "nonsense" in those days. It not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">went against the grain and all inborn instinct, but against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Church as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was, and still is true in the case of Einstein arrd his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theory of Relativity. Most of these theories have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">proven after many years of wrangling among scientists and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematicians, yet even today most of them are confirmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is true, also, of a certain class of Amazing Stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientifiction readers, a class, by the way. which we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy to state, seems to be in the minority. This class is</seg><seg type="columnLine">always ready to tear and claw at any author who comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with a new idea which, for the time being, may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrary to fact, although it may still lie within the realm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of science. Usually when such a scientifiction story is pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lished, the howl raised by this class of readers is long</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lusty, and most vitriolic. They give no quarter, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">are loud in their denunciations, and go to great lengths in</seg><seg type="columnLine">venting their opinions as to why such and such statement</seg><seg type="columnLine">could never come true. Yet. before the ink is dry, it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened that a scientifiction prediction has become a fact.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Undaunted, however, the Doubting Thomases are inclined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">close their eyes and minds against every fact and glibly say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We don't believe it anyhow." The old story of "There ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">no such animal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As has often been said, fact is stranger than fiction. If,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instance, we had published a scientifiction tale whereby</seg><seg type="columnLine">a musician, just by waving his hands in the air, without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical contacts of any kind, could produce the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful music imatrinahle, I know right well that we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been inundated with protests that such a thing is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical impossibility. Indeed, every scientist could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">given you dozens of good reasons why such a thing would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be entirely absurd, impossible, and just pure fiction. Never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless, in the current jssup of Science and Invention, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is described the apparatfemvented by L. Theremin, a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russian who uses radio "principles for his enthralling new</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of music.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In front of him stands a box containing certain radio in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struments. From the top of the box issues a rod, while at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left hand of the box is a brass ring. Just by waving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands in the vicinity' of the rod and ring, Mr. Theremin</seg><seg type="columnLine">produces the purest as well as the most beautiful kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">music that has ever been produced. The effect of the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">capacity of the human being is responsible for the music and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone can learn to play the instrument in short order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">providing he knows music. T-Onstrument gives forth flute-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like or violin sounds of the &gt;st exquisite beauty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A similar instrument, by the way, was used about two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago, in my so-called Pianorad, an instrument using</seg><seg type="columnLine">24 radio vacuum tubes, which 1 operate by means of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary piano keyboard, while the music issues from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud speaker the same as does the music of Theremin. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments are based upon the same principle, except where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I use an actual keyboard, Theremin uses his hands, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">now act as an electric condenser. Otherwise the principle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two apparatuses is the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then again, if one of our scientifiction authors had glibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">told us the havoc and destructiou that could be wrought by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound waves that could not be heard by the human ear, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would probably have promptly heard from amateur scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">and others. Yet, at a demonstration before the National</seg><seg type="columnLine">Academy of Sciences, by Professor R. W. Wood of Johns-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hopkins University, this scientist produced the most astound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing results with super sound waves, totally inaudible to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human ear. These sound waves, for instance, when acting</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon cracked ice, shook the ice to pieces in short order</seg><seg type="columnLine">and snow resulted. A fish in a glass bowl, when subjected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to these silent sound waves, is killed within several minutes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An ordinary candle, suspended in water, and influenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the super sound waves, is shaken into powder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water becomes a white milky fluid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stranger yet. if two metal plates, separated by a quartz</seg><seg type="columnLine">disc, and connectcd to the super sound wave instruments, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed in a beaker, the latter filled with oil, there is created</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of mound, while the oil will form a little mountain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay that way, as long as the super sound waves are turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. Not only that, but the top of the liquid oil mound will</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily support a weight of 5 ounces at its crest. All these</seg><seg type="columnLine">are facts, much stranger than fiction, and most of them have</seg><seg type="columnLine">never even been used or imagined by the average scientific-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion writer. If he had imagined them, and written his imagin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, he would probably have been quickly derided or worse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Hugo Gernsback speaks every Tuesday at 9.30 P.

Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was neither one nor the other of these patriotic</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunes, but what was undoubted by all was that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary sounds had seemed to descend from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky to the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What could it have been ?

There was no balloon and there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeronauts.

If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you hear in your house</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange and inexplicable</seg><seg type="columnLine">noises, do you not at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavor to discover the</seg><seg type="columnLine">e_ase ?

At one blow party politics dropped un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">« nOBUR THE CONQUEROR" was issued in 1S86,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> iV coincident with the earliest practical interest which</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to stir the zvorld in regard to the "conquest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air." With his usual boldly scientific imagination Verne,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having studied the question thoroughly from all sides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked into the future, formed a judgmtr.t, and pictured</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conquering air machine in the style he believed most</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to achieve success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his poetical climax Verne declares that Robur is "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit of the future"; and it is true that even to-day we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can build no machine to match the "Albatross." IVe have,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, far outdistanced the historical account of avia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion which Verne gives us in the course of his story, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which necessarily ceases with the early "eighties." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments of Professor Langley in Washington in 1896</seg><seg type="columnLine">started the world on toward a true knoivledge of the laws</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flight. Since then Count Zeppelin and a dozen others</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the "lighter than air" machines, and the Wright</seg><seg type="columnLine">brothers and a hundred others in those "heavier than air."</seg><seg type="columnLine">have achieved results which scarce any but Verne himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">had even dreamed of. when he wrote "Robur the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conqueror."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is interesting to note that for many years after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">publication of Verne's ideas, the contest between the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">'pchools, the Ughter-than-air, and the heavier-than-afr, has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been raging. The Zeppelinists in the meanwhile had their</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, while the airplane adherents had theirs. Yet it should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be noted that it is most likely that a machine of the Verne</seg><seg type="columnLine">type will in the end prevail. The Ughter-than-air machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Zeppelin type will probably never be tised com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercially to any great extent, due to their exceedingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">high cost, for one thing, and, second, due to the difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in navigating these huge monsters of the air. As for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verne's still more radically "heavy" ship, sustained aloft</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the direct lift of her screws, nothing in the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical has as yet been achieved in that line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nearly twenty years after writing "Robur," Jules Verne</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned again to the same theme; and in 1905, the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">year of his death, his faithful publishers, the Hetzels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued "The Master of the World." This is a sequel to</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Robur the Conqueror," and will be published by us im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately after "Robur." The sequel clearly evidences</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the inventive pozver of the aged master and his skill</seg><seg type="columnLine">in conceiving and portraying a dramatic climax remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">unimpaired even to the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the background of this story. Verne returns chiefly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the region of Lake Eric and Niagara, the tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">cataract which had so impressed him on his irisit to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly forty years before, and which he had described in</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Floating City."</seg><seg type="columnLine">828</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heeded--and the affairs of the world went on none</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worse for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what could this thing be? There was not an</seg><seg type="columnLine">observatory that was not applied to. If an observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory could not give a satisfactory answer, what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the use of observatories? If astronomers, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled and tripled the stars a hundred thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">million miles away, could not explain a phenomenon</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurring only a few miles off, what was the use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomers ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The observatory at Paris was very guarded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it said. In the mathematical section they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not thought the statement worth noticing; in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meridional section they knew nothing about it; in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the physical observatory they had not come across it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the geodetic section they had had no observation;</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the meteorological section there had been no rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ord; in the calculating room they had had nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to deal with. At any rate the confession was a frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, and the same frankness characterized the replies</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the observatory of Montsouris and the magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">station in the park of St. Maur. The same respect</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the truth distinguished the Bureau des Longi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tudes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The provinces were slightly more affirmative.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps in the night of the fifth and morning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixth of May there had appeared a flash of light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical origin which lasted about twenty seconds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the Pic du Midi this light appeared between nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ten in the evening. At the Meteorological Ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servatory on the Puy de Dome the light had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed between one and two o'clock in the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; at Mont Ventoux in Provence it had been seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">between two and three o'clock; at Nice it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed between three and four o'clock; while at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Semnoz Alps between Annecy, Le Bourget, and Le</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leman, it had been detected just as the zenith was</seg><seg type="columnLine">paling with the dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now it evidently would not do to disregard these</seg><seg type="columnLine">observations altogether. There could be no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a light had been observed at different places, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">succession, at intervals, during some hours. Hence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether it had been produced from many centers in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrestrial atmosphere, or from one center, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain that the light must have traveled at a speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">over one hundred and twenty miles an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the United Kingdom there was much per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexity. The observatories were not in agreement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greenwich would not consent to the proposition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oxford. They were agreed on one point, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that was: "It was nothing at all!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, said one, "It was an optical illusion!"

If</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did not hurl their objectives at each others'</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads, it was because they would have had to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">them back just when they most wanted to use them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In this much-disputed question the observatories of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington in the District of Columbia, and Cam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge in Massachusetts, found themselves opposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by those of Dartmouth College in New Hampshire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ann Arbor in Michigan.

That these people might</seg><seg type="columnLine">one day discover the method of guiding balloons is</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible.

A society of engineers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just been founded at Buffalo for working the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cataract.

He was a bachelor, he lived quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for his only servant had his valet Frycollin, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hardly worthy of being the servant to so auda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious a master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncle Prudent was rich, and therefore he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends, as was natural; but he also had enemies, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he was president of the club--among others</seg><seg type="columnLine">all those who envied his position. Amongst his bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest foes we may mention the secretary of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weldon Institute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was Phil Evans, who was also very rich, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the manager of the Wheelton Watch Company,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an important manufactory, which makes every day</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred movements equal in every respect to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swiss workmanship. Phil Evans would have passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one of the happiest men in the world, and even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States, if it had not been for Uncle Pru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent. Like him he was in his forty-sixth year; like</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, of invariable health; like him of undoubted</seg><seg type="columnLine">boldness. They were two men made to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other thoroughly, but they did not, for both</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of extreme violence of character. Uncle Pru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent was furiously hot; Phil Evans was abnormally</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And why had not Phil Evans been elected presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent of the club?

Twenty times</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been a scrutiny, and twenty times the ma-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jority had not declared for either one or the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The position was embarrassing, and it might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasted for the lifetime of the candidates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the members of the club then proposed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way out of the difficulty. This was Jem Chip, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasurer of the Weldon Institute. Chip was a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmed vegetarian, a proscriber of all animal nourish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, of all fermented liquors, half a Mussulman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a Brahman. On this occasion Jem Chip was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supported by another member of the club, William</seg><seg type="columnLine">T. Forbes, the manager of a large factory where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they made glucose by treating rags with sulphuric</seg><seg type="columnLine">acid. A man of good standing was this William T.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forbes, the father of two charming girls--Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorothy, called Doll, and Miss Martha, called Mat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who gave the tone to the best society in Philadelphia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It followed, then, on the proposition of Jem Chip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">supported by William T. Forbes and others, that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was decided to elect the president "on the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">point."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This mode of election can be applied in all cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it is desired to elect the most worthy; and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of Americans of high intelligence are already</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of employing it in the nomination of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">President of the Republic of the United States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On two boards of perfect whiteness a black line is</seg><seg type="columnLine">traced. The length of each of these lines is mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matically the same, for they have been determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">with as much accuracy as the base of the first tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle in a trigonometrical survey. That done, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two boards were erected on the same day in the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of the conference room, and the two candidates,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each armed with a fine needle, marched towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">board that had fallen to his lot. The man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted his needle nearest the center of his line would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be proclaimed President of the Weldon Institute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The operation must be done at once--no guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks or trial shots allowed; nothing but sureness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of eye. The man must have a compass in his eye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the saying goes; that was all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncle Prudent stuck in his needle at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment as Phil Evans did his. Then there began the</seg><seg type="columnLine">measurement to discover which of the two competi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors had almost nearly approached the center.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wonderful! Such had been the precision of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots that the measures gave no appreciable differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence.

Truck Milnor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted that the measurements should be remade by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of a rule graduated by the micrometrical ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine of M. Perreaux, which can divide a millimeter</seg><seg type="columnLine">into fifteen hundred parts. This rule, dividing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen-hundredths of a millimeter with a diamond</seg><seg type="columnLine">splinter, was brought to bear on the lines, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading the divisions through a microscope the fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing were the results: Uncle Prudent had ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the center within less than six fifteen-hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dredths of a millimeter.

A difference of three fifteen-hundredths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a millimeter! And on account of it Phil Evans</seg><seg type="columnLine">vowed against Uncle Prudent one of those hatreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">which are none the less fierce for being latent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ROBUR THE CONQUEROR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">831</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Visitor is Announced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE many experiments made during this last</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter of the nineteenth century have given</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable impetus to the question of dirigi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble balloons. The cars furnished with propellers</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached in 1852 to the aerostats of the elongated</seg><seg type="columnLine">form introduced by Henry Giffard, the machines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dupuy de Lome in 1872, of the Tissandier brothers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in 1883, and of Captains Krebs and Renard in 1884,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yielded many important results. But if these ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines, moving in a medium heavier than themselves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuvering under the propulsion of a screw, work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at an angle to the direction of the wind, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wind, to return to their point of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parture, had been really "dirigible," they had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded under very favorable conditions. In large</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered halls their success was perfect. In a calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere they did very well. In a light wind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">five or six yards a second they still moved. But noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing practical had been obtained. Against a miller's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind--nine yards a second--the machines had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained almost stationary. Against a fresh breeze--</seg><seg type="columnLine">eleven yards a second--they would have advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">backwards. In a storm--twenty-seven to thirty-three</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards a second--they would have been blown about</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a feather. In a hurricane--sixty yards a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">--they would have run the risk of being dashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces. And in one of those cyclones which exceed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred yards a second not a fragment of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been left. It remained, then, even after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the striking experiments of Captains Krebs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Renard, that though dirigible aerostats had gained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little speed, they could not be kept going in a moder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate breeze. Hence the impossibility of making prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical use of this mode of aerial locomotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With regard to the means employed to give the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aerostat its motion a great deal of progress had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. For the steam engines of Henry GifTard, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muscular force of Dupuy de Lome, electric mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors had gradually been substituted. The batteries</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bichromate of potassium of the Tissandier broth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers had given a speed of four yards a second. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamo-electric machines of Captains Krebs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Renard had developed a force of twelve horsepower</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yielded a speed of six and a half yards per sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With regard to this motor, engineers and elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricians had been approaching more and more to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">desideratum which is known as a steam horse in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch case. Gradually the results of the battery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Captains Krebs and Renard had kept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret had been surpassed, and aeronauts had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to avail themselves of motors whose lightness</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased at the same time as their power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this there was much to encourage those who be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved in the utilization of dirigible balloons. But yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">how many good people there ere who refuse to ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit the possibility of such a thing! If the aerostat</seg><seg type="columnLine">finds support in the air it belongs to the medium in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it moves; under such conditions, how can its</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, which offers so much resistance to the currents</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the atmosphere, make its way against the wind ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this struggle of the inventors after a light and</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful motor, the Americans had most nearly at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained what they sought. A dynamo-electric appara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tus, in which a new battery was employed, the com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">position of which was still a mystery, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought from its inventor, a Boston chemist up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">then unknown. Calculations made with the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">care, diagrams drawn with the utmost exactitude,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that by means of this apparatus driving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">screw of given dimensions a displacement could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained of from twenty to twenty-two yards a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now this was magnificent!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And it is not dear," said Uncle Prudent, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed to the inventor in return for his formal re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceipt the last instalment of the hundred thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper dollars he had paid for his invention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately the Weldon Institute set to work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When there comes along a project of practical utility</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money leaps nimbly enough from American</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets. The funds flowed in even without its being</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to form a syndicate. Three hundred thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand dollars came into the club's account at the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeal. The work began under the superintendence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the most celebrated aeronaut of the United States,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry W. Tinder, immortalized by three of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascents out of a thousand, one in which he rose to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of twelve thousand yards, higher than Gay</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lussac, Coxwell, Sivet, Croce-Spinelli, Tissandier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glaisher; another in which he had crossed America</seg><seg type="columnLine">from New York to San Francisco, exceeding by</seg><seg type="columnLine">many hundred leagues the journeys of Nadar, Go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dard, and others, to say nothing of that of John Wise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who accomplished eleven hundred and fifty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">from St. Louis to Jefferson county; the third, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended in a frightful fall from fifteen hundred feet at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cost of a slight sprain in the right thumb, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the less fortunate Pilatre de Rozier fell only seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet, and yet killed himself on the spot!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the time this story Wins the Weldon Institute</seg><seg type="columnLine">had got their work well in hand. In the Turner yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Philadelphia there reposed an enormous aerostat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose strength had been tried by highly compressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. It well merited the name of the monster balloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How large was Nadar's Geant? Six thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">cubic meters. How large was John Wise's balloon?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twenty thousand cubic meteis. How large was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Giffard balloon at the 1878 Exhibition? Twenty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand cubic meters. Compare these three aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stats with the aerial machine of the Weldon Institute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose volume amounted to forty thousand cubic</seg><seg type="columnLine">meters, and you will understand why Uncle Prudent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his colleagues were so justifiably proud of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This balloon not being destined for the exploration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the higher strata of the atmosphere, was not called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Excelsior, a name which is rather too much held</seg><seg type="columnLine">in honor among the citizens of America. No! It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">called simply, the Go-ahead, and all it had to do was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to justify its name by going ahead obediently to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wishes of its commander.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dynamo-electric machine, made according to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the patent purchased by the Weldon Institute, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly ready. In less than six weeks the Go-ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">would start for its first cruise through space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, as we have seen, all the mechanical difficulties</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not been overcome. Many evenings had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted to discussing, not the form of its screw nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">its dimensions, but whether it ought to be put behind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Tissandier brothers had done, or before as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captains Krebs and Renard had done. It is un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to add that the partisans of the two sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tems had almost come to blows. The group of "Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forists" were equaled in number by the group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">832</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Behindists." Uncle Prudent, who ought to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">given the casting vote--Uncle Prudent, brought up</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtless in the school of Professor Buridan--could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not bring himself to decide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Hence the impossibility of getting the screw into</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. The dispute might last for some time, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">the government interfered. But in the United States</seg><seg type="columnLine">the government meddles with private affairs as little</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it possibly can. And it is right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Things were in this state at this meeting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">13th of June, which threatened to end in a riot--in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults exchanged, fisticuffs succeeding the insults, cane</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrashings succeeding the fisticuffs, revolver shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeding the cane thrashings--when at thirty-seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes past eight there occurred a diversion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The porter of the Weldon Institute coolly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly, like a policeman amid the storm of the meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, approached the presidential desk. On it he</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed a card. He awaited the orders that Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prudent found it convenient to give.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Uncle Prudent turned on the steam whistle, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">did duty for the presidential bell, for even the Krem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin clock would have struck in vain! But the tumult</seg><seg type="columnLine">slackened not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the president removed his hat. Thanks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this extreme measure a semi-silence was obtained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A communication!" said Uncle Prudent, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking a huge pinch from the snuff-box which never</seg><seg type="columnLine">left him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Speak up!" answered eighty-nine voices, acci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dentally in agreement on this one point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A stranger, my dear colleagues, asks to be ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted to the meeting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Never!" replied every voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He desires to prove to us, it would appear," con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued Uncle Prudent, "'hat to believe in guiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">balloons is to believe in'^e absurdest of Utopias!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Let him in !

Robur! Robur!" yelled the assembly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the welcome accorded so quickly to the curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">name was chiefly due to the Weldon Institute hoping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to vent its exasperation on the head of him who bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">In Which a New Character Appears</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TIZENS of the United States!

I am</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  V--^ forty years old, although I look but thirty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I have a constitution of iron, a healthy vigor that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing can shake, a muscular strength that few can</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal, and a digestion that would be thought first</seg><seg type="columnLine">class even in an ostrich!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were listening! Yes! The riot was quelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once by the totally unexpected fashion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech. Was this fellow a madman or a hoaxer?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whoever he was, he kept his audience in hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was not a whisper in the meeting in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a few minutes ago the storm was in full fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Robur looked the man he said he was. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle height and geometric breadth, his figure was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a regular trapezoid with the greatest of its parallel</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides formed by the line of his shoulders. On this</seg><seg type="columnLine">line attached by a robust neck there rose an enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheroidal head. The head of what animal did it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">resemble from the point of view of passional anal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ogy? The head of a bull; but a bull with an intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent face. Eyes which at the least opposition would</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow like coals of fire; and above them a permanent</seg><seg type="columnLine">contraction of the superciliary muscle, an invariable</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of extreme energy. Short hair, slightly woolly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with metallic reflections; large chest rising and fall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like a smith's bellows; arms, hands, legs, feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all worthy of the trunk. No mustaches, no whiskers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a large American goatee, revealing the attach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of the jaw whose masseter muscles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently of formidable strength. It has been cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culated--what has not been calculated?--that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure of the jaw of an ordinary crocodile can</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach four hundred atmospheres, while that of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hound can only amount to one hundred. From this</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following curious formula has been deduced:--</seg><seg type="columnLine">If a kilogram o.f dog produces eight kilograms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">masseteric force, a kilogram of crocodile could pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce twelve. Now, a kilogram of the aforesaid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Robur would not produce less than ten, so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came between the dog and the crocodile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From what country did this remarkable specimen</seg><seg type="columnLine">come ? It was difficult to say. One thing was notice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, and that was that he expressed himself fluently</seg><seg type="columnLine">in English without a trace of the drawling twang</seg><seg type="columnLine">that distinguishes the Yankees of New England.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He continued: "And now, honorable citizens, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mental faculties. You see before you an engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose nerves are in no way inferior to his muscles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have no fear of anything or anybody. I have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of will that has never had to yield. When</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	have decided on a thing, all America, all the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">may strive in vain to keep me from it. When I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">an idea I allow no one to share it, and I do not per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit any contradiction. I insist on these details,</seg><seg type="columnLine">honorable citizens, because it is necessary you should</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite understand me. Perhaps you think I am talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing too much about myself? It does not matter if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do! And now consider a little before you inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupt me, as I have come to tell you something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you may not be particularly pleased to hear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sound as of the surf on the beach began to rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the first row of seats--a sign that the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be long in getting stormy again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Speak, stranger!" said Uncle Prudent, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">some difficulty in restraining himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Robur spoke as follows, without troubling</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself any more about his audience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes! I know it well! After a century of experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments that have led to nothing, and trials giving no</seg><seg type="columnLine">result, there still exist ill-balanced minds who believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">in dirigible balloons. They imagine that a motor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort, electric or otherwise, might be applied</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their pretentious skin bags which are at the mercy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of every current in the atmosphere. They persuade</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves that they can be masters of an aerostat</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they can be masters of a ship on the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea. Because a few inventors in calm or nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm weather have succeeded in working on an angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the wind, or even going to windward in a gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze, they think that the steering of aerial appa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratus lighter than the air is a practicable matter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, now, look here: You hundred, who believe in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the realization of your dreams, are throwing your</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of dollars not into water but into space!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You are fighting the impossible!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strange it was that at this affirmation the mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers of the Weldon Institute did not move.

A balloon! When</seg><seg type="columnLine">to obtain the raising of a couple of pounds you</seg><seg type="columnLine">require a cubic yard of gas. A balloon pretending</seg><seg type="columnLine">to resist the wind by aid of its mechanism, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pressure of a light breeze on a vessel's sails is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not less than that of four hundred horsepower; when</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the accident at the Tay Bridge you saw the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce a pressure of eight and a half hundredweight</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a square yard. A balloon, when on such a sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem nature has never constructed anything flying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether furnished with wings like birds, or mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">branes like certain fish, or certain mammalia-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mammalia?" exclaimed one of the members.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes! Mammalia! The bat, which flies, if I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">not mistaken! Is the gentleman unaware that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier is a mammal? Did he ever see an omelette</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of bat's eggs?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The interrupter reserved himself for future inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruption, and Robur resumed: "But does that mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">that man is to give up the conquest of the air, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the transformation of the domestic and political</seg><seg type="columnLine">manners of the old world, by the use of this admir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able means of locomotion? By no means. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has become master of the seas with the ship, by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oar, the sail, the wheel, and the screw, so shall he</seg><seg type="columnLine">become master of atmospherical space by apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavier than the air--for it must be heavier to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger than the air!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then the assembly exploded. What a broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of yells escaped from all these mouths, aimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Robur like the muzzles of so many guns! Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not this hurling a declaration of war into the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp of the balloonists? Was not this a stirring up</seg><seg type="columnLine">of strife between "the lighter" and "the heavier"</seg><seg type="columnLine">than air?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Robur did not even frown.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in conclusion these are the words he hurled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces of the balloonists: "With your balloons you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can do nothing--you will arrive at nothing--you</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare do nothing! The boldest of your aeronauts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Wise, although he has made an aerial voyage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twelve hundred miles above the American conti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent, has had to give up his project of crossing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantic!

Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral times had the inhabitants complained of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisy way in which the proceedings ended, and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than once had the policemen had to interfere to clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thoroughfare for the passersby, who for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most part were supremely indifferent on this question</seg><seg type="columnLine">of aerial navigation. But never before had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumult attained such proportions, never had the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaints been better founded, never had the interven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the police been more necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was some excuse for the members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Weldon Institute. They had been attacked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own house. To these enthusiasts for "lighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">than air" a no less enthusiast for "heavier than air"</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said things absolutely abhorrent. And at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment they were about to treat him as he deserved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So they cried aloud for vengeance. To leave such</seg><seg type="columnLine">insults unpunished was impossible to all with Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can blood in their veins. Had not the sons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amerigo been called the sons of Cabot? Was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">that an insult as unpardonable as it happened to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">just--historically?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The members of the club in several groups rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down Walnut Street, then into the adjoining streets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ROBUR THE CONQUEROR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">835</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and then all over the neighborhood. They woke</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the householders; they compelled them to search</seg><seg type="columnLine">their houses, prepared to indemnify them later on</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the outrage on their privacy. Vain were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">their trouble and searching. Robur was nowhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be found; there was no trace of him. He might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone off in the Go-ahead, the balloon of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Institute, for all they could tell. After an hour's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunt the members had to give in and separate, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they had agreed to extend their search over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole territory of the twin Americas that form</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new continent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By eleven o'clock quiet had been restored in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighborhood of Walnut Street. Philadelphia was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to sink again into that sound sleep which is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">privilege of non-manufacturing towns. The different</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the club parted to seek their respective</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses. To mention the most distinguished amongst</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, William T. Forbes sought his large sugar</seg><seg type="columnLine">establishment, where Miss Doll and Miss Mat had</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared for him his evening tea, sweetened with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own glucose. Truck Milnor took the road to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his factory in the distant suburb, where the engines</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked day and night. Treasurer Jem Chip, publicly</seg><seg type="columnLine">accused of possessing an alimentary canal twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches longer than that of other men, returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vegetable soup that was waiting for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two of the most important balloonists--two only</seg><seg type="columnLine">--did not seem to think of returning so soon to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">domicile. They availed themselves of the oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to discuss the question with more than usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">acrimony. These were the irreconcilables, Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prudent and Phil Evans, the president and secre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary of the Weldon Institute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the door of the club the valet Frycollin waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Uncle Prudent, his master, and at last he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him, though he caj-ed but little for the subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had set the two colleagues at loggerheads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is only by an euphemism that the verb "discuss"</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be used to express the way in which the duet</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the president and secretary was being per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed. As a matter of fact they were in full</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrangle with an energy born of their old rivalry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir, no," said Phil Evans. "If I had had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor of being president of the Weldon Institute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there never, no, never, would have been such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scandal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what would you have done, if you,had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the honor?" demanded Uncle Prudent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I would have stopped the insulter before he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his mouth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems to me it would have been impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop him until he had opened his mouth," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Prudent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not in America, sir; not in America."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND exchanging such observations, increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in bitterness as they went, they walked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the streets farther and farther from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes, until they reached a part of the city whence</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had to go a long way round to get back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frycollin followed, by no means at ease to see his</seg><seg type="columnLine">master plunging into such deserted spots. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not like deserted spots, particularly after midnight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact the darkness was profound and the moon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a thin crescent just beginning its monthly life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frycollin kept a lookout to the left and right of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see if he was followed. And he fancied he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see five or six hulking fellows dogging his footsteps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Instinctively he drew nearer to his master, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the world would he have dared to break in on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conversation of which the fragments reached him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In short it so chanced that the president and sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">retary of the Weldon Institute found themselves on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road to Fairmount Park. In the full heat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their dispute they crossed the Schuylkill River by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the famous iron bridge. They met only a few belated</seg><seg type="columnLine">wayfarers, and pressed on across a wide open tract</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the immense prairie was broken every now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then by the patches of thick woodland which</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the park different from any other in the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There Frycollin's terror became acute, particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he saw the five or six shadows gliding after him</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the Schuylkill bridge. The pupils of his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadened out to the circumference of his iris, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his limbs seemed to diminish as if endowed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contractility peculiar to the mollusca and certain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the articulata; for Frycollin, the valet, was an egre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gious coward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a pure South Carolina negro, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of a fool and the carcass of an imbecile. Being</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one and twenty, he had never been a slave, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even by birth, but that made no difference to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grinning and greedy and idle, and a magnificent</seg><seg type="columnLine">poltroon, he had been the servant of Uncle Prudent</seg><seg type="columnLine">for about three years. Over and over again had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">master threatened to kick him out, but had kept him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on for fear of doing worse. With a master ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to venture on the most audacious enterprises,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frycollin's cowardice had brought him many arduous</seg><seg type="columnLine">trials. But he had some compensation. Very little</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been said about his gluttony, and still less about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his laziness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ah, Valet Frycollin, if you could only have read</seg><seg type="columnLine">the future! Why, oh v'ly, Frycollin, did you not</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain at Boston with ^e Sneffels, and not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">given them up when they talked of going to Switzer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land ? Was not that a much more suitable place for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you than this of Uncle Prudent's, where danger was</seg><seg type="columnLine">daily welcomed ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But here he was, and his master had become used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his faults. He had one advantage, and that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a consideration. Although he was a negro by birth</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not speak like a negro, and nothing is so irri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tating as that hateful jargon in which all the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouns are objective and all the verbs infinitive. Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">it be understood, also that Frycollin was a thorough</seg><seg type="columnLine">coward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now it was midnight, and the pale crescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the moon began to sink in the west behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees in the park. The rays streaming fitfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the branches made the shadows darker than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. Frycollin looked around him anxiously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Brrr!" he said, "there are those fellows there'all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time. Positively they are getting nearer! Master</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle!" he shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was thus he called the president of the Weldon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Institute, and thus did the president desire to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the moment the dispute of the rivals had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached its maximum, and as they hurled their epi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thets at each other they walked faster and faster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew farther and farther away from the Schuyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill bridge. They had reached the center of a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">clump of trees, whose summits were just tipped by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parting rays of the moon. Beyond the trees was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very large clearing--an ov?l field, a complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">amphitheater. Not a hillock was there to hinder the</seg><seg type="columnLine">836</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gallop of the horses, not a bush to stop the view of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spectators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And if Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so deep in their dispute, and had used their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes as they were accustomed to, they would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the clearing was not in its usual state. Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a flour mill that had anchored on it during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night? It looked like it, with its wings and sails--</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless and mysterious in the gathering gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But neither the president nor the secretary of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weldon Institute noticed the strange modification in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landscape of Fairmount Park; and neither did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frycollin. It seemed to him that the thieves were</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching, and preparing for their attack; and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seized with convulsive fear, paralyzed in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs, with every hair he could boast of on the bristle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His terror was extreme. His knees bent under him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he had just strength enough to exclaim for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last time, "Master Uncle! Master Uncle!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the matter with you ?" asked Uncle Pru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent. Perhaps the disputants would not have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry to have relieved their fury at the expense of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfortunate valet. But they had no time; and neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">even had he time to answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A whistle was heard. A flash of electric light shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A signal, doubtless? The moment had come for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deed of violence! In less time than it takes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell, six men came leaping across from under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, two upon Uncle Prudent, two upon Phil Evans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two upon Frycollin--there was no need for the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">last, for the negro was incapable of defending him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. The president and secretary of the Weldon In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitute, although taken by surprise, would have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had neither time ror strength to do so. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second they were rendered speechless by a gag,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind by a bandage, thrcrtvn down, pinioned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried bodily off across the clearing. What could</seg><seg type="columnLine">they think except that they had fallen into the hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of people who intended to rob them ? The people did</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of the sort, however. They did not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch Uncle Prudent's pockets, although, according</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his custom, they were full of paper dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within a minute of the attack, without a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">being passed, Uncle Prudent, Phil Evans, and Fry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">collin felt themselves laid gently down, not on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass, but on a sort of plank that creaked beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They were laid down side by side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A door was shut; and the grating of a bolt in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">staple told them that they were prisoners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there came a continuous buzzing, a quivering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a frrrr with the rrr unending.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that was the only sound that broke the quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Great was the excitement next morning in Phila-</seg><seg type="columnLine">delphia! Very early was it known what had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the meeting of the Institute. Everyone knew of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the appearance of the mysterious engineer named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Robur -- Robur the Conqueror -- and the tumult</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the balloonists, and his inexplicable disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was quite another thing when all the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard that the president and secretary of the club</seg><seg type="columnLine">had also disappeared during the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long and keen was the search in the city and</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighborhood ! Useless! The newspapers of Phila-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">delphia, the newspapers of Pennsylvania, the news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers of the United States reported the facts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained them in a hundred ways, not one of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the right one. Heavy rewards were offered, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">placards were pasted up, but all to no purpose. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth seemed to have opened and bodily swallowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the president and secretary of the Weldon Institute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The President and Secretary Suspend Hostilities</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A BANDAGE over the eyes, a gag in the mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cord round the wrists, a cord round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankles, ur&gt;able to see, to speak, or to move,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Prudent, Phil Evans, and Frycollin were any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing but pleased with their position. Knowing not</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had seized them, nor into what they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown like parcels in a goods wagon, nor where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were, nor what was reserved for them--it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to exasperate even the most patient of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ovine race, and we know that the members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weldon Institute were not precisely sheep as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience went. With his violence of character we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily imagine how Uncle Prudent felt. One thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was evident, that Phil Evans and he would find it</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult to attend the club next evening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to Frycollin, with his eyes shut and his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, it was impossible for him to think of any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. He was more dead than alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an hour the position of the prisoners remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">unchanged. No one came to visit them, or to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">them that liberty of movement and speech of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they lay in such need. They were reduced to stifled</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighs, to grunts emitted over and under their gags,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to everything that betrayed anger kept dumb and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury imprisoned, or rather bound down. Then after</seg><seg type="columnLine">many fruitless efforts they remained for some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though lifeless. Then as the sense of sight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">denied them they tried by their sense of hearing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtain some indication of the nature of this disquiet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing state of things. But in vain did they seek for</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other sound than an interminable and inexplic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able f-r-r-r which seemed to envelope them in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivering atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last something happened. Phil Evans, regain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his coolness, managed to slacken the cord which</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound his wrists. Little by little the knot slipped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers slipped over each other, and his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">regained their usual freedom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A vigorous rubbing restored the circulation. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment after he had slipped off the bandage which</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound his eyes_, taken the gag out of his mouth, and.</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut the cords round his ankles with his knife. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">American who has not a bowie-knife in his pocket is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer an American.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if Phil Evans had regained the power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving and speaking, that was all. His eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless to him--at present at any rate. The prison</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite dark, though about six feet above him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble gleam of light came in through a kind of loop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As may be imagined, Phil Evans did not hesitate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to at once set free his rival. A few cuts with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowie settled the knots which bound him foot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately Uncle Prudent rose to his knees and</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched away his bandage and his gag.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks," said he. in a stifled voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ROBUR THE CONQUEROR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">837</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No!" said the other, "no thanks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Phil Evans?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Uncle Prudent?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Here we are no longer the president and secretary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Weldon Institute.

"We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">must set him free."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Not yet," said Uncle Prudent. "He would over-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whelm us with his jeremiads, and we have something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">else to do than abuse each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What is that, Uncle Prudent?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"To save ourselves if possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And even if it is impossible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You are right; even if it is impossible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There could be no doubt that this kidnapping was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">due to Robur, for an ordinary thief would have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">relieved them of their watches, jewelry, and purses,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and thrown their bodies in the Schuylkill with a good</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gash in their throats instead of throwing them to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bottom of- Of what? That was a serious ques-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion, which would have to be answered before at-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tempting an escape with any chance of success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Phil Evans," began Uncle Prudent, "if, when we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came away from our meeting, instead of indulging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in amenities to which we need not recur, we had kept</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">our eyes more open, this would not have happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Had we remained in the streets of Philadelphia there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would have been none of this. Evidently Robur</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">foresaw what would happen at the club, and had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">placed some of his bandits on guard at the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When we left Walnut Street these fellows must have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">watched us and followed us, and when we impru-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dently ventured into Fairmount Park they, went in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for their little game."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Agreed," said Evans. "We were wrong not to go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">straight home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It is always wrong not to be right," said Prudent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Here a long-drawn sigh escaped from the darkest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">corner of the prison.

"Now to work." And then the two men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their hands stretched out and their fingers wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart, began to feel round the walls to find a joint</seg><seg type="columnLine">or crack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing. Nothing; not even at the door. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely shut and it was impossible to shoot back the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock. All that could be done was to make a hole, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape through the hole. It remained to be seen if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knives could cut into the walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But whence comes this never-ending rustling?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Evans, who was much impressed at the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuous f-r-r-r.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The wind, doubtless," said Uncle Prudent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I he wind! But I thought the night was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So it was. But if it isn't the wind, what can it</seg><seg type="columnLine">be?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Phil Evans got out the best blade of his knife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set to work on the wall near the door. Perhaps he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might make a hole which would enable him to open</seg><seg type="columnLine">it from the outside should it be only bolted or should</seg><seg type="columnLine">the key have been left in the lock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He worked away for some minutes. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">result was to nip up his knife, to snip off its point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and transform what was left of the blade into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doesn't it cut ?" asked Uncle Prudent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is the wall made of sheet iron?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No ; it gives no metallic sound when you hit it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it of ironwood?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No; it isn't iron and it isn't wood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Impossible to say.

You have a try."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Prudent had a try, but the knife could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do nothing against a wall which its best blades could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even scratch. The wall seemed to be made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it became evident that all flight was imprac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticable except through the door, and for a time they</seg><seg type="columnLine">must resign themselves to their fate--not a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant thing for the Yankee temperament, and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to the disgust of these eminently practical men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this conclusion was not arrived at without many</seg><seg type="columnLine">objurgations and loud-sounding phrases hurled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this Robur--who, from what had been seen of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Weldon Institute, was not the sort of man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble himself much about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Frycollin began to give unequivocal signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being unwell. He began to writhe in a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamentable fashion, either with cramp in his stomach</seg><seg type="columnLine">or in his limbs; and Uncle Prudent, thinking it his</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty to put an end to these gymnastics, cut the cords</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bound him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had cause to be sorry for it. Immediately there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was poured forth an interminable litany, in which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrors of fear were mingled with the tortures of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger.

The first inventors did not think of apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighter than air; for that the science of their time</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not allow them to imagine. It was to contrivances</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavier than air, to flying machines in imitation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the birds, that they trusted to realize aerial locomo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was exactly what had been done by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">madman Icarus, the son of Dcedalus, whose wings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed together with wax, had melted as they ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But without going back to mythological times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without dwelling on Archytas of Tarentum, we find</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the works of Dante of Perugia, of Leonardo da</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vinci and Guidotti, the idea of machines made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move through the air. Two centuries and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterwards inventors began to multiply. In 1742</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Marquis de Bacqueville designed a system of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings, tried it over the Seine, and fell and broke his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. In 1768 Paucton conceived the idea of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus with two screws, suspensive and propul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive. In 1781 Meerwein, the architect of the Prince</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Baden, built an orthopteric machine, and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested against the tendency of the aerostats which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just been invented. In 1784 Launoy and Bien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venu had maneuvered a helicopter worked by springs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In 1808 there were the attempts at flight by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Austrian Jacques Degen. In 1810 came the pamphlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Deniau of Nantes, in which the principles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"heavier than air" are laid down. From 1811 to 1840</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the inventions and researches of Derblinger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vigual, Sarti. Dubochet, and Cagniard de Latour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In 1842 we have the Englishman Henson, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">system of inclined planes and screws worked by</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam. In 1845 came Cossus and his ascensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">screws. In 1847 came Camille Vert and his helicop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter made of birds' wings. In 1852 came Letur with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his system of guidable parachutes, whose trial cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">him his life; and in the same year came Michael</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loup with his plan of gliding through the air on</seg><seg type="columnLine">four revolving wings. In 1853 came Beleguic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his aeroplane with the traction screws, Vaussin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chardannes with his guidable kite, and George</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cauley with his flying-machines driven by gas. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">1854 to 1863 appeared Joseph Pline with several</seg><seg type="columnLine">patents for aerial systems. Breant, Carlingford, Le</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bris. Du Temple. Bright, whose ascensional screws</seg><seg type="columnLine">were left-handed: Smythies, Panafieu, Crosnier, etc.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At length, in 1863, thanks to the efforts of Nadar, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">society of "heavier than air" was founded in Paris.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There the inventors could experiment with the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines, of which many were patented.

The impetus was given,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventors invented, calculators calculated all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could render aerial locomotion practicable.

Without these at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempts, these experiments of his predecessors, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">could the inquirer have conceived so perfect an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus? And though he had but contempt for</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who obstinately worked away in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of balloons, he held in high esteem all those partisans</seg><seg type="columnLine">of "heavier than air," English, American, Italian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Austrian, French--and particularly French-- whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">work had been perfected by him, and led him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">design and then to build this flying machine known as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Albatross, which he was guiding through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">currents of the atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The pigeon flies!" had exclaimed one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most persistent adepts at aviation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They will crowd the air as they crowd the earth!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said one of his most excited partisans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From the locomotive to the aeromotive!" shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noisiest of all, who hadnurned on the trumpet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">publicity to awaken the Olu-and New Worlds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Nothing, in fact, is better established, by experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and calculation, than that the air is highly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistant. A circumference of only a yard in diameter</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shape of a parachute can not only impede</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent in air, but can render it isochronous. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is equally well known that when the speed is</seg><seg type="columnLine">great the work of the weight varies in almost inverse</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratio to the square of the speed, and therefore be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes almost insignificant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is also known that as the weight of a flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal increases, the less is the proportional increase</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the surface beaten by the wings in order to sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain it, although the motion of the wings becomes</seg><seg type="columnLine">slower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A flying machine must therefore be constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take advantage of these natural laws, to imitate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bird, "that admirable type of aerial locomotion,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to Dr. Marcy, of the Institute of France.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In short, the contrivances likely to solve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem are of three kinds:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1.	Helicopters or spiral if ers, which are simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">screws with vertical axes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 2.	Orthopters, machines which endeavour to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce the natural flight of birds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 3.	Aeroplanes, which are merely inclined planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">like kites, but towed or driven by screws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each of these systems has had and still has its</seg><seg type="columnLine">partisans obstinately resolved not to give way in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest particular.</seg><seg type="columnLine">840</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HOWEVER, Robur, for many reasons, had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected the two first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The orthopter, or mechanical bird, offers certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantages, no doubt. That the work and experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of M. Renard in 1884 have sufficiently proved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, as has been said, it is not necessary to copy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nature servilely. Locomotives are not copied from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hare, nor are ships copied from the fish. To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first we have put wheels which are not legs; to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second we have put screws which are not fins. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">they do not do so badly. Besides what is this me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanical movement in the flight of birds, whose action</seg><seg type="columnLine">is so complex? Has not Doctor Marcy suspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the feathers open during the return of the wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">so as to let the air through them? And is not that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather a difficult operation for an artificial machine?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other hand, aeroplanes have given many</seg><seg type="columnLine">good results. Screws opposing a slanting plane to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bed of air will produce an ascensional movement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the models experimented on have shown that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disposable weight, that is to say the weight it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to deal with as distinct from that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus, increases with the square of the speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herein the aeroplane has the advantage over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aerostat even when the aerostat is furnished with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of locomotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless Robur had thought that the simpler</seg><seg type="columnLine">his contrivance the belter. And the screws--the Saint</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helices that had been thrown in his teeth at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weldon Institute--had sufficed for all the needs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his flying machine. One series could hold it sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended in the air, the other could drive it along under</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions that were marvelously adapted for speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the orthopter--striking like the wings of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird--raised itself by beating the air, the helicopter</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised itself by striking"the air obliquely with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fins of the screw as it mounted on an inclined plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These fins, or arms, are in reality wings, but wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposed as a helix instead of as a paddle wheel. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">helix advances in the direction of its axis. Is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">axis vertical? Then it moves vertically. Is the axis</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizontal ? Then it moves horizontally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole of Robur's flying apparatus depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">on these two movements, as will be seen from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following detailed description, which can be divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">under three heads--the platform, the engines of sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pension and propulsion, and the machinery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Platform--This was a framework a hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and twelve wide, a ship's deck in fact, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">projecting prow. Beneath was a hull solidly built,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosing the engines, stores, and provisions of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorts, including the water tanks. Round the deck a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few light uprights supported a wire trellis that did</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty for bulwarks. On the deck were three houses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose compartments were used as cabins for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew, or as machine-rooms. In the center house was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine which drove the lifting helices, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that forward was the machine that drove the bow</seg><seg type="columnLine">screw, in that aft was the machine that drove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern screw. In the bow were the cook's galley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew's quarters; in the stern were several cabins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">including that of the engineer, the saloon, and above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them all a glass house in which stood the helmsman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who steered the vessel by means of a powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudder. All these cabins were lighted by port-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes filled with toughened glass, which has ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">times the resistance of ordinary glass. Beneath this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hull was a system of flexible springs to ease off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the concussion when it became advisable to land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Engines of suspension and propulsion.--Above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck rose thirty-seven vertical axes, fifteen along</seg><seg type="columnLine">each side, and seven, more elevated in the centre.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Albatross might be called a clipper with thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven masts. But these masts instead of sails bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">each two horizontal screws, not very large in spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">or diameter, but driven at prodigious speed. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these axes had its movement independent of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest, and each alternate one spun round in a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction from the others,-so as to avoid any tendency</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gyration. Hence the screws as they rose on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertical column of air retained their equilibrium by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their horizontal resistance. Consequently the appara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tus was furnished with seventy-four lifting screws</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose three wings were connected by a metallic circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">which economized their motive force. In front and</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, mounted on horizontal axes, were two pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelling screws, each with four arms. These screws</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of much larger diameter than the lifting ones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but could be worked at quite their speed. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel combined the system of Cossus, La Lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">delle, and Ponton d'Amecourt, as perfected by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Robur. But it was in the choice and application of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his motive force that he could claim to be an inventor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Machinery.--Robur had not availed himself of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor of water or other liquids, nor compressed air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other elastic gases, nor explosive mixtures cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able of producing mechanical motion. He employed</seg><seg type="columnLine">electricity, that agent which one day will be the soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the industrial world. But he required no electro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">generator to produce it. All he trusted to were bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teries and accumulators. What were the elements of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these batteries, and what were the acids he used,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Robur only knew. And the construction of the accu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mulators was kept equally secret. Of what were their</seg><seg type="columnLine">positive and negative plates ? None could say. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer took good care--and not unreasonably--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep his secret unpatented. One thing was unmistak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, and that was that the batteries were of extraor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary strength; and the accumulators left those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Faure-Sellon-Volckmar very far behind in yielding</seg><seg type="columnLine">currents whase amperes ran into figures up to then</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown. Thus there was obtained a power to drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screws and communicate a suspending and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelling force in excess of all his requirements under</seg><seg type="columnLine">any circumstances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But--it is as well to repeat it--this belonged en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely to Robur. He kept it a close secret. And, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the president and secretary of the Weldon Institute</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not happen to discover it, it would probably be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost to humanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It need not be shown that the apparatus possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient stability. Its center of gravity proved that</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once. There was no danger of its making alarm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing angles with the horizontal, still less of its cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sizing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now for the metal used by Robur in the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction of his aeronef--a name which can be exact-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly applied to the Albatross. What was this material,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so hard that the bowie-knife of Phil Evans could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratch it, and Uncle Prudent could not explain its</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature ? Simply paper!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some years this fabrication had been making</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable progress. Unsized paper, with the sheets</seg><seg type="columnLine">impregnated with dextrin and starch and squeezed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydraulic presses, will form a material hard like steel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are made of it pulleys, rails, and wagon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels, much more solid than metal wheels, and far</seg><seg type="columnLine">ROBUR THE CONQUEROR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">841</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lighter. And it was this lightness and solidity which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Robur availed himself of in building his aerial loco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive. Everything--framework, hull, houses, cabins</seg><seg type="columnLine">--were made of straw paper turned hard as metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">by compression, and--what was not to be despised in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an apparatus flying at great heights--incombustible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The different parts of the engines and the screws</seg><seg type="columnLine">were made of gelatinized fiber, which combined in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient degree flexibility with resistance.

But Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are silent," continued the engineer. "Doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less hunger makes you dumb! But if I undertook to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry you through the air, I did not think of feed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing you on such a poorly nutritive fluid. Your first</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast is waiting for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans were feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pangs of hunger somewhat keenly they did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">care to stand upon ceremony. A meal would commit</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to nothing; and when Robur put them back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground they could resume full liberty of action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so they followed into a small dining-room in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aftermost house.

There were different preserves; and, among</seg><seg type="columnLine">other things, was a sort of bread made of equal parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flour and meat reduced to powder and worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">together with a little lard, which boiled in water</seg><seg type="columnLine">made excellent soup; and there were fried rashers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bacon; and for drink there was tea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither had Frycollin been forgotten. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken forward, and there found some strong soup</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of this bread. In truth he had to be very</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry to eat at all, for his jaws shook with fear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost refused to work. "If it was to break!--</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it was to break!" said the unfortunate negro.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hence continual faintings. Only think! A fall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">over four thousand feet, which would smash him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a jelly!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour afterwards Uncle Prudent and Phil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evans appeared on the deck. Robur was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. At the stern the man at the wheel in his glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">cage, his eyes fixed on the compass, followed im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perturbably without hesitation the route given by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for the rest of the crew, breakfast probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept them from their posts. An assistant engineer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">examining the machinery, went from one house to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the speed of the ship was great the two col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues could only estimate it imperfectly, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albatross had passed through the cloud zone which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun showed some four thousand feet below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can hardly believe it," said Phil Evans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't believe it!" said Uncle Prudent. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to the bow they looked out towards the western</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another town," said Phil Evans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you recognize it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes! It seems to me ter be Montreal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Montreal ? But we &lt;&gt;*ily left Quebec two hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That proves that we must be going at a speed of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy-five miles an hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such was the speed of the aeronef; and if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers were not inconvenienced by it, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">because they were going with the wind. In a calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">such speed would have been difficult and the rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have sunk to that of an express. In a head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind the speed would have been impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Phil Evans was not mistaken. Below the Albatross</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared Montreal, easily recognizable by the Vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toria Bridge, a tubular bridge thrown over the St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lawrence like the railway viaduct over the Venice</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagoon. Soon they could distinguish the town's wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets, its huge shops, its palatial banks, its cathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dral, recently built on the model of St. Peter's at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rome, and then Mount Royal, which commands the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city and forms a magnificent park.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Luckily Phil Evans had visited the chief towns of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canada, and could recognize them without asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Robur. After Montreal they passed Ottawa, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls, seen from above, looked like a vast cauldron in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ebullition, throwing off masses of steam with grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is the Parliament House."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he pointed out a sort of Nuremburg toy</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted on a hill top. This story with its polychrome</seg><seg type="columnLine">architecture resembled the House of Parliament in</seg><seg type="columnLine">London much as the Montreal cathedral resembles</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. Peter's at Rome. But that was of no conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quence ; there could be no doubt it was Ottawa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon the city faded off towards the horizon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed but a luminous spot on the ground</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was almost two hours before Robur appeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His mate, Tom Turner, accompanied him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">said only three words. These were transmitted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two assistant engineers in the fore and aft engine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses. At a sign the helmsman changed the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the Albatross a couple of points to the south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">west ; at the same time Uncle Prudent and Phil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evans felt that a greater speed had been given to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">propellers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In fact, the speed had been doubled, and now sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed anything that had ever been attained by ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">restrial engines. Torpedo boats do their twenty-two</seg><seg type="columnLine">knots an hour; railway trains do their sixty miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour; the ice boats on the frozen Hudson do their</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty-five miles an hour; a machine built by the Pat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terson company, with a cogged wheel, has done its</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighty miles; and another locomotive between Tren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton and Jersey City has done its eighty-four.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the Albatross, at full speed, could do her hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and twenty miles an hour, or 176 feet per</seg><seg type="columnLine">second. This speed is that of the storm which tears</seg><seg type="columnLine">up trees by the roots. It is the mean speed of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrier pigeon, and is only surpassed by the flight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swallow (220 feet per second), and that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift (274 feet per second).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a word, as Robur had said, the Albatross, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">using the whole force of her screws, could make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tour of the globe in two hundred hours, or less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Is it necessary to say so ? The phenomenon whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance had so much puzzled the people of both</seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds was the aeronef of the engineer. The trum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pet which blared its startling fanfares through the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that of the mate, Tom Turner. The flag planted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the chief monuments of Europe, Asia, America,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the flag of Robur the Conqueror and his Alba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And if up to then the engineer had taken many</seg><seg type="columnLine">precautions against being recognized, if by prefer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence he traveled at night, clearing the way with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric lights, and during the day vanishing into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">zones above the clouds, he seemed now to have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to keep his secret hidden. And if he had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Philadelphia and presented himself at the meeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Weldon Institute, was it not that they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">share in his prodigious discovery, and that he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">convince ipso facto the most incredulous? We know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he had been received, and we see what reprisals</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had taken on the president and secretary of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again did Robur approach his prisoners, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected to be in no way surprised at what they saw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what had succeeded in spite of them. Evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the cranium of these two Anglo-Saxon heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a thick crust of obstinacy, which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be easy to remove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On his part, Robur did not seem to notice anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular, and coolly continued the conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had begun two hours before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen." said he, "you ask yourselves doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less if this apparatus, so marvelously adapted for</seg><seg type="columnLine">aerial locomotion is susceptible to receiving greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. It is not worth while to conquer space if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">CBTmot derotrr it. I wanted the air to be a solid sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port to me, and it is. I saw that to struggle against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind I must be stronger than the wind, and I am.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ROBUR THE CONQUEROR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I had no need of sails to drive me. nor oars nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels to push me, nor rails to give me a faster road.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Air is what I ^wanted, that was all. Air surrounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as water surrounds the submarine boat, and in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">my propellers act like the screws of a steamer. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is how I solved the problem of aviation. That is what</seg><seg type="columnLine">a balloon will never do, nor will any machine that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighter than air."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Silence, absolute, on the part of the colleagues,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which did not (or a moment disconcert the engineer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He contented himself with a half-smile, and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued in his interrogative style, "Perhaps you ask if</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this power of the Albatross to move horizontally</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is added an equal power of vertical move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment--in a word, if, when we visit the higher zones</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the atmosphere, we can compete with an aerostat?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, I should not advise you to enter the Go-ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">against her!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The two colleagues shrugged their shoulders. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was probably what the engineer was waiting for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Robur made a sign. The propelling screws imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately stopped, and after running for a mile the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albatross pulled up motionless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a second gesture from Robur the ascensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">helices revolved at a speed that can only be compared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that of a siren in acoustical experiments. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">f-r-r-r-r rose nearly an octave in the scale of sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminishing gradually in intensity as the air became</seg><seg type="columnLine">more rarefied, and the machine rose vertically, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lark singing his song in space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Master! Master!" shouted Frycollin. "See that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it doesn't break!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A smile of disdain was Robur's only reply. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes the Albatross had attained the height of</seg><seg type="columnLine">8,700 feet, and extended the range of vision by sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enty miles, the barometer having fallen 480 milli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then the Albatross descended. The diminution of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pressure in high altitudes leads to the diminution</seg><seg type="columnLine">of oxygen in the air, and consequently in the blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This has been the cause of several serious accidents</seg><seg type="columnLine">which have happened to aeronauts, and Robur saw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">110	reason to run any risk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Albatross thus returned to the height she</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to prefer, and her propellers beginning again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove her off to the southwest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, sirs, if that is what you wanted you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then, leaning over the rail, he remained absorbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in contemplation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When he raised his head the president and secre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary of the Weldon Institute stood by his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Engineer Robur," said Uncle Prudent, in vain</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavoring to control himself, "we have nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask about what you seem to believe, but we wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask you a question which we think you would do</seg><seg type="columnLine">well to answer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Speak."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "By what right did you attack us in Philadelphia</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Fairmount Park?

No Atlantic liner</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have offered them more comfort. If they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not sleep soundly it was that they did not wish to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do so, or rather that their very real anxiety pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented them. In what adventure had they embarked ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">To what series of experiments had they been in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vited? How would the business end? and above</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, what was Robur going to do with them?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frycollin, the valet, was quartered forward in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin adjoining that of the cook. The neighborhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not displease him; he liked to rub shoulders with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great in this world. But if he finally went to sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was to dream of fall after fall, of projections</seg><seg type="columnLine">through space, which made his sleep a horrible night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, nothing could be quieter than this jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney through the atmosphere, whose currents had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown weaker with the evening. Beyond the rustling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the blades of the screws there was not a sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except now and then the whistle from some terres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial locomotive, or the calling of some animal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strange instinct! These terrestrial beings felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeronef glide over them, and uttered cries of terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it ^assed. On the morrow, the 14th of June, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">five o'clock, Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans were</seg><seg type="columnLine">844</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">walking on the deck of the Albatross. Nothing had 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed since the evening; there was a look-out</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, and the helmsman was in his glass cage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why was there a look-out? Was there any chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of collision with another such machine? Certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">not. Robur had not yet found imitators. The chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of encountering an aerostat gliding through the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too remote to be regarded. In any case it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be all the worse for the aerostat--the earthen pot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the iron pot. The Albatross had nothing to fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the collision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what could happen ? The aeronef might find</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself like a ship on a lee shore if a mountain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be outflanked or passed barred the way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These are the reefs of the air, and they have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided as a ship avoids the reefs of the sea. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer, it is true, had given the course, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing so had taken into account the altitude neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary to clear the summits of the high lands in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">district. But as the aeronef was rapidly nearing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountainous country, it was only prudent to keep a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good lookout, in case some slight deviation from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">course became necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking at the country beneath them, Uncle Pru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent and Phil Evans noticed a large lake, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower southern end the Albatross had just reached.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They concluded, therefore that during the night the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole length of Erie had been traversed, and that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they were going due west, they would soon be over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lake Michigan. "There can be no doubt of it," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phil Evans, "and that group of roofs on the horizon</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Chicago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was right. It was indeed the city from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seventeen railways diverge, the Queen of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">West, the vast reservoir into which flow the products</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Indiana, Ohio, Wir;onsin, Missouri, and all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">states which form the western half of the Union.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncle Prudent, through an excellent telescope he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found in his cabin, easily recognized the prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cipal buildings. His colleague pointed out to him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">churches and public edifices, the numerous "eleva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors" or mechanical granaries, and the huge Sherman</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hotel, whose windows seemed like a hundred glitter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing points on each of its faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If that is Chicago," said Uncle Prudent, "it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious that we are going farther west than is con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venient for us if we are to return to our starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, in fact, the Albatross was traveling in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight line from the Pennsylvania capital.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if Uncle Prudent wished to ask Robur to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">him eastwards he could not then do so. That morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the engineer did not leave his cabin. Either he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was occupied in some work, or else he was asleep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the two colleagues sat down to breakfast without</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The speed was the same as that during last eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning. The wind being easterly the rate was not in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terfered with at all, and as the thermometer only</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls a degree centigrade for every seventy meters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevation the temperature was not insupportable. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, in chatting and thinking and waiting for the engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neer, Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans walked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the forest of screws, whose gyratory move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment gave their arms the appearance of semi-diaph-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anous disks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The State of Illinois was left by its northern fron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tier in less than two hours and a half ; and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the Father of Waters, the Mississippi, whose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">double-decked steamboats seemed no bigger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoes. Then the Albatross flew over Iowa after</seg><seg type="columnLine">having sighted Iowa city about eleven o'clock in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few chains of hills, "bluffs" as they are called,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved across the face of the country trending from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south to the northwest, whose* moderate height</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessitated no rise in the course of the aeronef.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon the bluffs gave place to the large plains of</seg><seg type="columnLine">western Iowa and Nebraska--immense prairies ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tending all the way to the foot of the Rocky Moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains. Here and there were many "rios," affluents or</seg><seg type="columnLine">minor affluents of the Missouri. On their banks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">towns and villages, growing more scattered as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albatross sped farther west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing particular happened during this day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans were left entirely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves. They hardly noticed Frycollin sprawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">at full length in the bow, keeping his eyes shut so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could see nothing. And they were not at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked by vertigo, as might have been expected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no guiding mark, and there was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cause the vertigo, as there would have been on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of a lofty building. The abyss has no attrac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive power when it is gazed at from the car of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">balloon or deck of an aeronef. It is not an abyss</seg><seg type="columnLine">that opens beneath the aeronaut, but an horizon that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rises round him on all sides like a cup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a couple of hours the Albatross was over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Omaha, on the Nebraskan frontier--Omaha city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the real head of the Pacific Railway, that long line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rails, four thousand five hundred miles in length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretching from New York to San Francisco. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment they could see the yellow waters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Missouri, then the town, with its houses of wood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brick in the center of a rich basin, like a buckle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the iron belt which clasps North America round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist. Doubtless, also, as the passengers in the aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nef could observe all the details, the inhabitants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Omaha noticed the strange machine. Their astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment at seeing it gliding overhead could be no greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that of the president and secretary of the Wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don Institute at finding themselves on board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anyhow, the journals of the Union would be cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain to notice the fact. It would be the explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the astonishing phenomenon which the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world had been wondering over for some time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an hour the Albatross had left Omaha and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the Platte River, whose valley is followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pacific Railway in its route across the prairie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Things looked serious for Uncle Prudent and Phil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is real, then, this absurd project of taking us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Antipodes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And whether we like it or not!" exclaimed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. "Robur had better take care! I am not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to stand that sort of thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nor am I!" replied Phil Evans. "But be calm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Prudent, be calm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be calm!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And keep your temper until it is wanted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By five o'clock they had crossed the eastern coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tries covered with pines and poplars, and the Alba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tross was over the appropriately named Bad Lands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Nebraska--a chaos of ochre-colored hills, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountainous fragments fallen on the soil and broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their fall. At a distance these blocks take the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantastic shapes. Here and there amid this enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">game of knucklebones there could be traced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ROBUR THE CONQUEROR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">845</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginary ruins of mediaeval cities with forts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dungeons, pepper-box turrets, and machicolated</seg><seg type="columnLine">towers. And in truth these Bad Lands are an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense ossuary where lie bleaching in the sun myriads</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fragments of pachyderms, chelonians, and even,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some would have us believe, fossil men, overwhelmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by unknown cataclysms ages and ages ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN evening came the whole basin of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Platte River had been crossed, and the plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended to the extreme limits of the horizon, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose high owing to the altitude of the Albatross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the night there were no more shrill whistles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of locomotives or deeper notes of the river steamers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to trouble the quiet of the starry firmament. Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellowings occasionally reached the aeronef from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">herds of buffalo that roamed over the prairie in</seg><seg type="columnLine">search of water and pasturage. And when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased, the trampling of the grass under their feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced a dull roaring similar to the rushing of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flood, and very different from the continuous f-r-r-r-r</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the screws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then from time to time came the howl of a wolf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fox, a wild cat, or a coyote, the Cams latrans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose name is justified by his sonorous bark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Occasionally came penetrating odors of mint, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage, and absinthe, mingled with the more powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragrance of the conifers which rose floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the night air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last came a menacing yell, which was not due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the coyote.

A few forts to keep the Indians in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowned the bluffs with their geometric lines, formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">oftener of palisades than walls. There were few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">villages and few inhabitants, the country differing</seg><seg type="columnLine">widely from the auriferous lands of Colorado many</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues to the south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the distance a long line of mountain crests, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">great confusion as yet, began to appear.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeronef was at this altitude owing to the elevation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. An hour before she had been at a height</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 13,000 feet, and behind her were mountains cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with perpetual snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing Uncle Prudent and his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion could remember which would lead them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover where they were. During the night the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albatross had made several stretches north and south</seg><seg type="columnLine">at tremendous speed, and that was what had put</seg><seg type="columnLine">them out of their reckoning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After talking over several hypotheses more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">plausible they came to the conclusion that this coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try encircled with mountains must be the district</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared by an Act of Congress in March, 1872, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the National Park of the United States. A strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">region it was. It well merited the name of a park--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a park with mountains for hills, with lakes for ponds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rivers for streamlets, and with geysers of mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velous power instead of fountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes the Albatross glided across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yellowstone River, leaving Mount Stevenson on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, and coasting the largfe lake which bears the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of the stream. Great was the variety on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks of this basin, ribbed as they were with obsidian</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tiny crystals, reflecting the sunlight on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">myriad facets. Wonderful was the arrangement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the islands on its surface; magnificent were the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflections of the gigantic mirror. And around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake, one of the highest in the globe, were multitudes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pelicans, swans, gulls and bernicle geese and</seg><seg type="columnLine">divers. In places the steep banks were clothed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">green trees, pines and larches, and at the foot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">escarpments there shot upwards innumerable white</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumaroles, the vapor escaping from the soil as from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enormous reservoir in which the water is kept in</seg><seg type="columnLine">permanent ebullition by subterranean fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE cook might have seized the opportunity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">securing an ample supply of trout, the only fish</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Yellowstone Lake contains in myriads. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albatross kept on at such a height that there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of indulging in a catch which assuredly would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been miraculous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In three quarters of an hour the lake was passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, and a little farther on the last was seen of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">geyser region, which rivals the finest in Iceland.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leaning over the rail, Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the liquid columns which leaped up as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though to furnish the aeronef with a new element.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were the Fan, with the jets shot forth in rays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Fortress, which seemed to be defended by water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spouts, Old Faithful, with her plume crowned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rainbows, the Giant, spurting forth a vertical</seg><seg type="columnLine">846</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">torrent twenty feet round and more than two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet high.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Robur must evidently have been familiar with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">incomparable spectacle, unique in the world, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not appear 011 deck. Was it, then, for the sole</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure of his guests that he had brought the aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nef above the national domain? If so, he came not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to receive their thanks. He did not even trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself during the passage of the Rocky Mountains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Albatross approached at about seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By increasing the speed of her wings, as a bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising in its flight, the Albatross would clear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest ridges of the chain, and sink again over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oregon or Utah. But the maneuver was unnecessary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The passes allowed the barrier to be crossed without</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascending for the higher ridges. There are many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these canyons, or steep valleys, more or less narrow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which they could glide, such as Bridger</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canyon, through which runs the Pacific Railway into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mormon territory, and others to the north and</seg><seg type="columnLine">south of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was through one of these that the Albatross</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed, after slackening speed so as not to dash</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the walls of the canyon. The steersman, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sureness of hand rendered more effective by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensitiveness of the rudder, maneuvered his craft as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she were a crack racer in a Royal Victoria yacht</seg><seg type="columnLine">race. It was really extraordinary. I11 spite of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealousy of the two advocates of "lighter than air,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could not help being surprised at the perfection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this engine of aerial locomotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In less than two hours and a half they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the Rockies, and the Albatross had resumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her former speed of sixty-two miles an hour. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was steering south west _so as to cut across Utah</seg><seg type="columnLine">diagonally as she neared the ground. She had even</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped several hundred yards when the sound of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle attracted the attention of Uncle Prudent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phil Evans.	'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a train on the Pacific Railway on the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Salt Lake City.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, in obedience to an order secretly given,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Albatross dropped still lower so as to chase the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train, which was going at full speed. She was imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately sighted. A few heads showed themselves at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doors of the cars. Then numerous passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded the gangways. Some did not hesitate to</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb on the roof to get a better view of the flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine. Cheers came floating up through the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but 110 Robur appeared in answer to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Albatross continued her descent, slowing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevating screws and moderating her speed so as not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave the train behind. She flew about it like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous beetle or a gigantic bird of prey. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed off to the right and left, and swept on in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front, and hung behind, and proudly displayed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">flag with the golden sun, to which the conductor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the train replied by waving the Stars and Stripes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In vain the prisoners, in their desire to take advan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tage of the opportunity, endeavored to make them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves known to those below. In vain the president</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Weldon Institute roared forth at the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice, "I am Uncle Prudent of Philadelphia!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the secretary followed suit with, "I am Phil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evans, his colleague!" Their shouts were lost in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand cheers with which the passengers greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aeronef.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three or four of the crew of the Albatross had ap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">peared 011 the deck, and one of them, like sailors</seg><seg type="columnLine">when passing a ship less speedy than their own, held</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a rope, an ironical way of offering to tow them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then the Albatross resumed her original speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in half an hour the express was out of sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">About one o'clock there appeared a vast disk, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected the solar rays as if it were an immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That ought to be the Mormon capital, Salt Lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">City," said Uncle Prudent. And so it was, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disk was the roof of the Tabernacle, where ten thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand saints can worship at their ease. This vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome, like a convex mirror, threw off the rays of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun in all directions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It vanished like a shadow, and the Albatross sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her way to the southwest with a speed that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not felt, as it surpassed that of the chasing wind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon she was in Nevada, over the silver regions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Sierra separates from the golden lands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">California.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall certainly reach San Francisco before</seg><seg type="columnLine">night," said Phil Evans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then?" asked Uncle Prudent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was six o'clock precisely when the Sierra</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevada was crossed by the same pass as that taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the railway. Only a hundred and eighty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">then separated them from San Francisco, the Cali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fornian capital.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the speed the Albatross was going she would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the city by eight o'clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this moment Robur appeared on deck. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">colleagues walked up to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Engineer Robur," said Uncle Prudent, " we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">now on the confines of America! We think the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">has come for this joke to end."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I never joke," said Robur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He raised his hand. The Albatross swiftly dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the ground, and at the same time such speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was given her as to drive the prisoners into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as the door was shut, Uncle Prudent</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed, "I could strangle him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must try to escape!" said Phil Evans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes; cost what it may!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A long murmur greeted their ears. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating of the surf on the seashore. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pacific Ocean!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Wide Pacific</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UNCLE PRUDENT and Phil Evans had quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up their minds to escape. If they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">■ not had to deal with the eight particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigorous men who composed the crew of the aeronef</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might have tried to succeed by main force. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they were only two--for Frycollin could only be</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered as a quantity of no importance--force</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not to be thought of. Hence recourse must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to strategy as soon as the Albatross again took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. Such was what Phil Evans endeavored</seg><seg type="columnLine">to impress on his irascible colleague, though he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in constant fear of Prudent aggravating matters by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some premature outbreak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In any case the present was not the time to attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything of the sort. The aeronef was sweeping along</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the North Pacific. On the following morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of June 16th, the coast was out of sight. And as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ROBUR THE CONQUEROR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">847</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the coast curves off from Vancouver Island up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Aleutians--belonging to that portion of America</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceded by Russia to the United States in 1867--it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly probable that the Albatross would cross it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the curve, if her course remained un^</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long the night appeared to be to the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends! How eager they were to get out of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabins! When they came on deck in the morning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn had for some hours been silvering the eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon. They were nearing the June solstice, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when there is hardly any night along the sixtieth</seg><seg type="columnLine">parallel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Either from custom or intention Robur was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">no hurry to leave his deck-house. When he came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning he contented himself with bowing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his two guests as he passed them in the stern of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeronef.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now Frycollin ventured out of his cabin. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes red with sleeplessness, and dazed in their look,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tottered along like a man whose foot feels it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not on solid ground. His first glance was at the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vating screws, which were working with gratifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularity without any signs of haste.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That done, the negro stumbled along to the rail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grasped it with both hands, so as to make sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his balance. Evidently he wished to view the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country over which the Albatross was flying at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of seven hundred feet or more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first he kept himself well back behind the rail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he shook it to make sure it was firm; then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew himself up; then he bent forward; then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched out his head. It need not be said that while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was executing these different maneuvers he kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes shut. At last he opened them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What a shout! And how quickly he fled! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">how deeply his head sank back into his shoulders!</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the bottom of the abyss he had seen the immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean. His hair would have risen on end--if it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been wool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sea! the sea!" he cried. And Frycollin would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have fallen on the deck had not the cook opened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms to receive him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This cook was a Frenchman, and probably a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gascon, his name being Francois Tapage. If he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a Gascon he must in his infancy have inhaled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breezes of the Garonne. How did this Franqois</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tapage find himself in the service of the engineer?</seg><seg type="columnLine">By what chain of accidents had he become one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew of the Albatross? We can hardly say; but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any case he spoke English like a Yankee. "Eh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand up!" said he, lifting the negro by a vigorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutch at the waist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Master Tapage!" said the poor fellow, giving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">despairing look at the screws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At your service, Frycollin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did this thing ever smash?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, but it will end by smashing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why? Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because everything must end."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the sea is beneath us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we are to fall, it is better to fall in the sea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall be drowned."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall be drowned, but we shall not be smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a jelly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next moment Frycollin was on all fours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeping to the back of his cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During this day the aeronef was only driven at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moderate speed. She seemed to skim the placid</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the sea, which lay glistening in the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine about a hundred feet beneath. Uncle Prudent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his companion remained in their cabin, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did not meet with Robur, who walked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking alone or talking to the mate. Only half the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screws were working, yet that was enough to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the apparatus afloat in the lower zones of the atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crew, as a change from the ordinary routine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have endeavored to catch a few fish, had there</seg><seg type="columnLine">been any sign of them; but all that could be seen on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of the sea were a few of those yellow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellied whales which measure about eighty feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length. These are the most formidable cetaceans in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the northern seas, and whalers are very careful in</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacking them, for their strength is prodigious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, in harpooning one of these whales, either</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ordinary harpoon, the Fletcher fuse, or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">javelin-bomb, of which there was an assortment on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, there would have been no danger to the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Albatross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what was the good of such useless massacre?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doubtless to show off the powers of the aeronef</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the members of the Weldon Institute. And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">Robur gave orders for the capture of one of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous cetaceans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the shout of "A whale! a whale!" Uncle Prudent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Phil Evans came out of their cabin. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a whaler in sight! In that case all they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do to escape from their flying prison was to jump</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sea, and chance being picked up by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crew were all on deck. "Shall we try, sir?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Tom Turner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Robur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the engine-room the engineer and his assistant</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at their posts ready to obey the orders signaled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them. The Albatross dropped towards the sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and remained, about fifty feet above it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no ship in sight--of that the two col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues soon assured themselves--nor was there any</seg><seg type="columnLine">land to be seen to which they could swim, providing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Robur made no attempt to recapture them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several jets of water from the spout holes soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced the presence of the whales as they came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface to breathe. Tom Turner and one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were in the bow. Within his reach was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those javelin-bombs, of California make which are</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot from an arquebus and which are shaped like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a metallic cylinder terminated by a cylindrical bomb</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed with a shaft having a barbed point. Robur</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little farther aft, and with his right hand sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naled to the engineers, while with his left he directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steersman. He thus controlled the aeronef in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every way, horizontally and vertically, and it is al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most impossible to conceive with what speed and pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision the Albatross, answered to his orders. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed a living being, of which he was the soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A whale! a whale!" shouted Tom Turner, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of a cetacean emerged from the surface about</seg><seg type="columnLine">four cable-lengths in front of the Albatross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Albatross swept towards it, and when she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">within sixty feet of it she stopped dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom Turner seized the arquebus, which was rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing against a cleat on the rail. He fired, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectile, attached to a long line, entered the whale's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. The bomb, filled with an explosive compound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">848</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">burst, and shot out a small harpoon with two</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches, which fastened into the animal's flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Look out!" shouted Turner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans, much against their</seg><seg type="columnLine">will, became greatly interested ip the spectacle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The whale, seriously wounded, gave the sea such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slap with his tail, that the water dashed up over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow of the aeronef. Then he plunged to great depth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the line, which had been previously wetted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tub of water to prevent its taking fire, ran out</seg><seg type="columnLine">like lightning. When the whale rose to the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">he started off at full speed in a northerly direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It may be imagined with what speed the Albatross</seg><seg type="columnLine">was towed in pursuit. Besides, the propellers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been stopped. The whale was let go as he would,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ship followed him. Turner stood ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut the line in case a fresh plunge should render this</seg><seg type="columnLine">towing dangerous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For half an hour, and perhaps for a distance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">six miles, the Albatross was thus dragged along, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was obvious that the whale was tiring. Then, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gesture from Robur, the assistant engineers started</seg><seg type="columnLine">the propellers astern, so as to oppose a certain re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance to the whale, who was gradually getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Soon the aeronef was gliding about twenty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet above him. His tail was beating the waters with</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible violence, and as he turned over on his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enormous wave was produced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUDDENLY the whale turned up again, so as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a header, as it were, and then dived with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such rapidity that Turner had barely time to cut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The aeronef was dragged to the very surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water. A whirlpool w~s formed where the ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal had disappeared. A wave dashed up on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck as if the aeronef were a ship driving against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind and tide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Luckily, with a blow of the hatchet the mate sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the line, and the Albatross, freed from her tug,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang aloft six hundred feet under the impulse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ascensional screws. Robur had maneuvered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship without losing his coolness for a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A few minutes afterwards the whale returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface--dead. From every side the birds flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on to the carcass, and their cries were enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to deafen a congress. The Albatross, without stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping to share in the spoil, resumed her course to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the morning of the 17th of June, at about six</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock, land was sighted on the horizon. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peninsula of Alaska, and the long range of break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers of the Aleutian Islands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Albatross glided over the barrier where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">. fur seals swarm for the benefit of the Russo-Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can Company. An excellent business is the capture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these amphibians, which are from six to seven feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, russet in color, and weigh from three hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to four hundred pounds. There they were in inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minable files, ranged in line of battle, and countable</seg><seg type="columnLine">by thousands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Although they did not move at the passage of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albatross, it was otherwise with the ducks, divers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and loons, whose husky cries filled the air as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared beneath the waves and fled terrified from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aerial monster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The twelve hundred miles of the Behring Sea be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the first of the Aleutians and the extreme end</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of Kamtschatka were traversed during the twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hours of this day and the following night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans found that there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no present chance of putting their project of escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">into execution. Flight was not to be thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the deserts of Eastern Asia, nor on the coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea of Okhotsk. Evidently the Albatross was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound for Japan or China, and there, although it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not perhaps quite safe to trust themselves to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercies of the Chinese or Japanese, the two friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made up their minds to run if the aeronef</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But would she stop? She was not like a bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">which grows fatigued by too long a flight, or like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">balloon which has to descend for want of gas. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">still had food for many weeks, and her organs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">of marvelous strength, defying all weakness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">weariness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the 18th of June she swept over the penin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sula of Kamtschatka, and during the day there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of Petropaulovski and the volcano of Klout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">schew. Then she rose again to cross the Sea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Okhotsk, running down by the Kurile Isles, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be a breakwater pierced by hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">channels. On the 19th, in the morning, the Alba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tross was over the strait of La Perouse between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saghalien and Northern Japan, and had reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of the great Siberian river, the Amoor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there came on a fog so dense that the aeronef</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to rise above it. At the altitude she was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no obstacle to be feared, no elevated monuments</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hinder her passage, no mountains against which</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was risk of being shattered in her flight. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">country was only slightly varied. But the fog was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very disagreeable, and made everything on board</seg><seg type="columnLine">very damp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that was necessary was to get above this bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mist, which was nearly thirteen hundred feet thick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ascensional screws being increased in speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Albatross was soon clear of the fog and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunny regions of the sky.

In the breath of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wind these slips, with all their notes varied like those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a harmonicon, gave forth a most melancholy mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">muring.

Long years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago that valley lay so far open to the world that men</seg><seg type="columnLine">might come at last through frightful gorges and over</seg><seg type="columnLine">an icy pass into its equable meadows; and thither</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed men came, a family or so of Peruvian half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeds fleeing from the lust and tryanny of an evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish ruler. Then came the stupendous outbreak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mindobamba, when it was night in Quito for</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventeen days, and the water was boiling at Yagu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">achi and all the fish floating dying even as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guayaquil; everywhere along the Pacific slopes there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were land-slips and swift thawings and sudden floods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one whole side of the old Arauca crest slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came down in thunder, and cut off the Country</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Blind for ever from the exploring feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. But one of these early settlers had chanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be on the hither side of the gorges when the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">had so terribly shaken itself, and he perforce had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget his wife and his child and all the friends and</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessions he had left up there, and Start life over</seg><seg type="columnLine">again in the lower world. He started it again but</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill, blindness overtook him, and he died of punith-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in the mines; but the story he told begot a legend</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lingers along the length of the Cordilleras of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andes to this day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told of his reason for venturing back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fastness, into which he had first been carried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed to a llama, beside a vast bale of gear, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a child. The valley, he said, had in it all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart of man could desire--sweet water, pasture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even climate, slopes of rich brown soil with tan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gles of a shrub that bore an excellent fruit, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side great hanging forests of pine that held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">avalanches high. Far overhead, on three sides, vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs of gray-green rock were capped by cliffs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice; but the glacier stream came not to them but</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowed away by the farther slopes, and only now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then huge ice masses fell on the valley side. In this</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley it neither rained nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">snowed, but the abundant</seg><seg type="columnLine">springs gave a rich green</seg><seg type="columnLine">pasture, that irrigation</seg><seg type="columnLine">would spread over all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley space. The settlers</seg><seg type="columnLine">did well indeed there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Their beasts did well and</seg><seg type="columnLine">multiplied, and but one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing marred their happi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. Yet it was enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mar it greatly. A strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease had come upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and had made all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the children born to them there--and indeed, several</seg><seg type="columnLine">older children also--blind. It was to seek some</seg><seg type="columnLine">charm or antidote against this plague of blindness</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had with fatigue and danger and difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned down the gorge. In those days, in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases, men did not think of germs and infections but</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sins; and it seemed to him that the reason of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">affliction must lie in the negligence of these priestless</seg><seg type="columnLine">immigrants to set up a shrine so soon as they entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley. He wanted a shrine--a handsome, cheap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">effectual shrine--to be erected in the valley; he want-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed relics and such-like potent things of faith, blessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects and mysterious medals and prayers. Tn his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wallet he had a bar of native silver for which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not account; he insisted there was none in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vallej. with something of the insistence of an inexpert</seg><seg type="columnLine">liar. They had all clubbed their money and orna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments together, having little need for such treasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">up there, he said, to buy them holy help against their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill. 1 figure this dim-eyed young mountaineer, sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burnt, gaunt, and anxious, hat-brim clutched fever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishly, a man all unused to the ways of the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, telling this story to some keen-eyed attentive</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest before the great convulsion; I can picture him</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently seeking to return with pious and infallible</seg><seg type="columnLine">remedies against that trouble, and the infinite dismay</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which he must have faced the tumbled vastness</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the gorge had once come out. But the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his story of mischances is lost to me, save that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know of his evil death after several years. Poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">stray from that remoteness! The stream that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once made the gorge now bursts from the mouth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rocky cave, and the legend his poor, ill-told story</seg><seg type="columnLine">set going developed into the legend of a race of blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">men somewhere "over there," which one may still</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear today.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND amidst the little population of that now iso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated and forgotten valley the disease ran its</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. The old became groping and purblind, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young saw but dimly, and the children that were born</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them saw never at all. But life was very easy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that snow-rimmed basin, lost to all the world, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither thorns nor briars, with no evil insects nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">any beasts save the gentle breed of llamas they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lugged and thrust and followed up the beds of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrunken rivers in the gorges up which they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. The seeing had become purblind so gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally that they scarcely no' -d their loss. They guided</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sightless" youngsters hither and thither until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the whole valley marvellously, and when at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight died out among them the race lived on. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had even time to adapt themselves to the blind con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol of fire, which they made carefully in stoves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. They were a simple strain of people at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, unlettered, only slightly touched with the Span-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish civilization, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of a tradition</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the arts of old Peru</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of its lost philosophy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Generation followed gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eration. They forgot many</seg><seg type="columnLine">things; they devised many</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. Their tradition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greater world they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from became mythi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal in color and uncertain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In all things save sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were strong and able,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently the chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of birth and heredity sent one who had an original</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind and who could talk and persuade among them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then afterwards another. These two passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving their effects, and the little community grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">in numbers and in understanding, and met and set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled social and economic problems that arose. Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eration followed generation. There came a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a child was born who was fifteen generations</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that ancestor who went out of the valley with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bar of silver to seek God's aid, and who never</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned. Thereabouts it chanced that a man came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into this community from the outer world.

He came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself with a dim fancy that he was ill in bed; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">realised his position with a mountaineer's intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence, and worked himself loose and, after a rest or</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, out until he saw the stars. He rested flat upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest for a space, wondering where he was and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had happened to him. He explored his limbs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and discovered that several of his buttons were gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his coat turned over his head. His knife had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone from his pocket and his hat was lost, though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tied it under his chin. He recalled that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been looking for loose stones to raise his piece of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter wall. His ice-axe had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He decided he must have fallen, and looked up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, exaggerated by the ghastly light of the rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, the tremendous flight he had taken. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he lay, gazing blankly at that vast pale cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">towering above, rising moment by moment out of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">subsiding tide of darkness. Its phantasmal, mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious beauty held him for a space, and then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seized with a paroxysm of sobbing laughter. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a great interval of time he became aware</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was near the lower edge of the snow. Below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">down what was now a moonlit and practicable slope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the dark and broken appearance of rock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strewn turf. He struggled to his feet, aching in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every joint and limb, got down painfully from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaped loose snow about him, went downward until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was on the turf, and there dropped rather than lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside a boulder, drank deep from the flask in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner pocket, and instantly fell asleep. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was awakened by the singing of birds in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees far below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat up and perceived he was on a little alp at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foot of a vast precipice, that was grooved by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gully down which he and his snow had come. Over</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him another wall of rock reared itself against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky. The gorge betweengthese precipices ran east</seg><seg type="columnLine">and west and was full of the morning sunlight, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit to the westward the mass of fallen mountain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the descending gorge. Below him it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a precipice equally steep, but behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow in the gully he found a sort of chimney-cleft</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripping with snow-water down which a desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">man might venture. He found it easier than it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, and came at last to another desolate alp, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then after a rock climb of no particular difficulty, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a steep slope of trees. He took his bearings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned his face up the gorge, for he saw it opened out</seg><seg type="columnLine">above upon green meadows, among which he now</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpsed quite distinctly a cluster of stone huts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfamiliar fashion-. At times his progress was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">clambering along the face of a wall, and after a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rising sun ceased to strike along the gorge, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices of the singing birds died away, and the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew cold and dark about him. But the distant valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its houses was all the brighter for that. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">came presently to talus, and among the rocks he</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted--for he was an observant man--an unfamiliar</seg><seg type="columnLine">fern that seemed to clutch out of the crevices with</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense green hands. He picked a frond or so and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnawed its stalk and found it helpful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About midday he came at last out of the throat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gorge into the plain and the sunlight. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff and weary; he sat down in the shadow of a rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled up his flask with water from a spring and drank</seg><seg type="columnLine">it down, and remained for a time resting before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on to the houses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were very strange to his eyes, and indeed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole aspect of that valley became, as he regarded it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">queerer and more unfamiliar. The greater part of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface was lush green meadow, starred with many</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful flowers, irrigated with extraordinary care,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bearing evidence of systematic cropping piece by</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece. High up and ringing the valley about was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, and what appeared to be a circumferential</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-channel, from which the little trickles of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fed the meadow plants came, and 011 the higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">slopes above this flocks of llamas cropped the scanty</seg><seg type="columnLine">herbage. Sheds, apparently shelters or feeding-places</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the llamas, stood against the boundary wall here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there. The irrigation streams ran together into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">main channel down the centre of the valley, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was enclosed on either side by a wall breast high.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This gave a singularly urban quality to this secluded</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, a quality that was greatly enhanced by the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a number of paths paved with black and white</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones, and each with a curious little kerb at the side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran hither and thither in an orderly manner. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses of the central village were quite unlike the</seg><seg type="columnLine">casual and higgledy-piggledy agglomeration of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  --- . ^</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain villages he knew; they stood in a continu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous row on either side of a central street of</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishing cleanness; here and there their parti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coloured facade was pierced by a door, and not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solitary window broke their even frontage. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were parti-coloured with extraordinary irregularity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smeared with a sort of plaster that was sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray, sometimes drab, sometimes slate-coloured or</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark brown; and it was the sight of this wild plaster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing first brought the word "blind" into the thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the explorer. "The good man who did that," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, "must have been as blind as a bat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE descended a steep place, and so came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall and channel that ran about the valley, near</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the latter spouted out its surplus contents into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deeps of the gorge in a thin and wavering thread</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cascade. He could now see a number of men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women resting on piled heaps of grass, as if taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">a siesta, in the remoter part of the meadow, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer the village a number of recumbent children,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then nearer at hand three men carrying pails on</seg><seg type="columnLine">yokes along a little path that ran from the encircling</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall towards the houses. These latter were clad in</seg><seg type="columnLine">garments of llama cloth and boots and belts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather, and they wore caps of cloth with back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear flaps. They followed one another in single file,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking slowly and yawning as they walked, like men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who have been up all night. There was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">so reassuringly prosperous and respectable in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing that after a moment's hesitation Nunez stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward as conspicuously as possible upon his rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave vent to a mighty shout that echoed round</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three men stopped, and moved their heads as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they were looking about them. They turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces this way and that, and Nunez gesticulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with freedom. But they did not appear to see him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all his gestures, and after a time, directing them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves towards the mountains far away to the right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they shouted as if in answer. Nunez bawled again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then once more, and as he gestured ineffectually</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word "blind" came up to the top of his thoughts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The fools must be blind," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When at last, after much shouting and wrath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nunez crossed the stream by a little bridge, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a gate in the wall, and approached them, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sure that they were blind. He was sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was the Country of the Blind of which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">legends told. Conviction had sprung upon him, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of great and rather enviable adventure. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">three stood side by side, not looking at him, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ears directed towards him, judging him by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfamiliar steps. They stood close together like men</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little afraid, and he could see their eyelids closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sunken, as though the very balls beneath had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrunk away. There was an expression near awe</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man," one said, in hardly recognisable Spanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">--"a man it is--a man or a spirit--coming down</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rocks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Nunez advanced with the confident steps of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth who enters upon life. All the old stories of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost valley and the Country of the Blind had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to his mind, and through his thoughts ran this</seg><seg type="columnLine">old proverb, as if it were a refrain--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the Country of the Blind the One-eyed Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">is King."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE COUNTRY OF THE BLIND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">8.53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I "In the Country of the Blind the One-eyed Man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is King."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">| And very civilly he gave them greeting. He talked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to them and used his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">| "Where does he come from, brother Pedro ?" asked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' "Down out of the rocks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">| "Over the mountains I come," said Nunez, "out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the country beyond there--where men can see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">From near Bogota, where there are a hundred thou-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sands of people, and where the city passes out of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">| "Sight?" muttered Pedro. "Sight?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">! "He comes," said the second blind man, "out of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the rocks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The cloth of their coats Nunez saw was curiously</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fashioned, each with a different sort of stitching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They startled him by a simultaneous movement to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wards him, each with a hand outstretched. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stepped back from the advance of these spread</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Come hither," said the third blind man, following</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his motion and clutching him neatly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And they held Nunez and felt him over, saying no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">word further until they had done so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Carefully," he cried, with a finger in his eye, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">found they thought that organ, with its fluttering</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lids, a queer thing in him. They went over it again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"A strange creature, Correa," said the one called</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pedro. "Feel the coarseness of his hair. Like a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">llama's hair."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Rough he is as the rocks that begot him," said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Correa, investigating Nunez's unshaven chin with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soft and slightly moist hand. "Perhaps he will grow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">finer." Nunez struggled a little under their examina-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion, but they gripped him firmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Carefully," he said again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"He speaks," said the third man. "Certainly he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is a man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Ugh!" said Pedro, at the roughness of his coat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And you have come into the world?" asked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pedro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Out of the world. Over mountains and glaciers;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">right over above there, half-way to the sun. Out of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the great big world that goes down, twelve days'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">journey to the sea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They scarcely seemed to heed him. "Our fathers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have told us men may be made by the forces of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nature," said Correa. "It is the warmth of things</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and moisture, and rottenness--rottenness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Let us lead him to the elders," said Pedro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Shout first," said Correa, "lest the children be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">afraid. This is a marvellous occasion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">So they shouted, and Pedro went first and took</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nunez by the hand to lead him to the houses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He drew his hand away. "I can see," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"See?" said Correa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, see," said Nunez, turning towards him, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stumbled against Pedro's pail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"His senses are still imperfect," said the third</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blind man. "He stumbles, and talks unmeaning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">words. Lead him by the hand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"As you will," said Nunez, and was led along,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">laughing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It seemed they knew nothing of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Well, all in good time he would teach them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He heard people shouting, and saw a number of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">figures gathering together in the middle roadway of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the village.</seg><seg type="columnLine">854</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He found it taxed his nerve and patience more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he had anticipated, that first encounter with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">population of the Country of the Blind. The place</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed larger as he drew near to it, and the smeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">plasterings queerer, and a crowd of children and men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women (the women and girls, he was pleased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">note, had some of them quite sweet faces, for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that their eyes were shut and sunken) came about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, holding on to him, touching him with soft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensitive hands, smelling at him, and listening at</seg><seg type="columnLine">every word he spoke. Some of the maidens and chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren, however, kept aloof as if afraid, and indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice seemed coarse, and rude beside their softer</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes. They mobbed him. His three guides kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to him with an effect of proprietorship, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said again and again, "A wild man out of the rocks."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bogota," he said. "Bogota. Over the mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">crests."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"A wild man--using wild words," said Pedro.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did you hear that--Bogota? His mind is hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed yet. He .has only the beginnings of speech."</seg><seg type="columnLine">A little boy nipped his hand. "Bogota!" he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">mockingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ay! A city to your village. I come from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great world--where men have eyes and see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "His name's Bogota," they said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He stumbled," said Correa, "stumbled twice as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we came hither."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Bring him to the elders."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND they thrust him suddenly through a doorway</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">into a room as black as pitch, save at the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">there faintly glowed a fire. The crowd closed in be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him and shut out all but the faintest glimmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of day, and before he could arrest himself he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen headlong over the fe„ of a seated man. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, outflung, struck the face of some one else as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went down; he felt the soft impact of features</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heard a cry of anger, and for a moment he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled against a number of hands that clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. It was a one-sided fight. An inkling of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation came to him, and he lay quiet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I fell down," he said; "I couldn't see in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitchy darkness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was a pause as if the unseen persons about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him tried to understand his words. Then the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Correa said: "He is but newly formed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbles as he walks and mingles words that mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, with his speech."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Others also said things about him that he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">or understood imperfectly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "May I sit up?" he asked, in a pause. "I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not struggle against you again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They consulted and let him rise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The voice of an older man began to question him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Nunez found himself trying to explain the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">world out of which he had fallen, and the sky and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains and sight and such-like marvels, to these</seg><seg type="columnLine">riders who sat in darkness in the Country of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blind. And they would believe and understand noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing whatever he told them, a thing quite outside his</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectation. They would not even understand many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his words. For fourteen generations these people</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been blind and cut off from all the seeing world;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the names for all the things of sight had faded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed; the story of the outer world was faded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed to a child's story; and they had ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">concern themselves with anything beyond the rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">slopes above their circling wall. Blind men of genius</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had arisen among them and questioned the shreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of belief and tradition they had brought with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their seeing days, and had dismissed all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things as idle fancies, and replaced them with new</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saner explanations. Much of their imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shrivelled with their eyes, and they had made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves new imaginations with their ever more</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensitive ears and finger-tips. Slowly Nunez realised</seg><seg type="columnLine">this; that his expectation of wonder and reverence</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his origin and his gifts was not to be borne out;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after his poor attempt to explain sight to them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been set aside as the confused version of a new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">made being, describing the marvels of his incoherent</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensations, he subsided, a little dashed, ijito listen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to their instruction. And the eldest of the blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">men explained to him life and philosophy and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligion, how that the world (meaning their valley) had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been first an empty hollow in the rocks, and then had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, first, inanimate things without the gift of</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch, and llamas and a few other creatures that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">little sense, and then men, and at last angels, whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">one could hear singing and making fluttering sounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but whom no one could touch at all, which puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nunez greatly until he thought of the birds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went on to tell Nunez how this time had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided into the warm and the cold, which are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind equivalents of day and night, and how it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">good to sleep in the warm and work during the cold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that now, but for his advent, the whole town of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind would have been asleep. He said Nunez must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been specially created to learn and serve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisdom they had acquired, and that for all his mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">incoherency and stumbling behaviour he must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage and do his best to learn, and at that all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people in the doorway murmured encouragingly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the night--for the blind call their day night--</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now far gone, and it behooved every one to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to sleep. He asked Nunez if he knew how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, and Nunez said he did, but that before sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wanted food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They brought him food--llama's milk in a bowl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rough salted bread--and led him into a lonely</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to eat out of their hearing, and afterwards to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumber until the chill of the mountain evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">roused them to begin their day again. But Nunez</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumbered not at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Instead, he sat up in the place where they had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, resting his limbs and turning the unanticipated</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances of his arrival over and over in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every now and then he laughed, sometimes with</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement, and sometimes with indignation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Unformed mind!" he said. "Got no senses yet!</seg><seg type="columnLine">They little know they've been insulting their heaven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent king and master. I see I must bring them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason. I^et me think--let me think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was still thinking when the sun set.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nunez had an eye for all beautiful things, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to him that the glow upon the snowfields and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glaciers that rose about the valley on every side was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">went from that inaccessible glory to the village and</seg><seg type="columnLine">irrigated fields, fast sinking into the twilight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly a wave of emotion took him, and he thanked</seg><seg type="columnLine">God from the bottom of his heart that the power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight had been given him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard a voice calling to him from out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">village. "Ya ho there, Bogota! Come hither!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that he stood up smiling. He would show these</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE COUNTRY OF THE BLIND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">855</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">people once and for all what sight would do for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. They would seek him, but not find him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You move not, Bogota," said the voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed noiselessly, and made two stealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps aside from the path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trample not on the grass, Bogota; that is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nunez had scarcely heard the sound he made him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. He stopped amazed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The owner of the voice came running up the pie-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bald path towards him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped back into the pathway. "Here I am,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why did you not come when I called you?" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blind man. "Must you be led like a child? Can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not you hear the path as you walk ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nunez laughed. "I can see it," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There is no such word as see," said the blind man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a pause. "Cease this folly, and follow the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my feet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Nunez followed, a little annoyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My time will come," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll learn," the blind man answered. "There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to learn in the world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Has no one told you, 'In the Country of the Blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the One-eyed Man is King?' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is blind?" asked the blind man carelessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOUR days passed, and the fifth found the King</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Blind still incognito, as a clumsy and use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less stranger among his subjects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was, he found, much more difficult to proclaim</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself than he had supposed, and in the meantime,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he meditated his coup d'etat, he did what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was told and learnt the manners and customs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Country of the Blind. He found working and going</seg><seg type="columnLine">about at night a particularly irksome thing, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided that that should be the first thing he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">change.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They led a simple, laborious life, these people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all the elements of virtue and happiness, as these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things can be understood by men. They toiled, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not oppressively; they had food and clothing suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient for their needs; they had days and seasons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest; they made much of music and singing, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was love among them, and little children.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was marvellous with what confidence and preci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion they went about their ordered world. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. you see, had been made to fit their needs; each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the radiating paths of the valley area had a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant angle to the others, and was distinguished by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">special notch upon its kerbing; all obstacles and ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularities of path or meadow had long since been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared away; all their methods and procedure arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally from their special needs. Their senses had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become marvellously acute; they could hear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge the slightest gesture of a man a dozen paces</seg><seg type="columnLine">away--could hear the very beating of his heart. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonation had long replaced expression with them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">touches gesture, and their work with hoe and spade</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fork was as free and confident as garden work</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be. Their sense of smell was extraordinarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine; they could distinguish individual differences as</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily as a dog can, and they went about the tend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the llamas, who lived among the rocks above</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came to the wall for food and shelter, with ease</seg><seg type="columnLine">and confidence. It was only when at last Nunez</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sought to assert himself that he found how easy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">confident their movements could be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rebelled only after he had tried persuasion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried at first on several occasions to tell them</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight. "Look you here, you people," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There are things you do not understand in me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once or twice one or two of them attended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; they sat with faces downcast and ears turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligently towards him, and he did his best to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them what it was to see. Among his hearers was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, with eyelids less red and sunken than the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that one could almost fancy she was hiding eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom especially he hoped to persuade. He spoke of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beauties of sight, of watching the mountains, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky and the sunrise, and they heard him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">amused incredulity that presently became condem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natory. They told him there were indeed no moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains at all, but that the end of the rocks where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">llamas grazed was indeed the end of the world;</seg><seg type="columnLine">thence sprang a cavernous roof of the universe, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the dew and the avalanches fell; and when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintained stoutly the world had neither end nor roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as they supposed, they said his thoughts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wicked. So far as he could describe sky and clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stars to them it seemed to them a hideous void,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a terrible blankness in the place of the smooth roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">to things in which they believed--it was an article</seg><seg type="columnLine">of faith with them that the cavern roof was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quisitely smooth to the touch. He saw that in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner he shocked them, and gave up that aspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the matter altogether, and tried to show them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical value of sight. One morning he saw Pedro</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the path called Seventeen and coming towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">central houses, but still too far off for hearing or</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent, and he told them as much. "In a little while,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he prophesied, "Pedro will je here." An old man re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked that Pedro had no business on Path Seven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen, and then, as if in confirmation, that individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he drew near turned and went transversely into</seg><seg type="columnLine">path Ten, and so back with nimble paces towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer wall. They mocked Nunez when Pedro did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not arrive, and afterwards, when he asked Pedro</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions to clear his character, Pedro denied and</seg><seg type="columnLine">outfaced him, and was afterwards hostile to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he induced them to let him go a long way up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sloping meadows towards the wall with one com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placent individual, and to him he promised to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribe all that happened among the houses. He noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain goings and comings, but the things that really</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to signify to these people happened inside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">or behind the windowless houses--the only things</seg><seg type="columnLine">they took note of to test him by--and of these he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see or tell nothing; and it was after the failure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this attempt, and the ridicule they could not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press, that he resorted to force. He thought of seiz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a spade and suddenly smiting one or two of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth, and so in fair combat showing the advantage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of eyes. He went so far with that resolution as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seize his spade, and then he discovered a new thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about himself, and that was that it was impossible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to hit a blind man in cold blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hesitated, and found them all aware that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had snatched up the spade. They stood alert, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads on one side, and bent ears towards him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for what he would do next.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put that spade down," said one, and he felt a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of helpless horror. He came near obedience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he thrust one backwards against a house</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, and fled past him anr mit of the village.</seg><seg type="columnLine">856</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE went athwart one of their meadows, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">a track of trampled grass behind his feet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently sat down by the side of one of their ways.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt something of the buoyancy that comes to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in the beginning of a fight, but more perplexity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He began to realise that you cannot even fight hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pily with creatures who stand upon a different mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">basis to yourself. Far away he saw a number of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying spades and sticks come out of the street of</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses, and advance in a spreading line along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">several paths towards him. They advanced slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking frequently to one another, and ever and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again the whole cordon would halt and sniff the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and listen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first time they did this Nunez laughed. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterwards he did not laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One struck his trail in the meadow grass, and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooping and feeling his way along it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For five minutes he watched the slow extension</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cordon, and then his vague disposition to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">something forthwith became frantic. He stood up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">went a space or so towards the circumferential wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, and went back a little way. There they all</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in a crescent, still and listening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He also stood still, gripping his spade very tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in both hands. Should he charge them ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pulse in his ears ran into the rhythm of "In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Country of the Blind the One-eyed Man is</seg><seg type="columnLine">King!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Should he charge them?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked back at the high and unclimbable wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind--unclimbable because of its smooth plaster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. but withal pierced with many little doors, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approaching line of seekers. Behind these others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now coming out of the street of houses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Should he charge therw?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bogota!" called one. "Bogota! where are you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gripped his spade still tighter, and advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the meadows towards the place of habitations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and directly he moved they converged upon him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll hit them if they touch me," he swore; "by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heaven, I will. I'll hit." He called aloud, "Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, I'm going to do what I like in this valley. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you hear? I'm going to do what I like and go where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I like!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were moving in upon him quickly, groping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet moving rapidly. It was like playing blind man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">buff, with every one blindfolded except one. "Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold of him !" cried one. He found himself in the arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a loose curve of pursuers. He felt suddenly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be active and resolute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't understand," he cried in a voice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was meant to be great and resolute, and which broke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are blind, and I can see. Leave me alone!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bogota! Put down that spade, and come off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last order, grotesque in its urban familiarity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced a gust of anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll hurt you," he said, sobbing with emotion. "By</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heaven. I'll hurt you. Leave me alone!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began to run. not knowing clearly where to</seg><seg type="columnLine">run. He ran from the nearest blind man, because it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a horror to hit him. He stopped, and then made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dash to escape from their closing ranks. He made</seg><seg type="columnLine">for where a gap was wide, and the men on either side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a quick perception of the approach of his paces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed in on one another. He sprang forward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then saw he must be caught, and swish! the spade</seg><seg type="columnLine">had struck. He felt the soft thud of hand and arm,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and the man was down with a yell of pain, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through! And then he was close to the street of</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses again, and blind men, whirling spades and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stakes, were running with a sort of reasoned swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness hither and thither.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard steps behind him just in time, and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tall man rushing forward and swiping at the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him. He lost his nerve, hurled his spade a yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide at his antagonist, and whirled about and fled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly yelling as he dodged another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was panic-stricken. He ran furiously to and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fro, dodging when there was no need to dodge, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his anxiety to see on every side of him at once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbling. For a moment he was down and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard his fall. Far away in the circumferential wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little doorway looked like heaven, and he set off in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild rush for it. He did not even look around at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuers until it was gained, and he had stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the bridge, clambered a little way among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks, to the surprise and dismay of a young llama,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who went leaping out of sight, and lay down sobbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And so his coup d'etat came to an end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stayed outside the wall of the valley of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blind for two nights and days without food or</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter, and meditated upon the unexpected. Dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing these meditations he repeated very frequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">and always with a profounder note of derision the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploded proverb: "In the Country of the Blind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">One-eyed Man is King." He thought chiefly of ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fighting and conquering these people, and it grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear that for him no practicable way was possible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had no weapons, and now it would be hard to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE canker of civilisation had got to him even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bogota, and he could not find it in himself to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and assassinate a blind man. Of course, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did that, he might then dictate terms on the threat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">assassinating them all. But--sooner or later he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep! . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He tried also to find food among the pine trees, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be comfortable under pine boughs while the frost fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night, and--with less confidence--to catch a llama</seg><seg type="columnLine">by artifice in order to try to kill it--perhaps by ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mering it with a stone--and so finally, perhaps, to eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of it. But the llamas had a doubt of him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded him with distrustful brown eyes, and spat</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he drew near. Fear came on him the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">day and fits of shivering. Finally he crawled down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall of the Country of the Blind and tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make terms. He crawled along by the stream, shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, until two blind men came out to the gate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was mad," he said. "But I was only newly</seg><seg type="columnLine">made."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They said that was better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told them he was wiser now, and repented of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all he had done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he wept without intention, for he was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak and ill now, and they took that as a favourable</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They asked him if he still thought he could "see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he said. "That was folly. The world means</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing--less than nothing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They asked him what was overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About ten times ten the height of a man there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a roof above the world--of rock--and very, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE COUNTRY OF THE BLIND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">857</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth." . . . He burst again into hysterical tears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Before you ask me any more, give me some food</seg><seg type="columnLine">or I shall die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He expected dire punishments, but these blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">people were capable of toleration. They regarded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebellion as but one more proof of his general idiocy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inferiority; and after they had whipped him they</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointed him to do the simplest and heaviest work</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had for any one to do, and he, seeing no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of living, did submissively what he was told.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was ill for some days, and they nursed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindly. That refined his submission. But they in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted on his lying in the dark, and that was a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">miser)-. And blind philosophers came and talked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him of the wicked levity of his mind, and reproved</seg><seg type="columnLine">him so impressively for his doubts about the lid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock that covered their cosmic casserole that he al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most doubted whether indeed he was not the victim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hallucination in not seeing it overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Nunez became a citizen of the Country of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blind, and these people ceased to be a generalised</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and became individualities and familiar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, while the world beyond the mountains became</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and more remote and unreal. There was Yacob,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his master, a kindly man when not annoyed: there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Pedro, Yacob's nephew; and there was Medina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarote, who was the youngest daughter of Yacob.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was little esteemed in the world of the blind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because she had a clear-cut face, and lacked that satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fying, glossy smoothness that is the blind man's ideal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of feminine beauty; but Nunez thought her beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first, and presently the most beautiful thing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole creation. Her closed eyelids were not sunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">and red after the common way of the valley, but lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though they might open again at any moment;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she had long eyelashes, which were considered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave disfigurement. And her voice was strong, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not satisfy the acute hearing of the valley swains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So that she had no lover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a time when Nunez thought that, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">he win her, he would be resigned to live in the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all the rest of his days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He watched her; he sought opportunities of doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">her little services, and presently he found that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed him. Once at a rest-day gathering they sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">side by side in the dim starlight, and the music was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet. His hand came upon hers and he dared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasp it. Then very tenderly she returned his pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure. And one day. as they were at their meal in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness, he felt her hand very softly seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and as it chanced the fire leapt then and he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tenderness of her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sought to speak to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to her one day when she was sitting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the summer moonlight spinning. The light made her</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing of silver and mystery. He sat down at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and told her he loved her. and told her how</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful she seemed to him. He had a lover's voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke with a tender reverence that came near to</seg><seg type="columnLine">awe, and she had never before been touched by</seg><seg type="columnLine">adoration. She made him no definite answer, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clear his words pleased her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that he talked to her whenever he could take</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opportunity. The valley. became the world for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and the world beyond the mountains where men</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived in sunlight seemed no more than a fairy tale he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would some day pour into her ears. Very tentatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">and timidly he spoke to her of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sight seemed to her the most poetical of fancies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and she listened to his description of the stars and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains and her own sweet white-lit beauty as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it was a guilty indulgence. She did not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve, she could only half understand, but she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysteriously delighted, and it seemed to him that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His love lost its awe and took courage. Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie was for demanding her of Yacob and the elder's</seg><seg type="columnLine">in marriage, but she became fearful and delayed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it was one of her elder sisters who first told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yacob that Medina-sarote and Nunez were in love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was from the first very great opposition to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marriage of Nunez and Medina-sarote; not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much because they valued her as because they held</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as a being apart, an idiot, incompetent thing be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low the permissible level of a man. Her sisters op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed it bitterly as bringing discredit on them all;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and old Yacob, though he had formed a sort of liking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his clumsy, obedient serf, shook his head and said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing could not be. The young men- were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry at the idea of corrupting the race, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">went so far as to revile and strike Nunez. He struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. Then for the first time he found an advantage</seg><seg type="columnLine">in seeing, even by twilight, and after that fight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over no one was disposed to raise a hand against him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they still found his marriage impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Yacob had a tenderness for his last little</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter, and was grieved to have her weep upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, my dear, he's an idiot. He has delusions;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he can't do anything right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know," wept Medina-sarote. "But lie's better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he was. He's getting better. And he's strong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear father, and kind--stronger and kinder than any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other man in the world. And he loves me--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, I love him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OLD Yacob was greatly distressed to find her in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consolable, and, besides--what made it more</seg><seg type="columnLine">distressing--he liked Nunez for many things. So he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went and sat in the windowless council-chamber with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other elders and watched the trend of the talk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said, at the proper time, "He's better than lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. Very likely, some day, we shall find him as sane</seg><seg type="columnLine">as ourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then afterwards one of the elders, who thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply, had an idea. He was the great doctor among</seg><seg type="columnLine">these people, their medicine-man, and he had a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">philosophical and inventive mind, and the idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">curing Nunez of his peculiarities appealed to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One day when Yacob was present he returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the topic of Nunez.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have examined Bogota," he said, "and the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">is clearer to me. I think very probably he might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">cured."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is what I have always hoped," said old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yacob.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His brain is affected," said the blind doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The elders murmured assent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, what affects it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah!" said old Yacob.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This," said the doctor, answering his own ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. "Those queer things that are called the eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which exist to make an agreeable soft depression</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the face, are diseased, in the case of Bogota, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a way as to affect his brain. They are greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">distended, he has eyelashes, and his eyelids move,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and consequently his brain is in a state of constant</seg><seg type="columnLine">irritation and distraction."</seg><seg type="columnLine">858</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes?" said old Yacob.

He thought of the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey, day by day, from great Bogota to the still</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaster world beyond, through towns and villages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest and desert places, the rushing river day by</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, until its banks receded and the big steamers came</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashing by, and one had reached the sea--the limit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less sea, with its thousand islands, its thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands, and its ships seen dimly far away in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">incessant journeyings round and about that greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. And there, unpent by mountains, one saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky--the sky, not such a disc as one saw it here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but an arch of immeasurable blue, a deep of deeps</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which the circling stars were floating. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes scrutinised the great curtain of the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains with a keener inquiry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For example, if one went so, up that gully and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that chimney there, then one might come out high</seg><seg type="columnLine">among those stunted pines that ran round in a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelf and rose still higher and higher as it passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the gorge.

Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">that episode of the Automatic Apartment, I had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen Hicks--at close range, at least. For nine months</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had been daily kicking myself for having allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to talk me into fixing up another demonstration</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him--and that after the first one had resulted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">disaster. I had been dodging those people on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street myself ever since, and in my walks about town</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was in a continuous sweat lest I meet one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">face to face. Guess my feelings, then, at that man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal nerve when he appeared uninvited just as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was throwing his card into the waste basket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I sat there speechless, Hicks advanced and</seg><seg type="columnLine">proffered me a small flat package done up in fancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper and tied with red string. Mechanically, I took</seg><seg type="columnLine">that package and undid the thread. Methodically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly I unwrapped it. Hicks, in the meantime, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down in my easiest chair and gravely lit a cigar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ette. Inside the package there was a fancy box. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened it. A golden cigarette case came into view.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the middle of the cover, beautifully engraved, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye read my name "Fred C. O'Keefe." With fas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tidious care, I lifted the cover.

I am not superstitious, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was worried for a while about that combination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But finally I told myself that it was all nonsense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, I was soon too deeply interested in what</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was to see to be worrying about a silly matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dates. The Suburban National had been adding</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its floor space, and the new division was all but</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to be thrown open to the public. Part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space was made a long room parallel with the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this was faced by the usual row of some twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">or fifteen clerks' and tellers' windows. To my</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursory glance, indeed, everything looked very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">like in any ordinary bank, though I remember being</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck by the fact that the partition ran right up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ceiling and though of ornate design, was unbroken</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for the windows, and had an uncommonly</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid appearance. My attention was also arrested by</seg><seg type="columnLine">what appeared to me as an unusual number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric-light columns, also of highly ornamental</seg><seg type="columnLine">character, grouped along in front of the partition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My reflections on the reason for all this were pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently terminated when Hicks, who had espied me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I entered, came rushing up and led me to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the company. Some twenly people were present, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom I already knew about half. I braced myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a shock as I came face to face with Irvine. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shook hands with me quite amicably. So did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hicks' uncle Jeremiah, who had also been present at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inauguration of the Automatic Apartment. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly backed out as I. met Smith--he is a violent</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, you know--but even he took my proffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. It's wonderful what those cigarette cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done, I mentally reflected. This time I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised myself not to bring anyone along, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither aunt Zelinda nor aunt Eulalia were there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Dinker and his fiancee also were missing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I guess their experiences with the Automatic Apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment had been too much for their dignity. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, this lack was made up for by the company the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banker had supplied. There were two other presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dents of banks. One was Mr. Quague, a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">skinny, hungry-looking individual, who had the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of not being able to count ten. but had</seg><seg type="columnLine">on numerous occasions been known to multiply his</seg><seg type="columnLine">assets by that figure. The other was Mr. Ivragg,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was fat, coarse, wide, and an incessant talker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three skinny females to whom I was introduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved to be his wife, who was gushing about art,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his daughters, who had their father's face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mother's form, with the addition of bandy-legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">-not the best possible combination, I thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Among the remaining people, I knew Mr. Schmaltz,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief teller of the Suburban National. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was E. F. Croffitt himself, a tallish, bald-</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed man of forty-five, who wore glasses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose peculiar mincing gait contrasted strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his big feet and ungainly figure, and whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">painful attempts at an engaging smile immediately</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to mind the picture of an amiable and tender-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearted snake beaming upon its intended victim. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was here, there, and everywhere, conversing in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oily and yet rasping voice, full of pride and anticipa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. And now he addressed the company. He en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larged upon the crime situation in general and bank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holdups in particular, and at the end of his sonorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarks, introduced Hicks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Unaccustomed as I Am--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> REALLY must apologize when I address</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ft you," modestly began the inventor. "I am</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A no orator, and Mr. Croffitt has presented bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter than I could, the underlying reasons for the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vention of the Hicks Electro-Hydraulic Bank Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tector. But I wish to sketch to you the central idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the invention itself. Mr. Croffitt has referred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fruitless attempts of the police to curb rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beries. The police are doing all they can under</seg><seg type="columnLine">present conditions. But they are undermanned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore handicapped to a great extent. And a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious condition even, is the absolute failure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">courts to adequately punish those criminals whom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">often at great expense and risk of life, the police do</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprehend. When I say this, I 'am only repeating</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts with which you are all but too familiar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, what," inquired Hicks, "is the remedy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of a situation such as this?" He paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, waiting for an answer. "If the police</seg><seg type="columnLine">are unable to catch the criminals, and the courts are</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to mete out proper punishment to instill suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficient respect in the minds of those who intend to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil, then it is up to the citizens to catch the criminal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so utterly and unfailingly defeat him, that even after</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has served his term, he will remember the experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence with feelings of unalloyed and unforgettable</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hicks had raised his voice and emphasized these</seg><seg type="columnLine">last remarks, and now he stopped to take a breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">E. F. Croffitt and the other two bankers nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravely in a pleased way, and a general murmur</seg><seg type="columnLine">of assent ran through the company.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The more I thought of this idea," Hicks con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued, "the more I was taken with it. How to</seg><seg type="columnLine">defend the bank and its treasures against the holdup</seg><seg type="columnLine">man became the subject of my thoughts by day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my dreams by night. What complicated the problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that while apprehending the wrong-doer with</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfailing certainty and creating in the mind of every</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminal the feeling that the bank, instead of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fit prey for his nefarious activity, was a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be shunned like the plague, it was necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard the public and the bank employees from in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jury. For a while, I will frankly admit, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless. It would take too long to even sketch an</seg><seg type="columnLine">outline of my labors, the many false scents I fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed, as it were. Let it suffice that after a vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">expenditure of concentrated mental effort, I finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed the Hicks Electro-Hydraulic Bank Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tector, a system of bank protection totally differing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from others, a weird combination, you may think</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first blush, yet I am sure you will find it a logical</seg><seg type="columnLine">remedy. Strange diseases call for strange medicines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may wonder, for instance, at the idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydraulics, of water under pressure, for a purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as this. At first it seems odd. But let us con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider for a moment. When there is a riot, and it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems hopeless, when the police, with night sticks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">HICKS' INVENTIONS WITH A KICK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">863</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">revolvers, are unable to cope with the situation, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unreasoning mob is no longer deterred by fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death and injury, then who is called in? Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Fire Department!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Hicks made this pronouncement, a pleased hum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of approbation could be heard. The idea had struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When the inmates of a jail or a madhouse grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebellious and raise pandemonium in their cells day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and night, and no punitive measures seem to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect, when isolation, starvation, straightjackets are</seg><seg type="columnLine">of no use, then what is?" Hicks continued, and an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swering his own question: "Why, water, streams</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cold water, big cold streams under high pressure..</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as the water hose is brought in, the fight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the riot, ends. No fight has ever been known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">last one minute after the fire hose began to play on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fighters. Men will fight in a hail of bullets, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will brave death from bombs and grenades, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will keep on fighting after they are bleeding from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen wounds. But turn a big, powerful stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cold water on them, and the most ferocious fighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">quits."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I use electricity to bring about that sudden re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lease of the water that is necessary to obtain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired effect. However, it also operates the armor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate shutter I have provided for each window. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of so protecting the tellers' windows is not new.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It has been tried out, but, for one reason or another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">has met with only partial success. One of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious troubles is that, in his rage and disappoint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, the hold-up man is apt to run amuck and kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">people at random. Such a system, therefore, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes positively dangerous. Yet, combined with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper complementary idea it makes a splendid de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vice. I will show you how I found this combination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 beg your pardon for a moment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Number nine down, Daniels," Hicks called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a flash, our view through the window in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which we were assembled, into the interior of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banking room, was shut off.

But first and foremost, we want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">defend ourselves against him. In these days of gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">banditry, we must be prepared for a condition where</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or two of a company of robbers undertake the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold-up, and other members stand ready to start a</seg><seg type="columnLine">general attack if things do not go as intended. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tellers' windows, of course, present the only profit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able point of attack. The modern bank bandit is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate and quick-witted individual. Seeing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">comrade foiled by the shutter, other members might,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instance, place an explosive against some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows.

In the meantime, let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us reason out just what will take place. The water</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be deflected by the surface of the shutter. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">that surface is divided up into a number of concave</seg><seg type="columnLine">surfaces having their foci placed at a variety of</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly different angles, the four-inch stream, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided into two dozen smaller streams, will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown back with tremendous force from the shutter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">right in the face of the attacker,--a blinding, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">escapable, elemental rush of water against which</seg><seg type="columnLine">there can be no thought,of fight,--in the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which resistance becomes a mere ridiculous fantasy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and action of any kind, whether concerted or not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a preposterous joke."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Why Smith Got Scared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS the inventor paused to wipe the perspiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his face, it was clear that Hicks' logic</seg><seg type="columnLine">. vvas hitting the mark. The whole thing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a! first seemed odd, but now it turned out to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful piece of reasoning.

Come on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith did not reply. Whether my argument or</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of being thought afraid changed his mind, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know, but he stayed. He was uneasy, though.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meanwhile this conversation had lost me a part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hicks' speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wonderful Reasoning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     TALVE practically hidden in the top of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">\/ column, and designed to throw the water at</seg><seg type="columnLine">j an angle of forty-five degrees to the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface, the water being actually deflected, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a general horizontal direction and straight out, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason of the inclination of the concavities in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutter to which I referred. While the stream as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">issues from the nozzle will therefore miss the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the person standing in front, his face and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire upper portion of his body will be the target</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rebounding water at a distance of two feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But even six feet away, though spread out wider, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of the spray will still be so great that it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be impossible for any human being to hold his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may wonder why I first direct the stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the window. It might seem more practical</seg><seg type="columnLine">and simple to direct a number of streams from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window against the intruder. But that would com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicate matters instead of simplifying them. Instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one valve I would need at least a dozen, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would have to be built in around the window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can see some of the complications already. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, while such a system would ward off the bandit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would still be incomplete protection.

After</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, as you see, the indirect way here proves the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the simplest way out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HICKS smiled a little as he noticed how his neat</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of reasoning was being appreciated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his audience. Remarks such as "sure is good," "won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful fellow," "Isn't he just fine"--this from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women--more or less subdued, were to be heard on</seg><seg type="columnLine">every side. You can bet that I shared in the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciation. Only Smith seemed aloof, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullen and worried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A general switchboard," resumed the inventor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"back in the tellers' room, and which you can see</seg><seg type="columnLine">through these windows in the inner banking room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes care of all electrical controls. It is now ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to allow final adjustments to be made, but later</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will be covered by a box and locked to prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">untoward happenings. One of the controls on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">board is for the operation of the shutter, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">action of which results the opening of the overhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">valve. But what I have so far pointed out to you is</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the first line of defense. You will remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we do not merely want to scare the holdup man</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, but that we want to apprehend him--we want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to utterly confound him, all along the line. And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">we come to the piece de resistance of the Hicks</seg><seg type="columnLine">Electro-Hydraulic Bank Protector, namely, the Hy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">draulo-Centrifugal Rotating System. It is here that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the punitive features of my invention come in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With Hicks pointing out things I quickly began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see system in the arrangement of the columns. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were four grouped in front of each teller's window</seg><seg type="columnLine">to form a square having sides of about two feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half,--all four meeting in graceful gothic curves</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead, where they were topped by a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluster of lights. Two of the columns were within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few inches from the partition, and, in fact, ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the counter, the other pair being set out</seg><seg type="columnLine">further into the room. In the left hand one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">'these there was located the four-inch nozzle. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">centered between them on the floor, there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised circular step, about eighteen inches in diameter</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon which anybody would have to stand in talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the teller. I had paid no particular attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Some Technical Data</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hf | M-IIS round step," Hicks said, "is in reality</seg><seg type="columnLine">I a revolvable platform. I say revolvable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">JL not revolving, because ordinarily, it is fixed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as soon as the shutter has dropped, it is free</seg><seg type="columnLine">to revolve. You have already seen that one of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns is really a standpipe. I want to add that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remainder are the same. And as you see here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each one of them has, at a height of from three</seg><seg type="columnLine">to five feet, and under the guise of ornamental ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crescences, a row of three short nozzles with a two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch opening, Now, if you'll look closely," continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hicks, "you will notice that these nozzles are pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a direction that would be about tangent to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of the person standing on the platform. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is the idea here?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Suppose we were to direct four tangent streams</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the round platform on which the person stands,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued the inventor, "what would happen ? Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would revolve--it would start to spin at a speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which the ratio would be determined by the diam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eter of the platform, the area of contact, the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the water stream, and the frictional coefficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the water and the peripheral surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!" I cried. "Go on!" Some of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany turned round and looked at me, but I simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't help it, I am gone on that stuff. Some day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I have time, I'll take a course in engineering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Hicks looked around him, pleased, and continued:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So, when we apply the four triple two-inch streams,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each under two hundred pound pressure per square</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch, to the body of a person standing on a platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">HICKS' INVENTIONS WITH A KICK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">865</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--mounted, I will add, on roller bearings--and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we consider that the muzzle velocity of the stream is</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximately 173 feet per second, and figure the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean diameter of the average person, the frictional</seg><seg type="columnLine">area presented by the clothing, and the coefficient of</seg><seg type="columnLine">friction of the clothing and water. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!" I broke in. "Good!

Inwardly 1 swore he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have one of those two bottles of Hennessy Five Star</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had at home. As for the company, they were hum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming with remarks. President Croffitt wore a broad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard smile on his face. The other two presidents</seg><seg type="columnLine">were whispering in that impressive way that bankers</seg><seg type="columnLine">have.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What Happens to the Robber</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"AT OW," resumed Hicks, "picture the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> |Xj The hold-up man enters. He steps on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">.jL. 1 platform--there is no other choice. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">teller suddenly looks into the muzzle of a gun. 'Slip</seg><seg type="columnLine">me five thou', or you're dead,' is the demand. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">teller steps on the button. There is a crash--all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shutters in the room are down. Perhaps the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burglar shoots--no matter, the shutter can stand it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it would be his last vicious act, for within three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenths of a second after the shutter is down, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve valves open simultaneously. The water is</seg><seg type="columnLine">under 200 lbs. pressure. Escape is impossible--you</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot cross such a stream ten feet away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nozzle, and here it is only two. At the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first second, the robber is spinning around at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of one hundred and twenty revolutions per min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute. After one hundred revolutions, however, or in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, seventeen seconds, the water is shut off. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't want to kill him, you know. Dazed, uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious, he collapses on the floor. Meanwhile the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining tellers' windows have automatically been</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed. The rotating system is here inactive, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous sprays of water from the first line de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fense are playing into the room. Some of the cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomers, of course, will get a scare, and all of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">will get a wetting, but that is a matter of trivial</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment compared to the fact that the attack is foiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a decisive setback given to future nefarious</seg><seg type="columnLine">schemes. As for the robber, he is beyond escaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his own effort. There is still one possibility--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be carried out by accomplices. But even this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his last ray of salvation, is annihilated by the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crowning feature of the Hicks Electro-Hydraulic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bank Protector--the Adhesive Reaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you will look overhead"--we all did and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time T noticed, in the ceiling above us, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like a semi-spherical metal ornament about</seg><seg type="columnLine">two feet in diameter--"you will see, corresponding</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the row of tellers' windows, and exactly above</seg><seg type="columnLine">each platform, a corresponding row of my patented</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adhesive Droppers.

When closed, each bowl contains--you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be surprised to hear it--one hundred pounds of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongest adhesive known,--Le Page's Liquid Glue."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">• There was no question that this was indeed a sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise. Some one laughed. Banker Croffitt smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hard, pleased smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It might look like a humorous touch," said Hicks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">also, smiling, "but it is, in fact, from the standpoint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bank, the needed final link of protection, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the point of view of the gangster, the final link</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the chain that will bind his wrists. The glue is</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained in an envelope of celluloid so thin that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will just suffice to keep it togther so long as it is in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bowl of the dropper, but instantly bursts into</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments when the ball is dropped.

Before he can even raise</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, or to be exact, in two and a quarter seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the rotating streams have been shut off, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowl opens and a solid ball of glue, two feet across,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and weighing one hundred pounds, drops from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of twelve feet. The effect, I need hardly say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is final, insofar as escape is concerned. Did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, in fastening things together, get a little glue on</seg><seg type="columnLine">your fingers and then try to do anything? If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">did, then you have some faint idea of what a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">can do, or what can be done with him, after one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred pounds of liquid glue have been dropped all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Case of Cold Feet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a few moments there was silence, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then there was clapping of hands, led by</seg><seg type="columnLine">E.

Everybody crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him and the inventor, congratulating one</seg><seg type="columnLine">or both, asking questions, expressing admiration.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only Smith stood aside, with a scowl on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, man, what is biting you now ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His wife had overheard us, for she chimed in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are going, Billy?

There was a little jerk and the shutter</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved, as if it were trying, but it did not come</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. And then with a hiss, with the suddenness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and force of an explosion, a mighty stream of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued from the overhead nozzle and struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter just in front of Schmaltz. It was all so</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick that I noticed Schmaltz was still smiling when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deflected stream, now flattened, hit him right</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the chin. Even in that tiny fraction of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second the thought shot across my brain that Hicks</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said he would give a convincing demonstration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the inconceivable power of such a stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water,--and here it was. The next moment the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounding stream had lifted the unfortunate teller</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air. A doubled-up ball of humanity, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning a rearward somersault over a table right</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him. One, two, three, four turns, executed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fantastic rapidity; the broadening stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water playing on the periphery of the human ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was Schmaltz and accelerating his rotation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then abruptly, he landed, sitting down, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sliding motion, on the switchboard. The last</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I remember seeing were miscellaneous pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bottom of his pants adhering to various levers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other protuberances on the switchboard. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">became of him from that moment on I do not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member, for I was busy elsewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even before any of the women had time to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent to a shriek, the inventor's despairing yell re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded through the room, piercing the crash of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbling body and the roar of the water:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The switchboard--God help us--must get at it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors locked!" And with incredible speed he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the nearest window--the shutters had all re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained open and the whole thing was evidently out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gear, for nothing was happening the way it should.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even as I wondered at Hicks' presence of mind, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that Smith was also about to climb through</seg><seg type="columnLine">another window, and I distinctly recall in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment regretting that I had ever thought him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coward, for here he was one of the only two men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">action in the crowd--the others were paralyzed. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Hydraulic Rotating System in Action</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL this happened in a fraction of a second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As I have observed before, in emergencies</seg><seg type="columnLine">w the human mind works with lightning speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As Hicks was lifting one knee to get into the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow, I heard a distinct loud "click," and at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I saw ten thousand stars and found myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting twelve feet away on the floor, yet on some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing remarkably soft. I distinctly recall noticing</seg><seg type="columnLine">this detail. And then I noticed that I was getting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hit at rapid intervals and that I was wet, and getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">wetter. I had hardly had time to associate these</seg><seg type="columnLine">various facts with the tangential streams from Hicks'</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, when my dazed senses were stung into</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide-awakeness by the spectacle which now pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented itself to my one good eye. Of Hicks nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be seen, but there was a tall column of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was whirling around with incredible rapidity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from which at frequent irregular intervals there</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued offshoots in the form of mighty spurts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water in four directions. Simultaneously, a roar as</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a high-power turbine, punctuated by staccato</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashes as the branching streams hit something or</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody, was to be heard. The room all over was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one mass of horizontal geysers and everybody present</seg><seg type="columnLine">was floored, some of the company lying in heaps over</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other and crawling about in their misery from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one place to another, only to get into worse trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I only noticed these things by the way, for my hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rified gaze was riveted on the upright whirling mael-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strom, which I knew contained Hicks. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, I remembered that Smith behind me had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to get through a window too, and turning half</seg><seg type="columnLine">around on where I sat--I was quite unconscious that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was sitting on Mrs. Kragg, and as I afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized, was merely feeling an undercurrent of irri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation at the shrieks of agony proceeding from under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath--I saw another whirling waterspout a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet away, with a dark core which I knew to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith. "Poor, heroic fellow," I remember saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to myself, and then one of the tangential streams</seg><seg type="columnLine">branched off and hit me on the ear so hard that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was knocked off my perch. "And 1 was the one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">urged him to stay!" I thought as I turned over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled off. A little shiver ran down my spine--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not due to the water. I say there is nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the human mind--strangest thing in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHAT I have related so far took place probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">in no more than four seconds. The surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack had been so sudden and so fierce that only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few screams, for the most part quickly muffled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce darts of water, had been heard. But long</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the two unfortunates ceased their involuntary</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad-dervish whirl, shrieks, curses, maledictions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice to get out, orders to do this or that, demands</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop it, filled the air. Somebody had crawled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door and tried it. I knew it was no use--Hicks</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said it was locked--it had been his last remark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Logical too--part of the scheme. I knew we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught, even as I \yas ineffectually trying to dodge</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fierce intermittent shots of water that were assail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me from two sides. It had just dawned on me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I might slightly better my situation by crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">elsewhere, when I suddenly noted that the streams</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ceased. Instantly the thobght flashed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">my brain that a hundred revolutions had been com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted--part of Hicks' system was working, anyway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My head was turned in the inventor's direction, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as I was looking, the envelope of water sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly dropped from him, and Hicks, no longer sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained by the tremendous gyratory force of the vor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tex, collapsed between the four columns, a wet, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed mass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard a piercing scream behind me and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">round. Mrs. Smith was draping her wet but opulent</seg><seg type="columnLine">form over the prostrate body of her husband, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dazedly trying to raise his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HICKS' INVENTIONS WITH A KICK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">867</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, my poor, curly-headed baby!" Mrs. Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">was saying, in a pitiable tone, as she put her arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenderly around her husband's neck. It's funny</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I am built, but even half-dazed though I was, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that that appellation was not altogether correct,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Smith is bald, forty years old, and weighs over</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred pounds. This didn't seem to matter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Smith, though.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Power of Glue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">my poor, little curly-headed boy!" she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 1 was saying for the second time. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . ." She got no further. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush as of something soft and heavy. A dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy form swept by, there was a dull, heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">"sap!" and Mrs. Smith seemed to crumple upon her</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband, while her head and shoulders were blotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out by a greenish mass about two feet in diameter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was one of the Adhesive Reactions--I knew it</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help! I . . . gob . . . gob . . . gob ..." I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to see whence the new cry of alarm issued</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw Hicks, who had managed to sit upright,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking like a humorous sketch of a deep-sea diver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His head appeared six times its natural size, envel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oped as it was in a hundred-pound gob of liquid ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesive. In that moment I knew what he had meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he talked of the psychological effect of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--it was awful. And yet I knew only the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> E. F. Croffitt sprang to the aid of Mrs. Smith.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All bankers are chivalrous. He could not make her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear, for the adhesive had enveloped her. entire head</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a coat an inch thick and was slowly spreading in</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy greenish streams down over her body or drip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping off, here and there, in big drops,--but he sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands with his and succeeded in raising her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just then Mrs. Smith blew an opening through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat of glue over her mouth. A blood-curdling shriek</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent the air, as she fell around Croffitt's neck. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">banker tried to get away, but there was no getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Instead the lady drew him closer and closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her bosom, blindly seeking protection, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">she knew there was human flesh. It was in vain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Croffitt exerted his utmost strength to escape the</seg><seg type="columnLine">viscous embrace. His struggles only got him mixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up more, and it was not long before he was smeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with glue from head to foot. The adhesive by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time had worked down on both their garments and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all over their shoes. The two, Mrs. Smith hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the banker in a tight embrace, were executing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange two-step on the mosaic. Their shoes got</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck on the floor by the heavy, sticky mass that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">running off them, and this made their efforts increas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly more frantic. Under Croffitt's superhuman</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggles to wrench his feet free, first one Oxford,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the other, followed by both his socks, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained adhering to the floor. As they stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about in their weird and sticky dance, they backed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the inventor, who had made a breathing hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his glue mask by swallowing a quart or so and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in trying to claw some of the stuff off his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and neck, had enveloped his hands in sticky gobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight inches in diameter. Under the impact, he now</seg><seg type="columnLine">put these out blindly and closed them from behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the banker's face. Croffitt's roar of rage at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">new injury shook the ceiling, but was almost instantly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stifled, as a big gob got lodged in his mouth. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed hard-down it went.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Schmaltz Does His Bit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE I was watching this new develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment with a sort of nightmare interest, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized subconsciously that all this time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundering of water had not ceased. I turned my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the partition and instantly I knew the reason.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was only the tangential streams that would cease</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the end of seventeen seconds--the four-inch line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of defense was going full force, but as the shutters</seg><seg type="columnLine">had refused to act, they were blazing away through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the windows into the interior banking room. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become of Schmaltz? The question struck me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sickening mental thud. Had he been killed?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was he drowned ? I raised myself and looked cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise through one of the windows. Fifteen enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">streams were playing against the opposite wall, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they were rebounding with a frightful roar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A subdued, powerful hum, I noticed now, was shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the room--the noise caused by the tremendously</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast travel of the water through the pipes. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">where was Schmaltz ? There, in the midst of a boil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing water volcano issuing from the opposite wall, up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his waist in water, he was,--I saw a head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms. He was alive! He was doing something, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">--fumbling with the switchboard. Good! Fine!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I almost cried to know that he had not been killed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And just then another thought struck me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">annihilating force. The switchboard! Let him fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it and only the Almighty knew what would</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen next!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up! Get out! Leave it alone!" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed. He did not hear. The noise was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. But I shouted again. I gesticulated. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not see. I turned round in despair. Kragg was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing near me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got to get him to leave that switchboard alone,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I yelled,--"he'll raise the devil if he don't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kragg proved a man of action. "Let's both yell</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him--he may hear that"--he roared at me, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went as near the window to me as the oblique stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">from above would let him. "Now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1LET out my yell--but got only half through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Beneath the roar of waters, I heard a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">click. There was a black flash, and I would in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly have known that the shutter was down, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the tremendous spray of the recoiling water which</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely missed me, had not apprised me of the fact.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The realization that I had escaped came simultane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously with the knowledge that Kragg had not. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have had his head right in line with the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounding spray. There was an explosion of water as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boundless hydraulic force made contact with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. This lasted but the hundredth part of a second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however. Then Kragg, head backwards, with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceivable speed and the force of a battering ram,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shot out into the room. With a sickening thud,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head bored itself into Irvine's stomach--he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been standing right in line. Irvine shut up like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jack-knife, and the combined bulk of the two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed on Quague. The sigh of the escaping air</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the little banker as the three hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty pounds abruptly sat on his stomach, could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard even through the thundering and hissing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">868</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elsewhere in the room, the water was raising in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">describable havoc. After the first baptism had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended, most of the people had instinctively backed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall opposite the partition, in their desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get as far away as possible from the source of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those tangential torrents. They now, however, found</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves in the very worst place, for by the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four-inch streams had gone nearly across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room they had spread enough so that the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanse of the opposite wall was, to use a para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doxical expression, under fire--the remainder of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room being under water anyway--which was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">two feet deep. Under the relentless play of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty fountains nobody was able to keep his ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some, on their hands and knees, were crawling out</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the partition again, others were crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their faces against the wall. Hats, sticks, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloves, ladies' handbags and other articles were float-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around in the boiling sea. I was one of the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had remained near the partition and was there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore comparatively comfortable, for I was merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting in water up to my chest. I was still, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazed and detached way, admiring the strange effects</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced by the mighty spray playing upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kragg-Irvine-Quague trio and wondering about their</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming inability to get disentangled from each other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when abruptly the streams ceased flowing and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of the waters ended. The stillness which fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed, by comparison, seemed like the stillness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Field of Battle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HERE and there, half-crazed human beings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">women with their dresses sticking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, men with wilted collars and clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which the water was running in rivers, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising themselves from the deluge. The fierce tune</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the water discharge was replaced by a tune in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new key. Women wept and sobbed. Men cursed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as yet weakly, but as if they meant it. As reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to return, ominous glances were focused in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of Hicks. So far as he was concerned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water display had been a benefit, as it had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Smith and Croffitt, by washing some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glue off them. Smith himself was propped up</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall. His face was pale, but his glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ferocious, and it was bent upon me. I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gretted to see how quickly he was recovering. Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith's face was clean, but her hair was a solid mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of adhesive. Croffitt had risen. He had a thick wad</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his neck and ears, and his entire front elevation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still besmeared with the stuff. As he stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this array, minus shoes and stockings, I decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not make a very impressive figure. But his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at Hicks was absolutely frightful. The water</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rapidly draining off--that part of the system</seg><seg type="columnLine">was working, anyway. With my mind still in a reel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I dully, vaguely wondered what would happen when</seg><seg type="columnLine">those people really woke up. And then the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed through my mind that after all, we--this</seg><seg type="columnLine">company--were the best proof of the efficiency of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hicks Protective System. How could robbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold up a bank such as this?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Little Surprise</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was a pounding at the door. "Help</seg><seg type="columnLine">is coming!" cried Mrs. ICragg, jubilantly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We are rescued!"--A fool remark--what</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the devil did we need rescuing for, anyway. All</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we had to do was to walk out. I might even slip</seg><seg type="columnLine">out--ahead of Smith. I felt better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door opened. Four men entered. They closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it behind them. I was surprised to note how care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully they closed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The four men advanced. At first blush, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescuers did not look inspiring. Two were little</seg><seg type="columnLine">skinny, ferrety-looking individuals with hard, shifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and harder mouths. The third was a brutal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking, heavy-set young man who chewed a quid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the last man who entered, a lank, hatchet-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual, had a positively evil look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold up yer hands an' line up agin de wall, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">yer don't wanna be killed," ordered the lank indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidual. And he jerked out a big pistol, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved in our general direction. "Now don't make</seg><seg type="columnLine">no noise. Shoot de foist guy wot makes a wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">move, Butch," he said casually to the heavy-set man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure will, Jake," replied that worthy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now go t'rough deir clothes, yer two," ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leader, for none less was the lank man. At this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two ferrety-looking yeggs started a business-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">survey of our clothing. They worked fast, yet took</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to be thorough, and it was surprising to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much they collected. Watches, rings, bracelets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewelry worth thousands of dollars, were stripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us in a few moments, and this was joined by</seg><seg type="columnLine">an equally large sum in cash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, ole Baldy," the leader disrespectfully ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed E.

"I's jes' a-achin' ter do it, Jake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' it ain't gonna make no noise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get busy sudden or yer'r dead," snapped Jake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shoved the muzzle of the big pistol right under</seg><seg type="columnLine">Croffitt's nose. The banker's face grew ashen. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will," he whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the two rat-faced men held the rest of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">at bay with drawn revolvers, Jake and Butch entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner room. I could see, from the point where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was standing, how with trembling hands, E. F.</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked the combination. He stepped back, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Butch by him, pistol pressed to his side.

If Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentiroso traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from west to east at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1.000	miles per hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was free from all</seg><seg type="columnLine">frictional resistance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the attraction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitation he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain approximately</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the same spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the earth in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely as the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be traveling at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same speed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">space; and without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance of the atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere or gravitational</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull he would be left</seg><seg type="columnLine">far behind unless he were traveling eastward at 1,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per hour. If he reversed his direction and headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">west at 1,000 miles per hour (being of course free</seg><seg type="columnLine">from gravitational pull and atmospheric resistance)</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be passing the surface of the earth at 2,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per hour although still traveling about the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">axis at 1,000 miles per hour. Hence he would make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete circuit (although in an opposite direction)</seg><seg type="columnLine">every 24 hours, so that the sun (to him) would rise in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the west and set in the east and his days would be 24</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours long. He would arrive back at his starting point</seg><seg type="columnLine">24 hours later, with his time agreeing with the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">time at that point. If he traveled at a speed of say</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">24.000	miles per hour it would not affect the earth's time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but would merely result in each of his days being one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour long, or in other words, the sun to him would rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">and set every hour. As all our time is based upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's rotation and orbit, Doctor Mentiroso's time (if</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling faster than the earth and free from its atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pheric envelope) would have no real connection with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IF TRAVELING EAST TO WEST AT 1000 rtPR IF TRAVELING EAST TO WEST AT 2000 M.P.H</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  earth time. It would In fact be similar to time upon a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  distant planet. Theoretically, he would of course, return</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  to his starting point before he left it, provided he went</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  by earth time; but just as soon as he begins traveling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  about the earth's axis faster than the earth itself, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  produces his own individual time. In other words, if his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  days were one hour long (when traveling at 24,000 miles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  per hour) according to our conception of an hour which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  is one twenty-fourth of the period between sunrise and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  sunrise, then his hours would be one twenty-fourth of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  an earth hour and his speed based on that would be only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  1,000 miles per his hour. The whole question is one of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  relativity, and regardless of what speed he attained, his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  time in relation to earth time would remain constant, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  the instant he set foot on earth he would find that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  time was precisely what it would have been had he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  traveled about the earth's axis at 1,000 miles per hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The accompanying diagrams will perhaps make this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  clearer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNDERSEA EXPRESS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">By J.

C. sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tsibles, yet never until this day had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to adjust my business and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler affairs so as to arrange the trip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were compensations in this, however, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">patents of the International Express Company had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lately expired, making it possible for me to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newer developments which had placed the Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany's vessels so far ahead of the many other sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine ships that unloaded their cargoes from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-filled labyrinth beneath the city streets. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Babbington, Vice President of the Company, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been kindness personified. He had arranged for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see everything. Yet, as we waited for a sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the scheduled ship, each succeeding minute served</seg><seg type="columnLine">to increase my impatience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour of this and I was decidedly ill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lnimored. I glared about the little subterranean</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, noticing for the tenth time, the small elevator</seg><seg type="columnLine">which nestled in the corner ready to lift us to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">level of old Broadway 300 feet overhead. I stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">balefully at the pale little man who sat before a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small switchboard fingering a row of push-buttons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 felt like clutching his throat, not because he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cause of the submersible's lateness, but because</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was angry and he was anemic and miserahle-look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. My eyes wandered to the channel side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber, an immense wall of thick, though trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent glass, the size of a show-window, whose pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tecting bars of steel reminded me of the prisons used</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the days of our forefathers. Then, as I gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the green liquid on the far side of the glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was conscious that my friend, Mr. Babbington,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had touched the operator at the switchboard. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I thought the latter had turned on another</seg><seg type="columnLine">big lamp, which was filling the channel with light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as I looked, the glare came nearer, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden pumping of my heart, I knew that my ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The giant cigar-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel nosed her way</seg><seg type="columnLine">along and as the forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of her length</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped by, I saw the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain at the bridge, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembled a small bay-win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow. He waved a hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Babbington, whom I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard muttering about Fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Fortune and the mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etary value of the forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five minutes which the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mersible had lost. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as I read the large</seg><seg type="columnLine">white letters upon her hull,</seg><seg type="columnLine">signifying that she was the International Express</seg><seg type="columnLine">Company Ship Number 352 of New York City, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a stop with a gentle tremor- against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bumper side-clips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A second later the pale operator pushed one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his buttons and as my eyes followed the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his, T saw a huge vertical cylinder cleaving the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its descent upon the waiting submarine . . . There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a mild clash of steel on steel and then, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">another button felt the anemic finger of the operator,</seg><seg type="columnLine">six metal arms swung out from the cylinder, lock-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ing themselves firmly to as many thistle-keys. Simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously, a current of bubbling water began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream from a series of electro-hinged ports extend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around the base of the big tube. This, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased in a few seconds, whereupon a light flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on above the switchboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on," cricd Mr. Babbington. "That's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal--the water is ejected from the cylinder. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">352 will open her hatches and loading will begin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I	followed him into the elevator which whisked us</seg><seg type="columnLine">up 265 feet to the loading room where the clang</seg><seg type="columnLine">and din of New York's busy streets were wafted</seg><seg type="columnLine">down through the ventilators. These noises were as</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoes of the sounds which should have issued from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this room of arriving crates and departing boxes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But from the room itself there were no loud noises,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no clashing of heavy articles, no shouting, no rattling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trucks. I noticed piles of packages and crates de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posited gently on the floor by compressed air chutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading from the checking room on the street level.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each pile was labeled according to its destination--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seattle, San Francisco, London. Paris, Singapore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peking, etc. The shipments for Chicago and Seattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at the moment being gathered up by powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">little gas-reciprocating cranes and dumped on large</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift platforms which carried them up through the ceil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Mr. Babbington nodded toward the ascending</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes. "To the Air Liners," he said. "Elevators go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to landing towers on the roof."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE arrived at the tubular shafts leading to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">channel in time to see my baggage disappear</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the depths.

We looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up quickly as the elevated bow of the Bristol came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down opposite our windows. The sight seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">freeze Judson to immobility, one hand on the depth</seg><seg type="columnLine">valve key, the other on the throttle. While he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched during that breathless moment, the Bristol</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovered on an even keel and then with a quick lurch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her bow settled and the long, black hull plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward. At the same moment a claxon sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">discordantly and I was knocked to the floor by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantaneous jump of our ship as Judson opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide the throttle. But we were safe from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous suction and we had saved our man--</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched him from the jaws of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nervous tension over, Captain Judson swore</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly at the loss of our lead gangplank which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been torn from its runners by our sudden forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurch for freedom. Except for this slight outbreak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, everyone went about his work quietly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Larkin took the bridge and began the long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradual ascent to our cruising depth, I turned to seek</seg><seg type="columnLine">my stateroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must have slept heavily, for when my first meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finished, I saw the noon shift walking aft</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the engine room. I hurriedly walked in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite direction, mentally framing an excuse for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my laziness; but when I reached the bridge, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a soul in sight. To say I was puzzled would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly describe my sensation, but as I pondered this</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar situation, the truth dawned upon me--we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on the surface. That continuous sheet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water beating against the glass was our bow spray;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bright light was the glorious sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I raced for the companionway leading to the after</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck and stumbled up the steps.

"We're making 130 knots now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indeed, every appearance supported the truth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter assertion. Although the sea was smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the swell was hardly discernible, the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward portion of our deck was awash in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of foam displaced by our piercing bows. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, whistling through the surface gear, burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">into my eyes and tugged at my clothing. Yes, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were indeed speeding and I wondered if our artificial</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind was much less than that created by the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">airship which passed over us just then, some 6000</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in the clouds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">My reflections were cut short, however, bv the</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Continued on page 877)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">CRYSTALS OF GROWTH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Bv Charles H TZector</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. . . . then a shudder passed over his frame and before my eyes he commenced to increase in size . . . here before my eyes, growth was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taking placc immediately.

As I became older, this liking lor</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious things developed into a study and inves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tigation of matters dealing with the psychic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">occult.

I refer to Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Brontley and his theory of rapid growth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Early last spring I became acquainted with the prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inent teacher and writer, James H. Brontley, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable achievements in the field of biological</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemistry have won for him a wide-spread and well</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserved prominence. Professor Brontley and 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">became fast friends and I considered myself forr</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunate to have the opportunity of knowing him so</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. We would often sit for hours and converse</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon subjects of common interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One evening 1 sat in my chair musing before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable fire; I had just finished my dinner and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was resting quietly thinking of the latest accomplish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of my friend Brontley. He had confided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a short time previously that he was experiment-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon a subject which, if successfully attained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would secure not only personal fame for him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a wonderful benefit to mankind. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me nothing of the nature of the experiment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was thinking of this particular thing, wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he would have something definite to say to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. when the door was suddenly opened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very person about whom I had been thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into the room and dropped down in a chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">near me. He looked exultant and excited and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shook my hand he burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">out:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jameson, I've found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last and I have come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell you about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at him in sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise.

The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">changes which take place are rather complex, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">just at present are not of primary importance to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject which I wish to disclose to you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you are well aware," he continued, "different</seg><seg type="columnLine">foods affect the body in various ways. Some foods</seg><seg type="columnLine">are more efficient than others; we speak of this rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive digestive value of foods as the 'coefficient of di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestibility' which means, in simple terms, that a larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">percentage of some foods are digested than of others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some animals can utilize more fiber than others can,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some can make better use of the protein than</seg><seg type="columnLine">others.

Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brontley motioned to me to follow him and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment we were ascending the stairs which led, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I assumed, to his laboratory above. I had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in his laboratory before and consequently I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was exceedingly anxious to see the place where all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his wonderful discoveries had been made. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">chummy as we were, I had never had the oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity of seeing the interior of this place, probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of his desire for secrecy in regard to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress of certain tests which he was making. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">any rate, I knew that it was an important experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would cause him to invite me inside of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work-shop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally we reached the third story of the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stopped for a moment before a door which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">securely locked. Evidently the Professor was tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing precautions against unexpected visitors to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular room while he was away. He drew a</seg><seg type="columnLine">string of keys from his pocket and after unlocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door he pushed a button in the wall and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place was flooded with light. I followed him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room and looked around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an ordinary chemical laboratory, such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had seen many times before, containing various</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorts of apparatus which one usually finds in a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that kind. The shelves along the side were</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with bottles of different colored liquids and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long table in the middle of the room was covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with racks of test-tubes, Bunsen burners, beakers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">retorts, flasks and other laboratory materials. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend told me to seat myself and observe closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything that he did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1WILL attempt to narrate as accurately as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible everything which took place in the labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory that night. After putting on a rubber apron,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend placed a pair of ordinary motor goggles</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his eyes. He then took a large flask from die</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelf, examined it closely and placed it on a tripod.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Following this act, he removed from a rack before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, five different colored liquids. From each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these he measured an equal portion, and poured it</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the large flask upon the tripod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These five liquids represent a preparation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">five most essential substances in our food," he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained; he added nothing further and I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">press him for additional details.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next thing he did was to light the gas be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the tripod and standing a short distance away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he watched with suspense the mixture within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flask. For a short time there was no apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">change, and then as the contents became warmer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a hissing sound accompanied presently bv</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crackling and snapping not unlike the snapping of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wood fire. The mixture was now boiling. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">light curl of fumes issued from the neck of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flask and there was a slightly pungent, but not un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant odor noticeable in the room. The Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed it to boil for possibly two minutes and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned off the gas. He stirred it slowly and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">dipped a piece of blue litmus paper into the flask;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paper turned red, showing that there was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">acid reaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now for the last step," announced my friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and added a few drops of a light blue substance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from a bottle near by. There was a sharp report</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a pistol shot and a shower of yellowish-brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystals fell upon a tray beneath the tripod. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend carefully collected these crystals and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning to me he stated in an elated tone:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is finished as I had planned, and upon these</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystals in my hand depends the success of my ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment. You have witnessed a test of synthetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">or artificial digestion; these crystals are the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated and efficient food substance known, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">promote growth. Watch me and notice their</seg><seg type="columnLine">power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The experience was too uncanny for description.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt terror stricken as I watched him, and had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost uncontrollable impulse to shout for the sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief of my overtaxed nerves, but by a supreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort of will I resisted the inclination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He placed two of the crystals in his mouth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For perhaps five or six seconds no change w'as</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent; then a shudder passed over his frame</seg><seg type="columnLine">and before my very eyes he commenced to increase</seg><seg type="columnLine">in size. You have probably been away from home</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some time and upon your return noticed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased stature of some young friends. You re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked how much they had grown while you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. But here before my naked eyes, growth was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking place immediately. It was almost unbeliev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He soon towered over me like a giant. He grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">so tall, that his head touched the ceiling. He began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to walk toward a chair and sat down. Suddenly fie</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped growing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My height" he said, "is now about twelve feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little more than double my former height. If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had wished to become still taller I could have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">so by taking more of the crystals. Think what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief these crystals will be to mankind. No inore</seg><seg type="columnLine">under-developed children! no more short men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">short women. Tomorrow I shall show the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I am a living proof of the existence of a super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">food, the crystals of growth. Try one yourself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jameson, and increase your size."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus speaking, he offered one of the crystals to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I was tempted to laugh at the preposterous</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion and then T looked at his face and realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">how serious the Professor was. I was horrified and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that with my friend in his present state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">super-elation at the result of his experiment--there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an expression of mad fanaticism upon his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the situation demanded tact of the most delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature, if unpleasant and possibly fatal consequences</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to be avoided. So I decided to humor him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Brontley," I evaded. "I don't need any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your growth crystals. I'm tall enough to suit me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and besides I know that they will do all that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim for them, so what's the use?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a second I realized that he was furiously angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my refusal to take the crystals. He came towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and seized me by the shoulders. "You little</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrimp" he sneered, "I'll show you whether you</seg><seg type="columnLine">need them or not." and he began to shake me. 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove to ward off his hold upon me, but it was use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. I was like a child in his grasp and it seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he would shake my head loose from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. My brain reeled, the objects in the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">were becoming dim and seemed to be swimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">around me.

I found myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor in my room, and looking up I saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of my pal, Jack Hudson, gazing down at me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in perplexity. ''I've been trying to wake you up for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last three or four minutes," he declared. "Hurry</seg><seg type="columnLine">up or we'll be late for the show," he added, and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's the matter?

The rest of it was built up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of a cabinet, with bulbs, instead of organ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipes. It was something like an exaggerated and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caricatured radio sending set. There were scores of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulbs, globular, pear-shaped, gourd-like, fiask-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped, and of all sizes from that of an egg to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">as big as a pumpkin. Grant moved a switch. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">complex array of bulbs filled with a pale white glow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They look as though they might be electron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes," I remarked. "Is it some form of musical</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. Not exactly. Sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">down." Grant was elated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, while I found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, he took his place on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bench in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">organ thing. He ran his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers around over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">keys. I stared at him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise. Not a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the instrument.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was it some effect of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">or color that I should look</seg><seg type="columnLine">for? I looked closely, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulbs glowed quite un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. Was he out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind? Not knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">what else to do, I sat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited patiently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat bowed forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my chin leaned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hand and my elbows</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my knees. Grant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements at the silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine became monot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onous and depressing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dingy, concrete walls were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unutterably gray. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomy interior of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shack made me think of some graveyard of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">desires. Even the futile wires sprawled all about, gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mournful impression. I grew so lonesome and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couraged that I could feel the muscles of my face</seg><seg type="columnLine">droop and sag. Grant, failure of a fellow that he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed somehow ragged and dismal as he lugubri-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A/1 USIC, we are laid, charms individuals, nol only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1V1 hitmans. If you have ever seen a Hindu charm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a snake by means of his flute, you zvill understand what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we mean. But not all music charms; some music dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tinctly urates on our nerves. There arc certain pieces</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of music, certain sounds, that arouse savage instincts in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">most of us. as is well known. If vou ever listened to a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cats' concert on the fence, you will understand -what we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mean, too. But there is music, there are sounds which are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">n0 longer heard by the ear, as such. Where the vibra-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions go beyond some 25 thousand per second, the ear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no longer perceives them as sounds, yet the sounds arc</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there, quite loud, as a matter of fact. Recently, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">instance. Mr. Hugo Ccrnsback, Editor of this publica-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion, performed certain experiments at station IVRNY,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where the audibility of the audience was tested, by means</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of an audio frequency oscillator. The particular oscil-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lator used produced audible vibrations from a frequency</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of 100 up to over 30,000 cycles per second. It was found</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that beyond 15,000 vibrations per second, most people</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could hear nothing. It was interesting, howez'cr, that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a number of listeners reported strange effects noted on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">various animals. Some dogs and canaries seemed to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able to hear; so, while the loud speaker was silent to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">human beings, it was noisy enough to disturb certain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">animals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A similar theme is used in the present story, which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not only contains excellent science, but is an exceptional</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scicntifiction story as well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">880</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ously pawed the keys. I watched the heavy smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">drag across the. square of leaden sky visible through</seg><seg type="columnLine">:he window, in the same way that my useless soul was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifting across a colorless and dreary world. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only place for me was at home with my mother; my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother of the white apron and sunny hair, who made</seg><seg type="columnLine">gingersnaps for me. But my mother was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grant stopped his activity at the keys and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. He looked at me intently for a long time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he turned around and started playing again on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dumb, futile keyboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He danced around on his seat like a clown; like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a travesty of Paderewski. He crooked his fingers in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to claws and brought them down wildly on the keys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then ran them through his ruffled hair. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees worked comically up and down as he manipu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated some sort of pedals. He looked so silly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was forced to smile. Then I leaned back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. I laughed at him, and at the funny little</seg><seg type="columnLine">zig-zag wires on the bench near me, like wiggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat's tails, and at the comical shapes assumed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisps of smoke outside the foolish little window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The back of Sergei bent over his work was like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hump on the back of some droll camel; it made me</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh till I rocked. The whole adventure up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountainside with a coal-mine below and a cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventor pounding on an organ that wouldn't work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all so inexpressibly funny that 1 laughed till I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hoarse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GRANT was sitting motionless again, gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixedly at me. As my laughing died down, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned again to the keys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He played slowly, if I could call it playing, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard nothiiig. The crazy fellow, trying to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive me that way! I grew impatient at him*. Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he think 1 was a fool ? I had a strong notion to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him what I thought of him and his abortive inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. His slowness was irritating. I knew he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing it to tantalize me. I felt like giving him a shove</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knocking him off the seat--and kicking him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a corner. My fists clenched and my biceps tightened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why had he brought me into this barred and locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone cell, full of poisons and dangerous currents?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there was that maniac Russian over there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to spring upon me and kill me unawares! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">coward! I looked at him. He straightened up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glared at me with lips curled back from gritted teeth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I seethed with rage against both of them. I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get them both out of my way before I can escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant first. I stood up and stole toward him, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers clutching spasmodically to get hold of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. I wanted to maul him, to break his bones-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He whirled around and saw me. His hand shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and moved a switch. The glow in the bulbs died</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. A sudden limpness went through me; my knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">went weak and I collapsed on the floor. Now every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was peace. I was myself again, wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had been happening tp me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly it dawned on me that Grant's "playing"</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have had something to do with these storms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of emotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 sat up. Sergei was sitting in a chair, pale and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching a bench.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That last effect was foolish of me," Grant was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying. "You might have beaten me up before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized what was happening. My own fault."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stood up, feeling much better physically. Grant</seg><seg type="columnLine">was again the same old good-natured, absent-minded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific child. Sergei also walked away in deferent</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, lie didn't look fierce at all, only humble</seg><seg type="columnLine">and quiet, and very much a gentleman. Think of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a concert musician now at a menial job. And a wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and two girls murdered by Bolsheviks!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Narrow escape, I had," Grant laughed again, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stared around, unable to find words. "And poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Sergei was on his way out to clean up his Bol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shevik neighbors!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's this?" I finally demanded. "What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been happening to me ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will admit that it affected you powerfully?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll say it did! It nearly drove me crazy. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">is it? How is it done? Tell me quick, or I'll get</seg><seg type="columnLine">you yet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I explain," Grant warned, "you will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointed at the simplicity of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm waiting to be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know well," he began, "that emotions are</seg><seg type="columnLine">purely physical states, produced by the activity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ductless or endocrine glands. Stimulation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suprarenal produces rage; that of the thyroid, fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and anxiety; that of the gonads, love, and so forth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warm up the gland, increase the amount of its secre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and the emotion follows. By mixtures and</seg><seg type="columnLine">combinations, an endless chain of emotions may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced. That is well established knowledge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Old stuff!" I agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The next step is, that the operation of the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">cells is merely a matter of the exchange of electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">charges. Secretion, nerve action, muscle contraction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all you do, is merely a movement of electrons from</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing new or startling about that so far," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">commented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The rest isn't so old. I figured that instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting till the exchange of electrons in the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes place by chance impulse and accidental com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">binations of perceptive stimulation, I would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">them for you at will, by shooting electrons at you</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of my vacuum tubes. The numbers, velocities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and quantity-rates of discharge of negative electrons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and various ,varieties of positive ions, determine</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether it is your suprarenal or your pituitary that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is warmed up. Your body obeys; can't help itself."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is simple," I admitted. "But it is uncanny. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly felt real emotions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They were real emotions. And I had a real one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. when I saw you coming--I was scared!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> T sat down to think over the astounding thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had sat up there and played on keys, and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">me feel as I did. And since feeling controls action</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that man had an instrument that could make people</seg><seg type="columnLine">do anything. He had the world at his beck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You just got here in time," he was saying in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most matter-of-fact voice. "We were abbut to begin</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking the machine apart and moving it to a theater.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to give a public performance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tn fact, Sergei was already taking out the electron</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes and packing them in cotton-lined cartons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd like to see that," I said eagerly, my mind full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of interesting possibilities. "When does it come</seg><seg type="columnLine">off?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By all means come. That will be an excuse for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to remain with me for a few days. I am plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning the show for next Friday. Sergei can almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle the moving alone, so you and I can have lots</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time together, for my work at the mine is light."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RIOT AT SANDERAC</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">881</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GRANT'S advertising for his public perform-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance was very modest. I was afraid that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have much of an audience. He announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the newspaper and on billboards that he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific discovery for influencing emotions in a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, without the medium of pictures, music, words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or other common means; something different. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me that he did not care to have a big crowd for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first performance!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the house was packed full. Grant's towns-</seg><seg type="columnLine">people apparently knew him, and expected something</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth while. The buzz of excitement through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theater swelled and waned in rhythmic waves as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people sat and looked at the organ keys and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">assortment of odd-shaped bulbs. The theater was</seg><seg type="columnLine">full; people continued to crowd in, and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">more people outside. And still Grant had not arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had tested out the machine in the afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had waited eagerly for the evening. Then, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">7:30 P. M., he had been called to the power-house</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the mine, where a safety-valve of a loaded boiler</seg><seg type="columnLine">had jammed. Now it was 8:15, and the densely</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed audience shuffled impatiently and broke out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into occasional bursts of clapping to encourage them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At 8:23 a messenger arrived from Grant with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">note. Sergei, who had been hovering anxiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the machine, took it, glanced at it, and handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to me. The note was addressed to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bad job here," it read. "I don't know whom else</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask, and therefore I should like to have you get up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and explain to the audience what the situation is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tell them that I shall be back in an hour. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">may go out, and return in an hour if they wish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Facing an audience has always been unpleasant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, even for such a trifling matter as this.- It took</seg><seg type="columnLine">me some minutes to screw up my courage, but even-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tually I was in front of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The people looked queer. Their eyes were big</seg><seg type="columnLine">and glaring. They sat up rigid. Everyone's teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed in an ugly snarl. Here were the town's best</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, business and professional men whom I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">previously met; well dressed women; as good a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group as one could see in any city. But now they</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like some savage beasts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, suddenly I understood. A glance backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shown me Sergei seated at the keys, his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying, his fingers busy, every inch a musician. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave one more terrified glance at the audience. Peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ples' arms jerked convulsively. One by one they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were leaping fiercely to their feet and surging for-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. I was desperately afraid for my own safety,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I turned and fled across the stage and out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I ran--something I was not accustomed to do. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed and my head throbbed. 1 ran for the power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house where Grant was working on the jammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety valve. An overloaded boiler was less danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous than this fiercely aroused audience. The uproar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shouting and trampling behind me, lent speed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my clumsy progress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I began to feel relieved when I saw the boiler-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house in front of me. Why I do not know, for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">could Grant do? Then, the boiler house acted</seg><seg type="columnLine">queerly. It bulged outwards. The tall chimney stack</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent in the middle like a knee, and seemed to hang</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way for an interminably long time. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great spout of steam, and a terrible boom that rev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erberated and roared for several minutes. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">me was a vast cloud of steam, out of which black</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects flew high in all directions. Some of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stopped. Behind me the clamor of shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trampling was increasing. I looked back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw flames shooting high in the air from the theater</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. A mob of infuriated people was running,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surging, pouring through the streets, brandishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. Terror possessed me. Which way should I</seg><seg type="columnLine">run?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, I soon noted that they were not after</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. They turned and flowed to my left, toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountainside. I stared at them, amazed, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while. In the mean time, shots and screams and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous thuds came from the section on the mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope where the Russian miners lived. Flames shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">up here and there. The attack had fallen on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bolshevik quarter, which was being swiftly wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment I stood frozen in my tracks.

Professor Winter lived on the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirts of town, in an old-fashioned brick residence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two stories, surrounded by an extensive garden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shaded by a great number of magnificent oak</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chestnut trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An old man-servant, whose name--as I later</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned--was Carl Summer, admitted me.

The queer coincidence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their similar given names, and the diametrically</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite meaning of their surnames made me smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I came to think of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found the professor in his very completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped laboratory, examining something in a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">test tube.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come in, come in, Mister Barton!" he cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerfully, "I am certainly glad to see you, I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure," he added as we shook hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having taken the comfortable chair at the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he indicated, I leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and gazed at my host.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a large man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well over six feet tall, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">built in proportion.

However, 1 followed my host into the spa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious library adjoining the laboratory, and saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the very center of the great room, the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">shades of which were closed, two large armchairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were standing side by side, almost touching each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. At the outer side of each chair was placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strong table of oak and steel, covered with a mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shining apparatus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The most conspicuous thing on each of the tables</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a heavy hollow base of burnished steel about</seg><seg type="columnLine">two and one-half feet long, two feet wide, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot or thereabouts high.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The polished steel base was bolted to the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">oaken planks of the table top, and was surmounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a strong steel frame in the form of a lateral cross,</seg><seg type="columnLine">supported by four steel columns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each of these columns was about sixteen inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">high, and securely connected to the heavy cross piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the top. This frame formed the support of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">large spheres of metal, each about twelve inches in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter. One of them seemed composed of bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nished copper; the other appeared to be made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a silver-like metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These spheres were each connected to a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertical shaft of steel which passed through the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. The lower ends of these shafts passed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the interior of the steel bases, while the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of each was supported in a ball-bearing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross piece on top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two slightly smaller sized stationary glass globes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were attached to each of the heavy supporting col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umns at the long ends of the cross, by means of felt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">padded metal clamps, in close proximity to the near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est of the center metal spheres.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The globe nearest to the copper sphere contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">a transparent liquid of a beautiful emerald hue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The one next to the silvery sphere held a mixture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the color of ruby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From each one of the two metal supporting clamps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the glass spheres, heavy insulated flexible wires</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran to the arm chairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon the seat of each chair lay a strong head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress of leather, resembling an aviator's cap. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires from the glass sphere containing the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid, terminated at the sides of the cap, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears would be. The wires from the globe with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruby fluid led to heavy goggles at the front part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hoods. These goggles were of a peculiar con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction, and contained double lenses with a space</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Winter pointed to the apparatus and</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "To describe the entire apparatus and its operation</seg><seg type="columnLine">would perhaps be too technical for your lik-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and would take too long. The essential points</seg><seg type="columnLine">are these: In the base of the machine is the highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed rotary engine in the world--my own inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. It is operated by electricity. The office of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus is to change the vibration of both the</seg><seg type="columnLine">auditory and occular organs to such degree, simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously, that they will be sensitive to the vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions below the infra-red plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The machines on both tables are identical, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept that the controlling switchboard for both is</seg><seg type="columnLine">located on my side."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed to one of the chairs, to the right arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which was attached a small board with a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of electrical contact buttons, and to which a bun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle of insulated wires was brought from the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded, only half understanding what the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor was saying. "Are you sure that everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">will turn out all right?" I inquired dubiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I anticipate no trouble. At the worst, nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">can happen to our physical bodies. They will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe in this room, and Summer will watch outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. Anything that we might see or otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense can not affect our physical well-being."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," I said. But of course I did not. "Well</seg><seg type="columnLine">then--" I continued-- "If you think that everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">is as it should be, I would suggest that we start, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause I confess that I am getting slightly nervous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After all--this is quite an undertaking!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Winter nodded seriously. "Yes, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are right, and you can never know how I appreciate</seg><seg type="columnLine">your cooperation in this adventure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He held out his hand and we shook hands earnestly. •</seg><seg type="columnLine">With very mixed feelings I sat down in the chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my host indicated. "Just relax your body and</seg><seg type="columnLine">your mind, and you will feel better," he advised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he adjusted the leathern cap to my head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few moments later he had fastened on his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">headgear. With a cordial motion, he waved his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to me and touched one of the buttons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately a high musical note was audible. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed toward the apparatus at my left. The copper</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere was whirling madly, and the emerald fluid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the adjoining glass globe seemed to become in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely illuminated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The musical note rose higher and higher, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed to tax the auditory, organs to the utter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most. Questioningly, I turned toward the professor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was just in the act of pressing another button.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And immediately the white metal spheres on our</seg><seg type="columnLine">respective tables began to revolve with inconceivable</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed as if a thin fog was beginning to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velop the objects in the room. The fog-like phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomenon was getting momentarily more dense. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong electric lights of the library seemed to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come gradually dimmer and dimmer, until they ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared like the headlights of an automoible through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very dense fog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was getting darker and darker every moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. The scientist at my side was hardly visible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then suddenly the most absolute darkness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be imagined enveloped us like a heavy mantle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Temporarily alarmed, I reached out my hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the professor. Immediately I felt his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuring pat on my arm. I was greatly relieved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently everything was as it should be. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammering pulse, I awaited further developments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">886</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE--was it imagination, due to my over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained senses?--there seemed to be a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet light permeating the Stygian darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The violet light was certainly getting stronger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My senses had not deceived me then. I waited ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citedly for--I knew not what.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly I became aware of another phenomenon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The high musical sound, after taxing my auditory</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve to its uttermost, had completely ceased, and--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was almost certain that I heard a faint sound as of</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant singing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was now in a fever of expectancy. I felt intui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively that some wonderful development was immi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent. The violet light was getting brighter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter; and in about the same ratio it seemed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the singing sound, as of a multitude, was increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in volume also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was happening ? Were we really passing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another plane of existence? Was the experiment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Winter about to be successful ? With</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever)' nerve tingling, I waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All that was now visible was that peculiar fog-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomenon, lighted up with the soft violet light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rest was emptiness. I gazed over toward my</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion, but could see nothing of him either. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be on a lonely island in a violet sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then--as if through many curtains of violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">gauze, I saw all about me, it seemed, the semi-nude</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures of gigantic men and women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly everything was quite clear, and I gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the strangest spectacle-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I seemed to be in a vast cathedral-like place; so</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast was it, that I could not perceive the top of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dense violet shadows above me. Nor could</seg><seg type="columnLine">my vision penetrate to the walls that I instinctively</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt were on either side of me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Great columns of what seemed to be purple-col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ored metal, brilliantly polished, rose upward into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unfathomable heights forming wide aisles on all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of me. I seemed to be in the very center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the widest of these aisles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Straight down this great main-aisle, in the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion toward which I was facing, and at what might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the end of it, I saw an immense altar-like struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of some material, which at this distance ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be white alabaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Broad wide steps led to the top of this structure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which vvas formed by a wide platform, covered above</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a great semi-spherical baldachin of what appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be blue crystal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under this crystal dome, two great golden chairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were placed side by side, and seated upon them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I perceived two human figures--a man and a woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  About and in front of this throne, and on all sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as the eyes could see, a great multitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people were gathered. Thousands they seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, of such physical perfection as to remind me of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fabled gods and goddesses of ancient Greece.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very tall they were--all of them. I judged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to be at least seven feet in height, .and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women about six. The faces of both were beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hairless, their coloring an exquisite white and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose ; their hair, which the women wore long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unrestrained, and the men down to their necks, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of every shade of blond, and of a fine wavy texture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their heads were crowned with chaplets of gor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geous, fragrant flowers, and garlands of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers adorned their bodies. With the exception</seg><seg type="columnLine">of very broad loin-cloths, of vari-colored shiny</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">material of fine texture, the men were nude. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">women were arrayed in a sort of simple sleeveless</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunic, supported from the shoulders by narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">straps of the same material as the men wore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They all stood erect, with arms upraised above</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads, facing the two upon the throne. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">they sang an anthem of such wonderful exquisite</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmony and volume, and such liquid clear tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I would never have believed existed in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 GLANCED toward Professor Winter, whom I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had nearly forgotten. For a moment I was ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribly afraid, because I could not see him. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of his explanations came to my mind. I gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at my own body, and--as I expected--saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a strange, eerie leeling. 1 seemed to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sist of nothing but brain. To all intents and pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses I was an invisible being, even to myself. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few moments of reflection reassured me. Ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently Professor Winter's experiment was a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect success; a monument, as it were, to his genius.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As far as my senses were concerned, I was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sub-infra-red plane, though my physical body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the earth plane. It was in truth a most fantastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To reassure myself beyond doubt, I felt toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with my invisible hand, and to my great relief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched his body. He gave my hand a reassuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeeze to indicate that everything was in order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Naturally, I thought, as long as the machine in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor's library was running and our visual</seg><seg type="columnLine">and auditory organs therefore were tuned to a vastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">different vibration, we could not possibly hear or</seg><seg type="columnLine">see each other. As an experiment, I shouted, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard not the slightest sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a marvellous experiment and an amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience, and I was conscious of deep gratitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the scientist for having given me the opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sharing it with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We must have been invisible to the sub-infra-red</seg><seg type="columnLine">people also, because those immediately surrounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">us gave not the slightest sign of noting anything out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ordinary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The singing ceased, the people lowered their arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gazed expectantly toward the great throne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, amidst absolute silence, the two beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the throne, whom I judged to be the Rulers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these people, rose from their seats, came to the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the throne platform, and faced the audience.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And even at that distance I realized that physically</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were superior even to any of their own sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man wore a sort of tunic of white shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloth, which came almost to his knees, and Was sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended by a strap of gold from his left shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving his right breast free. Upon his broad chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">an emblem in the shape of two outspread wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittered and scintillated with every movement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his perfect body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His companion Ruler wore a similar sleeveless</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunic, but suspended from both shoulders, and drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping just below the knees. And upon her perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded bosom glittered a similar emblem of double</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings. Their feet, like those of their people, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare. And they also had adorned themselves with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beautiful strange flowers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I watched, continued to watch them, fascinated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BELOW THE INFRA RED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">887</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Each one raised the right hand with the palm out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and placed the left hand over the heart. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">while they stood thus they sang a duet of such har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony and perfect symphony that I was completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">entranced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In some mysterious manner their singing suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">became intelligible to me. Through some marvellous</seg><seg type="columnLine">process of the mind, I was able to receive telepathi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally the thoughts they meant to convey, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing the language itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our language is very crude compared to the per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect song-language of the sub-infra-red people. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following is approximately what they, the Rulers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveyed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beloved people! in the name of the Ruler of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible and invisible universe, welcome!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This day, which marks an illuminated period in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cycle of our reign, beloved brothers and sisters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fills our hearts and minds with great happiness.

I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that T was gradually rising out of my physical body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was an indescribable sensation. It seemed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I, the soul, was slipping out of my invisible physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell, like a snake slipping out of its last year's hide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The peculiar eerie thing about the process was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct feeling that in some dim past I had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a similar process.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought of the professor and wondered what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to say about this wonderful phenomenon</seg><seg type="columnLine">when, lo! there he was standing at my side, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly visible and smiling at my evident astonishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and agitation. What is more, he appeared very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much younger than when I had last seen him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Glancing down at my own body, I found that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">also had become quite visible by some wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">alchemy of nature. And with the ability to see my</seg><seg type="columnLine">body once more, came the feeling that somehow it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not the same body, but a new body which pul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sated with all the virility and elasticity and joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of youth. I possessed the same tireless energy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">buoyancy that I remembered having when a boy. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was marvellous, unbelievable. At last I seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have discovered the fountain of eternal youth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What in the world has happened now, Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winter?" I inquired. "What does it all mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled radiantly, and his eyes, from which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectacles had disappeared, were brilliant with en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiasm when he answered: "It means, dear friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I have attained more, infinitely more, than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed. It means that the vibrations of our phy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sical bodies were raised to such a degree that our</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiritual bodies have temporarily become liberated</seg><seg type="columnLine">and separated from our physical shells. To all in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tents and purposes, we are now inhabitants of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane below the infra red."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded somewhat dazed. A slow dim compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hension was beginning to filter into my mind.

Therefore I put an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You spoke about ourselves being In our spiritual</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies. I don't seem to be able to grasp that part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, although, in a dim way, I seem to grasp some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of what you mean to convey.

That is to say, man con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sists of a soul, which is his real ego or self, a spiri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tual body, and a physical body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The physical body and its sensory organism is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soul's instrument of expression and manifesta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion while living on the physical plane, by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it gathers experience and knowledge for its</seg><seg type="columnLine">development and unfoldment, according to nature's</seg><seg type="columnLine">law of evolution and progress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After the change called death, the soul and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiritual body, which latter co-exists with the phy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sical body during earth life, withdraws from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead shell and takes up its life on the spiritual plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it leaves off on the earth plane. The spiritual</seg><seg type="columnLine">world being a material world similar to the physical,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but of infinitely higher vibration and refinement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are then duties to perform, work to do, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience to gather for the soul; this it does by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of the spiritual body and its sensory organism,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is identical with, but infinitely finer, than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical sensory organism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In other words, the soul continues to carry on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its search for the truth, for knowledge and wisdom</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that world as in the physical world; and frort</seg><seg type="columnLine">it when its time comes, it evolutes to still higher ana</seg><seg type="columnLine">finer planes of existence, in still finer bodies, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming to and consistent with the vibrations of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular plane.

For instance, if it were possible to so attune</seg><seg type="columnLine">the physical sensory organs as to correspond with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vibrations of spiritual matter, then it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite possible for any of us to see or otherwise sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything that goes on in the spiritual plane closest</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth. But this would conflict with natural laws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laws of vibration, and it is therefore impossible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No one can change or overcome the laws of nature."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I GAZED in wonder at the man of science and</seg><seg type="columnLine">marveled at his knowledge.

And I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to take your word for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had become so engrossed in our conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we quite forgot our environment. Perfect si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence reigned. But it seemed to be a silence vibrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">with human magnetism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We gazed about us. The sub-infra people ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently were able to see us also, for every eye in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that vast place was fixed upon us in seeming word-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less awe and astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently we perceived a movement at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the central aisle, where the throne was located. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then we saw that the two Rulers had descended from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throne and were coming toward us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A lane formed rapidly in the great throng of peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple, and along this the majestic couple advanced with</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet dignity. A few paces from us they stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and raised both hands, with open palms toward us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Welcome, strange friends!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was as if they had spoken in our own language,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so clearly did my mind receive the thought behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">their words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following my companion's example, I also raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">both hands in their manner, also attempting as gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious a smile as our hosts gave us. To our great</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment and embarrassment both embraced each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us in turn, and touched their lips to our fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were unable to say anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The greetings over, the exalted brother--such was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his official title, we learned kter--took the profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor's left hand and led the way to the throne. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow Ruler, a woman of transcendant beauty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grace took possession of my left hand in like man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, and we followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From every side the people seemed to greet us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with brotherly acclaim and smiles of welcome. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was indeed a triumphal procession. I walked as</seg><seg type="columnLine">(hough in a dream. The glorious woman at my side</seg><seg type="columnLine">emitted a perfume like atlar of roses, subtle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate like the scent of a dewy rose at sunrise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was wonderful, almost intoxicating, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hand there passed to me a current of magnetism</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was intensely delicious, causing my entire entity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to vibrate with a strange power and awakening all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was noble in my soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What a marvelous world, I thought, and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous this human perfection of the flower-be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">decked people all about me. Tt was as if I were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hero of some wonderful romance, walking to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">altar with my beloved princess. Past great metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining ornamental columns of immense height, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fathomable in the all-pervading strange violet light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently I became conscious of music, soft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet and entrancing, like the wind sweeping gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the strings of ancient zeolean harps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were upon the platform, facing the people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were gazing up at us in expectation. Perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence reigned; even the soft music seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased. We two earth dwellers were between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">royal pair, standing at the outer edge of the throne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">altar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With exquisite courtesy, the exalted brother spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us: "Strange friends, in the name of our people</seg><seg type="columnLine">we beg of you to tell us where is the land you call</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, and in what manner you have appeared so</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysteriously among us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We saw you first as indistinct luminous shapes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then you gradually took the forms of men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tell us, are you men or spirits ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVERY eye in that immense assembly was riv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eted on us. At my earnest urging, the professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to explain the manner of our appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was strange but just as we readily received</seg><seg type="columnLine">their thoughts, by means of the invisible waves, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">they quickly understood us. Apparently the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration of our semi-spiritual bodies made this pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible and natural. Words were merely a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">form and sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Professor Winter had finish J, the Ruler</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to us with a radiant face, "it must be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful world to which you belong. Can you re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to it as easily as you left it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Winter gazed at me in a distinctly dep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">recating manner, and spread out his hands in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressive gesture of helplessness. "That, Exalted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brother, is something 1 do not know." He indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with a respectful wave of his hand as he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued: "When I began this experiment with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">honored friend I did not anticipate such an amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">success. I never dreamed that we would be liber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated from our physical bodies and consequently made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no arrangements for such a contingency." The gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">he directed toward me was expressive of deep re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gret as he finished:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am now extremely sorry for having placed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend in such a predicament!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a smile that must have expressed my deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">content, I waved his regret aside. "Don't worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">about me, old chap. I am perfectly satisfied! Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my life have I imagined such wonderful sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings, and such a delightful situation. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no family ties, and like yourself, will not be missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that dreary old world of ours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man of science appeared greatly relieved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Ruler smiled approvingly. "I, Elo'li, wish to</seg><seg type="columnLine">commend both of you for your courage! In like</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances there are few who would show the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">same degree of courage: and-" here he turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to his companion, "--I am certain that my dear sister</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ealara will concur with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The beautiful, angelic woman at my side smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetly and nodded. The light from her radiant</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes caused my pulses to beat with a rapidity</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had never experienced before in all my life. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole body tingled and glowed with exaltation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both the professor and I bowed in recognition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">(lie generous praise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next minute our hosts conducted us down</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the throne, and again we passed along the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">center aisle through the human lane of beautiful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scented people until we came to an immense semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular portal, resembling the great outer doors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">BELOW THE INFRA RED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">889</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the cathedrals I had seen in Europe. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment later we passed out into a garden of en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chantment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last I had a very definite conception of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fabled garden of the Olympians must have been.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there above us, was our old friend, the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently the same, yet shining with less glare, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">emitting only moderate heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Great shady trees were all about us. Some re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembled palms, with immense leaves about twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet long, and the width of a man. Some were like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the banyan trees of India with many trunks, grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful as the exquisite columns of the Alhambra of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spain, creating avenues under their great leafy</seg><seg type="columnLine">domes of emerald, where promenading was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were also other trees, and shrubs, too nu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merous to mention. And the flowers! Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these were the same fragrant white blossoms with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the people were decorated and which our</seg><seg type="columnLine">guides wore; others resembled immense orchids,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vari-colored, and exhaling a perfume like heliotrope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hundreds of varieties abounded everywhere, set</seg><seg type="columnLine">off exquisitely against the blue-green grassy moss</seg><seg type="columnLine">which covered the ground like a deep soft carpet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over which we passed without a sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I noticed no flies or other insects, but at intervals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the flashings of exquisite gems, brilliantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">plumed birds passed over the flowers and through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foliage overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to view the place whence we had emerged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an exclamation of amazement escaped me, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled my three companions. I looked at Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winter and pointed. His gaze followed the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my hand, and he also uttered a cry of amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great auditorium was located on an immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff of a white marble-like stone, which by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful, incredible feat of sculpture, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed into a gigantic bust of a beautiful woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect in every detail. It was stupendous, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">two earth dwellers could only stand there and stare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in admiration of the titanic work of art.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A duet of musical soft laughter aroused us from</seg><seg type="columnLine">our contemplation. Eloli and Ealara were gazing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">us smilingly. The soft harmonious voice of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter caressed my ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are gazing upon the likeness of Sainana,</seg><seg type="columnLine">first woman Ruler of Alania, our country, dear</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Winter expressed himself in an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiastic manner, and praised the colossal, yet ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quisite, work of art, while I concurred most heartily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is nothing to compare with it in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">world!" he emphasized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> T nodded. "The sphinx of Egypt compares with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as the moon to the sun, both in size and in beauty;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great pyramid of Gizeh could be placed within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the superb head and leave enough room for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">army."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two Rulers were greatly pleased with our ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressions of appreciation. Eloli explained:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thus do we honor our best beloved ancestors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by using their likenesses for our most sacred abode,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our home. Since many generations this has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the custom of our people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE PASSED on and presently came to a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of circular pavilion, built of a marble-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">semi-transparent stone, and covered by a great hemi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spherical dome of emerald-hued transparent sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great dome rested upon an exquisitely sculp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured entablature, supported by a great number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender graceful columns. In the center, under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerald ifoof, a marvelously executed group of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">nude maidens formed from an alabaster-like sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance, caught our eyes the moment we entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool interior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two figures stood back to back, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetly smiling faces were raised upward to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon their elevated hands they supported a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowl of tulip formation from which a great foun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain of water shot upward fully forty or fifty feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curving outward and downward in an immensely</seg><seg type="columnLine">enlarged form of the bowl, and falling in a refresh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing aromatic shower into the wide crystal basin be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Winding our way through the myriad ferns in</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful stone containers, we soon found ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the edge of the great crystal basin. Courteously</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hosts bade us to be seated upon the circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench which surrounded it, and which permitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to refresh his feet in the cool water beneath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickly the professor and I removed our shoes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">emulated the example of Eloli and Ealara, his sister.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eloli emitted a peculiar high tone, and imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately two beautiful maids appeared. One of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore a crystal tray with a basket woven from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold-like metallic wire, from which several different</seg><seg type="columnLine">kinds of aromatic, beautifully colored, strange fruits</seg><seg type="columnLine">peeped forth temptingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other held a tray of golden metal, upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">artistically engraved surface of which stood four</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessels, shaped like large eggs standing on their ends</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the large portion cut off, and the lower part sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported in tripods of metal, like transparent gold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With her own hands, Ealara took one of the ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sels from the tray and presented it to me, while her</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother offered the other to the scientist. Hesitantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">I received the delicate container from my beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostess and placed my lips to the edge of the fra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gile transparent vessel that seemed to be made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finest white porcelain imaginable. Carefully I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tasted of the cool, slightly effervescing liquid and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it marvelously palatable and refreshing. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave of new strength seemed to course through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">body from it, and involuntarily I smacked my lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I finished the last few drops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In courteous terms I expressed my appreciation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was just about to ask how the beverage was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made, when suddenly we heard distant cries as of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, and a commotion outside in the garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Eloli and his sister rose quickly and gazed in alarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the entrance. A moment later a young Alan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian rushed in, sank to one knee and bowed, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left hand placed over the heart and the right flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exalted Brother, the Pluonians are coming!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reported and there was suppressed excitement in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Pluonians! I felt some calamity at hand;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the suddenly stern face of Eloli confirmed it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So even this paradise was not without its snakes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gazed at Ealara. She was calm, and her eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed upon her brother's face with quiet confidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The latter made a sign for the messenger to rise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bid Alam to come immediately!" he commanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man made an obeisance and sped away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">890</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are these Pluonians, Exalted Brother?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Winter inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eloli folded his great arms across his wide chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his face was very grave as he explained:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Pluonians are a terrible enemy, a lower race</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ours, who hate us because of our progress and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our harmony among ourselves. Occasionally they</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter into ruthless warfare against us; often they</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in the night and carry off our women and</seg><seg type="columnLine">children. Come! Every minute counts now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We passed out of the pavilion and just outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the entrance were met by a powerfully-built mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tial-looking Alanian. This was Alam, chief of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alanian army. He bowed deeply to the two Rulers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I await your orders!" he said simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eloli spoke rapidly: "Are the warriors ready?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alam inclined his head." They are now forming</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the defense."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the women and children?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are being rushed to the top chamber."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eloli nodded. "It is well, I shall lead in battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself!" he stated sternly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then turning to Ealara he placed both hands on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her shoulders and his eyes radiated a world of tender</seg><seg type="columnLine">brotherly love as he spoke gently: "Sister beloved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you go and comfort the women and children, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pray to the Great Ruler of the Universe for strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our bodies and power to overcome the evil will</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the enemy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They embraced tenderly and kissed each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">■upon the cheeks. After taking leave of myself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor, she walked rapidly away, with such</seg><seg type="columnLine">grace and lightness that she seemed to float.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After having received several rapid orders Alam</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried away also. Eloli turned to us, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was genuine sadness and regret in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Friends, I am very sad that this trouble had to oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cur to mar the pleasure of your visit among us!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Li t us hope and pray that ours will be the victory."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both the professor and I fervently seconded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come," he said, "I shall lead you where you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be safe, and whence you can witness that which shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">take place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led us swiftly back to the great human edifice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the wide portal. From the outer gate in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high garden wall a steady stream of women and</seg><seg type="columnLine">children flowed - toward the palace, to disappear</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the wide portal into the interior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were coming from the city outside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace walls which we had not yet seen. Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women were calm, some excited and some evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently frightened. But most of the children ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to enjoy the prospect of war and excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we learned later, there was a great inner stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">staircase which led to the top of the immense stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure, into the head of it. Just at the level of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic eyes was a vast observation chamber; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was into this that the women and children entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">loi safety s sake. I he bottom of the stone stairway</seg><seg type="columnLine">was m times of danger, closed by means of a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">block of stone and could be opened only from within</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that the inmates were safe as long as their water</seg><seg type="columnLine">and food lasted. I he eyes of the head served as</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows. lhese immense apertures, by the wav</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the only window openings in the entire colossai</seg><seg type="columnLine">edifice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A SHORT distance from the main entrance Eloli</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. We were facing a smooth wall. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched a certain spot, and to our great surprise a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large block of stone swung outward as if on hinges,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disclosing a narrow stairway beyond. Embracing</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of us in turn, the Ruler pointed to the stairway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This stair leads to the chamber of Loalio, man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wisdom. He will explain to you many things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Go in peace!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We entered, and immediately the stone door swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into place. We began to mount the stairs.

But fight as he would, with all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental power at his command, he could not check</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gradual domination of his cranial functions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The mental power of Eloli seemed like a keen sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">which cut off his sensory channels one by one from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently his muscles became inactive; and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dread power swept downward into his primary</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain, dominating the nerve system.

Uruom was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A great cry of rage and fear went up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black warriors as they realized that, with the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their king, the battle was lost for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A greater shout of triumph sounded from the lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the white warriors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the dark forest beyond a great blare, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an immense horn, sounded.

But many were taken as prisoners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The battle was over. Behind us Loalio raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">both hands to heaven and gave silent thanks to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great Ruler of the universe. Reverently, with bowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads, the professor and I waited until he had fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished.

With</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined heads, and in the vast silence, they listened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as in deep melodious tones, the voice of the wise</seg><seg type="columnLine">man rolled out in thanksgiving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ceremony over, the happy people filed out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great auditorium; while I and Professor Winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastened to express our felicitations to Eloli. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loalio leading, we passed from the throne room</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a magnificent banquet hall.

On the ceiling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gamboling children, exquisitely carved, and painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in lifelike colors, were chasing birds of brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">plumage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE passed on to the very center of the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a massive oval table, covered with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure white damask-like cloth, was laid for ten per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons, and beautifully adorned with flowers in origi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal artistic designs. Before each place was a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden plate, and one of the exquisite, delicate gob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets we had already seen in the garden. No knives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forks or other tableware were visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind each one of the ivory-like finely carved</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs was stationed a beautiful servant girl, who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at our approach, pulled back the chairs for us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Loalio had passed to the head of the table. While</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stood there at our appointed places, he first raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands heavenward in a gesture of supplication,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he spread them over the table in blessing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The simple ceremony over, we seated ourselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately, from a curtained alcove, there '</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded delightful, soft music, evidently from string</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments. And at almost the same time the beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful servants began to bring us fruits, and a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of delicious wafer that literally melted on the tongue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the same sort of invigorating drink that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been served to us earlier in the garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fruits, some of which resembled our kinds on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth-plane, were delicious. There were no hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">foods, nor meats of any kind. Evidently the Alan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ians were thorough vegetarians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in one other respect the meal was quite dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent from any similar function in our own world:</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no conversation during the meal. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">badinage, repartee and social chit-chat that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">know would have been decidedly out of place among</seg><seg type="columnLine">such ideal surroundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, there was not the slightest indication of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffness of any sort. Instead, it was with a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided feeling of comfort and well-being that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal progressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the professor's side Eloli, the ruler, ate his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruit With quiet serenity, while at my left Ealara de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted me with her nearness. Evidently Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winter and I had been given the places of honor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a sign from Loalio, the music ceased. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to us with a smile, and said, "Friends, I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready now to answer the questions which 1 see in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your minds!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scientist's face became eager at once. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved his hand about the vast apartment. "I greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to know by what method and process it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to carve such a wonderful dwelling out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the living rock. Do you also use explosives as we,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth dwellers do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wise man did not understand the professor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">term, "explosives," whereupon the latter proceeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain as best he could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When my companion adventurer had finished, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">former sat silent a few moments in thought. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gave a quiet command to one of the maidens, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">departed quickly, and a few minutes later ushered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in four strong men who between them, in a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sling, carried a great block of stone which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed upon a small round but strong table that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the servants had pushed between the professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the wise man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the carriers had departed, Loalio reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth his right hand and touched his index finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the stone block. His face was quite calm, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his eyes seemed to radiate terrific power. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as I watched in amazement, the stone changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">its form.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed to grow larger and a mistiness seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to surround it. Then, when the mistiness had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, I gazed in utter stupefaction upon the per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect sculptured likeness of my friend, Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winter. The whole process had not taken more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than two or three minutes. It was unbelievable; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I rose and touched the stone bust to make certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was not an optical illusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The others had watched me in amusement. As for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my companion, he was the intensely interested sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">entist. Immediately he turned to Loalio for an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation of the phenomena.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a grave smile the wise man complied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you probably know, there exist four life ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments in Nature, the electro-magnetic, the vito-chem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical. the spiritual, and the soul element."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Winter nodded and his eyes gleamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Loalio continued: "The first of these elements</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls the mineral world : the first and second com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bined the plant world; the first, second and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiritual element combine in the animal, and all four</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the elements compose the human entity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What I have done with this stone is simply due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my control of the electro-magnetic element. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as easy to disintegrate the rock in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner. Watch!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he stretched out his hand toward the stone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickly a cloud of mist formed about it, becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicker and thicker, until it formed a sort of cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">about ten times the original size of the stone. Slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">it lifted from the table and gently floated to the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickly the cloud phenomenon sank down, thinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disappeared, leaving on the floor an area of about</seg><seg type="columnLine">one square yard, covered with thick white dust--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">composing particles of what had been a huge stone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">894</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE I stared at Loalio in awe, the professor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rosg quickly, walked over to the disintegrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone dust and rubbed some of it through his fingers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He nodded, satisfied, and explained to me: "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder is finer than the best mill could possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">grind it. The reason is that the stone has been dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">integrated and separated into individual molecules."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how?'' I was utterly bewildered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Regretfully, he shook his head. "That I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know; but--" here he bowed respectfully to the wise</seg><seg type="columnLine">man "--some day I hope to learn the method."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Loalio nodded gravely. "It is possible, my friend;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the attainment of control over Nature's forces re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quires many years of intense study, perseverance, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice. Very few attain this power; for to most</seg><seg type="columnLine">people it is too difficult a problem to solve, requiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it does perfect self-control and the living of a life</seg><seg type="columnLine">in strict accordance with Nature's Constructive</seg><seg type="columnLine">I 'rinciple."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose from the table and all of us followed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">example. While the officers bowed deeply and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the banquet hall to go back to their duties, Loalio led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way into an adjoining chamber which proved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the music room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were several string instruments somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling the ancient lyres of the Greeks, and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">were similar to the large harps on our plane, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exception that the strings ran horizontally instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vertically. In the center of the great room stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instrument which resembled nothing which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever seen in our own world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a great tripod, fully seven feet high; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, very heavy at the bottom and tapering at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top were composed of a semi-transparent substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">like topaz. At the top the legs were fastened to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangular plate of a white metal, and at the bottom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a similar but far larger plate. Through the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters of these two plates, and rigidly attached to them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed a metallic rod; thick at the bottom and gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally tapering to the size of a man's small finger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ranged on this rod, according to size, one above an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. were a great number of triangular metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates, beginning large and thick at the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument and ending in small ones of wafer-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinness at the top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ealara, who had led me by the hand, invited me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sweet courtesy to be seated upon one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable divan-like chairs, and walked to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tripod. With two slender wooden rods, she began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">play it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly the chamber was filled with exquisite</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones of perfect harmony, a strange melody, arousing</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that was good and poetic in my soul. Ealara</seg><seg type="columnLine">played with delicate touch and deep feeling, giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth waves of wonderful symphony, which raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">my soul to a condition of veritable bliss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even Professor Winter, scientist that he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed spellbound by the music. And Loalio and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eloli sat there in visible deep contented revery as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves of harmony caressed their ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the beautiful player had finished, both the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor and I hastened to express our enthusiastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon the conversation devolved chiefly upon Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Winter and Loalio. From what the wise man</seg><seg type="columnLine">said it appeared that: •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were many nations on the sub-infra plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of them white and advanced peoples. The rest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which the Pluonians belonged, were primitive and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark-skinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the head of each white nation were two chosen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rulers, a man and a woman who ruled jointly. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">male Ruler was chosen by the men of the nation, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman by the female citizens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were selected because of their superior wis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom, purity of character, and their true sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">equity, justice and right. Sometimes, as in the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Eloli and Ealara, it happened that the two Rulers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were chosen from the same family.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every three years a great competition was held</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the capital of each nation, at which all the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced citizens of both sexes participated. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">who excelled in all the intellectual and moral tests</seg><seg type="columnLine">were chosen as the next Rulers. Often the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">rulers were chosen for a second term.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At each period of nine years the supreme intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lectuals from all the white nations, Rulers and others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembled in the central capital of Orth. There the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supreme test was held. Whoever passed it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">chosen as the central Rulers for a period of nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. To them all the other white nations looked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">guidance and counsel. The central Rulers were also</seg><seg type="columnLine">one man and one woman, with exactly equal powers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their individual spheres of activity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In case that one of the Rulers should die before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expiration of his term, the next highest intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lectual was chosen until the next election.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The paramount duty of the Rulers was the intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lectual, spiritual, moral and psychic evolution and</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress of their peoples. There was no industry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and commerce as we on our plane understand them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The needs of the people were few.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their climatic conditions, too, differed from ours:</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was always mild summer weather. This necessi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated few clothes, which, very likely, partially ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted for the complete absence of any sickness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were all strict vegetarians, and each family</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew sufficient fruits and vegetables for its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">needs.	,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only when something needed to be done for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">common good, or for the Rulers, did the whole nation</seg><seg type="columnLine">join forces. An inherent sense of duty and love</seg><seg type="columnLine">made them see to the needs of each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The servant problem was met in the same way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the servants in the palaces of the Rulers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">there voluntarily for a period of one year, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">they desired to stay longer. The only medium of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">change was personal service.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THESE people produced many fine artists and</seg><seg type="columnLine">craftsmen. There were 110 churches. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a country of monotheists who believed in an invisible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">omnipotent and loving Ruler of the universe, whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">they worshipped at intervals in the palaces of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rulers, as we had seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Birth was the same as on our plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last death was mentioned. And right here we</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard something very strange. It answered the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken questions in my mind about the dead left on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the,battle field. I had not seen any of them brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, and had seen no preparations for their burial; so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had wondered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strange fact that Loalio mentioned in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">connection was that the body of a person after death</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not decay--it literally evaporated. As soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Iife-element was withdrawn from the body at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time of death, the strange chemical process of nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">began, until, at the end of about one of our hours, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body had completely disappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BELOW THE INFRA RED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They believed that after physical death, the soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothed in a finer body, passed into a finer higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'It is a material world like this" explained Loalio,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but of liner matter, and infinitely higher vibration."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The advanced wise men like Loalio, who was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ex-central Ruler, were of such high spiritual devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opment, that they could communicate with the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">world with full consciousness, while still in the phy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sical body and in full possession of their will and</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluntary powers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They believed that the evolution of man is prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically an eternal process, that the soul in ever refined</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies ascends from plane to plane until it reaches an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultimate condition of perfection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One point Loalio made very clear: that it is im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible for the individual soul to find self-com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletion or perfection alone; in order to reach that</seg><seg type="columnLine">high state of being, the perfect vibratory union of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">masculine and a feminine soul is absolutely necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Loalio said: "That is the reason why we devote</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of our best energies to the development of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">true love nature. We bring up our children by im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planting the germ of love deeply into their minds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not only individual love, but altruism as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We teach them from the very beginning how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">control the destructive passions and impulses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their physical natures, and how to re-direct these</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulses into constructive channels. It is this which</seg><seg type="columnLine">has made possible the abolition of war among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white peoples on our plane."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What a wonderful world we would have if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could reach such a point. No more wars, no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppression of the peoples by the powerful. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">more hatred between classes, for there would be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">classes; no more grafting, stealing, murder or other</seg><seg type="columnLine">transgressions; no more high taxes to pay for war</seg><seg type="columnLine">debts and for armament in preparation of new wars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would be glorious to see the end of crime, court-</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses and jails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here Ealara read my thoughts and asked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it then such a terrible world from which you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come? Surely not all the people there are bad. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am sure that both of you are good men! Are there</seg><seg type="columnLine">not many such ? Are not your women good ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We assured her that there were more good than</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad people in our world, and that our women formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main moral foundation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then to my own great astonishment, Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winter told them that he had heard of wise men on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our plane who lived holy lives and could control the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces of nature; how through their control of na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture's forces they could create things, make flowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow from seeds in a few minutes, and so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">more strange things. These wise men were in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, living secluded lives and pursuing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">studies in secret; making every effort for the good</seg><seg type="columnLine">of humanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, to my intense embarrassment, Eloli turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me with a smile. "It seems, my friend, that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt the existence of these holy men and their pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers on your own plane!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, gazing from one to the other of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three exalted Alanians. I knew that they had easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">read my skeptic attitude of mind, of which T had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been but semi-conscious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I made an apologetic gesture. "I am sorry! But</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind seems to be of a quality which cannot accept</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a fact anything that I have not personally experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enced or demonstrated."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eloli asked one of the maids present to place upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor before us a golden earth-filled pot and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">seed from one of the flowers in pots, which, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their wonderful coloring and perfume served to</seg><seg type="columnLine">adorn the fine apartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE turned to me. "Not to entertain, but to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struct you, shall 1 demonstrate to you that</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things are possible." He bowed, with deep re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spect, in the direction of Loalio. "Our Supreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">Exalted Brother has demonstrated to you his control</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the electro-magnetic forces of Nature. I. his</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply grateful pupil, shall demonstrate to you that</seg><seg type="columnLine">control over the next higher, the vito-chemical ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, in combination with the lower, is possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His right hand, with the index and second fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended, pointed to the seed in the golden plate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he concentrated upon it with fixed intensity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And even as we watched intently, a little cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of luminous mist seemed to surround it, becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly larger as it rose into a column several feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in height. Gradually within the mist phenomenon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faint tracery of a flower plant appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first it was very faint, but it rapidly became</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and more distinct until, no more than two min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes later, the misty light phenomenon cleared away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there before us, in all its beauty, covered with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude of fresh aromatic blossoms, stood a mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificent flower bush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I rubbed my eyes and pinched my leg to make sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was not an illusion. Then, while our hosts</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched me with smiling sympathy, I emulated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">example of my fellow-adventurer, who had broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">off one of the flowers, and was examining it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense interest. There was no doubt about its</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuineness, but I was not entirely satisfied, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the flower bush with my fingers, and fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed it all the way down to wbere it disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the soil. So hard is it to overcome prejudice</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bias. But I was convinced at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marvellous? I could not find adequate terms to</seg><seg type="columnLine">express myself. T gazed at Ealara; and then I stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredulously, for sweetly smiling at me, she was fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming invisible, a mere transparent wraith, until,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quicker than it takes to tell, she had completely dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to my other three companions in bewil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derment. The professor was staring with scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">analytic interest at the chair which the queen had</seg><seg type="columnLine">but recently occupied. I was about to formulate a</seg><seg type="columnLine">question, when, following the smiling gaze of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two exalted Alanians, I perceived Ealara seated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her place just as visible as she had been before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment, and smiling at me with a warmth that</seg><seg type="columnLine">went straight to my heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You seem very much surprised, dear friend."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was, for never had I imagined the possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such miracles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And yet--" she said earnestly--"these are noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but visible demonstrations, showing that the laws</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Nature can be used and exercised by those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have developed and unfolded the faculties, capacities</seg><seg type="columnLine">and powers of the soul. You and your friends--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">her graceful gesture indicated the professor "--can</seg><seg type="columnLine">do these things that we have done, if you will but</seg><seg type="columnLine">comply with, and live according the constructive laws</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Nature."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was not the end of wonders yet. Ealara</seg><seg type="columnLine">896</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">waved her hand respectfully in the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loalio. "Watch!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The venerable master rose and with both hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">traced an outline in the atmosphere, beginning at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of his eyes and tracing downward with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroking motion a number of times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gradually a large oval form appeared in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him, luminous and tinted with all the colors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rainbow. Rapidly the oval form became more</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense, apparently drawing together and concentrat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, until the outlines of a human form became</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again I noted the light of intense mental and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiritual power radiating from the eyes of the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wisdom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, even while we two earth dwellers</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched in utter fascination, there suddenly stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us, smiling at us sweetly, the form of a maiden</seg><seg type="columnLine">of eighteen summers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the rhythm of inaudible music she began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance in the most graceful manner imaginable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Faster and faster she danced, until soon she spun</seg><seg type="columnLine">dizzily on one slender toe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And then, even as she had appeared, she resolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the mysterious nothingness from whence</seg><seg type="columnLine">the master had called her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was a beautiful rest room to which we had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">personally conducted by Eloli and Ealara. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere within reminded one of the refreshing</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent of a pine forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In common with all other apartments in the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense edifice, the chamber was very spacious and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost devoid of furniture, other than two very com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable couches and a table, exquisitely carved from</seg><seg type="columnLine">some rare wood. The walls of the room were painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with wondrously artistic realistic designs of trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers and birds that seemed to live.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The peculiar feature in all these chambers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace was the lack of windows, or any other exterior</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings. Yet the light and ventilation were perfect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the two Rulers had embraced us in true</seg><seg type="columnLine">brotherly fashion, and bidden us to rest well, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor and I sat down on our couches and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussed the many strange happenings of the day. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">long after T heard his first breath of deep sleep, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still awake. The day had been too crammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with unbelievable adventures to allow of sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. I began to think about the Pluonian prisoners. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not seen any of them, but Alam, the chief of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alanian army, had casually mentioned that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">confined somewhere in a subterranean chamber of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently the overwhelming desire to inspect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners took possession of me. Very quietly, so as</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to awaken my companion, I rose and left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The passage in which I found myself led to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide descending stairway. On past the corridor be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, in which the banquet hall and music room were</seg><seg type="columnLine">located, I went. Just below this corridor the stair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way developed into a spiral.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was strangely still in the palace. Not the slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est sound could be heard, and my footsteps, however</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly I trod, seemed unnaturally loud. No doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone was asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At last 1 came to another passage, more like a tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel, far underground. And as I entered it, I experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enced a sudden dread, but with angry pride I sup-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed the emotion as childish. Boldly I entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carved out of the solid granite, no doubt with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful magic of Loalio and other wise men, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage seemed to lead into interminable dim dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tances, illuminated by the ubiquitous violet radiance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At regular intervals doors on both sides led to un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known regions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 passed on and suddenly was sensible of the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of living beings somewhere close by. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite a heavy door of metal. From beyond it</seg><seg type="columnLine">harsh, animal-like sounds, guttural and menacing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to my ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I should have turned back then, but the devil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity within me persisted. Cautiously, 1 placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">mv hand upon the massive latch and pressed down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a slight grating sound, the heavy metallic door</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung open. The next moment I staggered back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward with sudden fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For there, from behind the grating of thick metal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic bars, the face of a green-eyed devil stared out at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, terrible, repulsive; a Pluonian prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ashamed of my temporary fear, I summoned all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the courage at my command and faced the ape-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairy savage, beyond whose body I could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms of others of his kind--grinning, ferocious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A voice of warning within my consciousness bade</seg><seg type="columnLine">me slam the outfer door and go back to my couch</seg><seg type="columnLine">above. But I would not listen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flaming green eyes of the Pluonian at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grating attracted my gaze with the force of a magnet</seg><seg type="columnLine">attracting iron particles. I felt a rapidly increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbness in my brain, my senses began to reel. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flash it came over me that the savage was exerting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his terrible volitionary force to overcome me. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">all my remaining will-power I struggled desperately</seg><seg type="columnLine">to resist the dread influence sweeping over me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was of no avail. I felt myself slipping rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly. And then, like a white-hot bullet into my brain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the mental command of the Pluonian: "Open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grating!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dimly T realized that T must not yield, must not</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry out that command. But seemingly without my</seg><seg type="columnLine">volition my body responded. Like an automaton I</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised the heavy bar of metal that closed the grating</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly T felt myself flung aside with resistless</seg><seg type="columnLine">force, as evil-smelling bodies rushed past me, hairy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible. T had the sensation of being picked up--</seg><seg type="columnLine">then blackness descended upon my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH the sensation of regular rhythmic motion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness came back to me. I was lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the shoulders of a huge Pluonian, bound hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and foot, who carried me without apparent effort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All about me was the guttural growling, and the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramping of many bare-footed men. We were pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through dense primeval forests. Through occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional openings in the heavy foliage far overhead I</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpsed the rosy sky, and knew that it was early</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, as from my recumbent position T gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about cautiously. I saw that which turned my heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">and soul sick with horror. For there, just a few feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of me two of the savages carried a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammock which depended from the strong long pole</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their heavily muscled shoulders, and from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammock protruded an arm of ivory whiteness, most</seg><seg type="columnLine">BELOW THE INFRA RED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">897</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">beautifully modelled, and a long slender hand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would know anywhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE WOMAN IN THE HAMMOCK WAS EALARA!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ealara the beautiful, a prisoner of the semi-human</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage Pluonians! God! What had 1 done! Bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terly I regretted my damnable curiosity. But right</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and then I resolved to save Ealara no matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the cost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cords on my wrists and ankles hurt terribly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that pain was as nothing compared to the tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in my soul. No doubt she was asleep when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages had attacked her; because as Eloli had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained to us, psychical dominion through the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of will is far easier during sleep, for then there is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">active will to overcome. Perhaps it had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very savage who had dominated me, and had induced</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to open the prison, who had overcome her. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unquestionably a leader among the Pluonians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and therefore more powerful mentally than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hours passed, and still the steady tireless march</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the animal-men continued. And ever my gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to that white, beautiful arm protruding</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the portable hammock ahead of me, swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a pendulum, lifelessly, until I thought that 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">should go insane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the occasional glimpses upward through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense foliage I knew that it was broad daylight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet, in the depths of that strange, dense prime-</seg><seg type="columnLine">val forest, a sort of perpetual twilight prevailed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite my soul torment I must have fallen into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a doze, from which I awakened as we neared our</seg><seg type="columnLine">destination. From ahead, savage guttural cries and</seg><seg type="columnLine">piercing yells assailed my ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently we entered a clearing, at the foot of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high black cliff wall, along the base of which I per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived a number of irregular openings, the largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">being near the middle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment we were surrounded by a great mob</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nude savage children of all ages, and sullen semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nude Pluonian women, who stared at me fiercely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though there was something akin to awe in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of my clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The huge savage who had carried me tossed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground like a sack of meal. The impact jarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">every bone in my body, but it cleared my head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickened my brain. Disregarding the mob of sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages crowding about me, I exerted myself tremend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously and managed to sit up. Thus I was just in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to see the hammock, with Ealara, being carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the largest cave opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dear God !--" I prayed in my heart, "--help me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remedy the evil I have done; aid me to free</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ealara 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was lying, or rather sitting upon a white crystal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line ledge of rock that somewhat seemed familiar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I allowed myself to sink down again, twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, and touched my tongue to it experimentally.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I had guessed, it was pottassium nitrate : but of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such purity as I had never seen on the earth plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this moment the savage who had carried me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned, roughly pushed the crowd of women and</seg><seg type="columnLine">children aside, and cut the bonds from my ankles</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a short stone knife which he carried. He jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">me brutally to my feet and pushed me ahead of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the main cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several feet within the entrance a great double</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtain of very heavy cloth obstructed our progress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">My guard parted the curtains at the middle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed me through, following at my heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Involuntarily I recoiled, stepping hard on the toes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Pluonian behind me, who emitted an animal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like yell, for the intense red luminosity of the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to me for a moment a conflagration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The immense cave had been hollowed out by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand of Nature, and only in a few places was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">any sign of the touch of man. The walls had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinted with a luminous, bright-red substance as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">up as the eye could see, and this was accentuated a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousandfold by hundreds of fiercely burning torches</seg><seg type="columnLine">that threw an intense red glare. Everywhere, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls and in tall metallic holders, the red torches</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissed and spluttered and glared, illuminating a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene truly infernal, hellish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH a fierce growl, my guide pushed me for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward violently, so that I almost fell. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, as I walked forward totteringly, I became con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of other things in that vast cavern-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A large crowd of Pluonian warriors were assem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled about a great throne of a yellow, dully gleaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance, shaped like a huge square block, upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which sat a powerfully built savage, cross-legged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the exception of a broad breechcloth of shiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloth and fiery red color, and a sort of turban of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same material, he was nude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind the throne, sculptured out of black stone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its large, fiery eyes of a substance akin to ruby,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatted a gigantic idol, staring straight ahead with</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror-inspiring intensity, its triangular tongue of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson protruding several inches from the horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">gash of a mouth, its unspeakably hideous face grin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, grinning--a veritable nightmare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just below the throne was a wide stone platform,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on this my searching eyes perceived the motion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less white figure of a woman. "Ealara!" I cried and</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted to rush forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But with a crushing grip, my guide grasped my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and flung me to my knees. "Down, worm !"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he bellowed. "You are in the presence of.Turum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">son of Uruom that was, King of Pluonia!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Timidly I raised my gaze to the bestial, sinister</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence above me and met the brooding, fixed stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his flaming, reddish eyes, the menace and evil in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which caused quivers of terror to travel up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down my spine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a tremendous effort of will, I managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remove my gaze from the terrible fascination of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming eyes, and again contemplated the inert form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the white queen on the platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My heart turned sick within me at my absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">helplessness.

I loved Ealara!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loved her with every fibre of my being; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of doom filled me with utter despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sank to my knees, and prayed with an intensity</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I somehow felt would bring results. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new hope and renewed strength I rose to my feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as one of the Pluonians entered with a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">platter of food, and a stone pitcher of some liquid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He placed the food upon a block of the same yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance of which the throne in the main cave was</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed, grinned at me evilly, and walked out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a sudden realization of my hunger, I at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked the food.

At first I ate rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">reluctantly, but when I found the food surprisingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">palatable, I literally gorged myself, washing it down</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an occasional draught of water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I was eating I noted that the stony block</seg><seg type="columnLine">which served me as table and chair simultaneously</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocked back and forth with my movements.

Cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously, I peered around the turn. Just inside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer opening, so that he could see what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on in the main cave, a huge, bestial Pluonian</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His back was toward me. Silently I crept back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the grotto. With a dim hope, I began a tour</seg><seg type="columnLine">of exploration. The grotto was very irregular,</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed from the black cliff of evident volcanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">origin, with many ramifications. It seemed discour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aging, just as I was about to give up hope, my dili-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gent search was amply rewarded, for in the narrow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est of these branches of the grotto, I came upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine outcrop of the nitrate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the aid of my dinner knife, I managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break off a large quantity of the mineral and carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to a dish-like cavity in the stone floor, which acted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as my mortar. In a few moments', I had found an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblong piece of rock that was suited for a pestle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feverishly, I set to work grinding the nitrate to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine powder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING my grinding operation, I began to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vise ways and means for obtaining the requisite</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of charcoal. At one side of the grotto was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of heavy mat, woven from grasses. No doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was to be my bed. I concentrated upon this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mat, determined that it should furnish me with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary amount of charcoal. There were two</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming red torches against the walls of the grotto.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At intervals, glowing pieces dropped from them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor, where they remained in a glowing state</seg><seg type="columnLine">for quite a while. Quickly I walked over and pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mat squarely under one of the torches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How many hours I worked, I do not know, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">I lost all sense of time. But I now had many pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of powdered nitrate and sulphur, and through care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful manipulation, nearly the entire upper side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">straw mat was reduced to charcoal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was completely exhausted. Wearily, I dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself to the mat, turned it over so that the charred</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface was under me, and stretched out on it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest a little. When I awoke with a start hours later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found that another meal had been served me while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I ate voraciously, and as soon as I had finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">my meal, I began the milling operation again. Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral times I crept to the turn in the passage to spy</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my guard and found that at intervals of sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral hours new men were at the post. Evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were certain I could not escape, for not once</seg><seg type="columnLine">did anyone enter the grotto to see what I was doing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I praised heaven for that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly a weird feeling came over me, as if an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseen presence were approaching. And even as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared incredulously before me, there formed a tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oval fog-like phenomenon, growing more luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">every minute. I sprang to my feet and retreated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in alarm. And then, as I watched in amazement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there quickly materialized before me, out of thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">air--Loalio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled benignly and extended his hands to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward me in a tranquilizing gesture. "Fear not, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend! I have come to aid you." He pointed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. "As you no doubt understand, this is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">my physical body, even as yours is not. As master</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the laws of nature, I am able to leave my physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">body whenever I choose, and can travel to any dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance and there clothe myself in a temporary body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed of electro-magnetic and vito-chemical sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance, which is everywhere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I marveled. What wonders were possible to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul of man! Then I quickly acquainted Loalio</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the vital facts of the case, and showed him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">half finished gun-powder. He smiled gravely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently shook his head. "There is.no need for that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are greater forces than chemicals that are</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed into gases through fire or percussion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked over to me and touched my forehead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Immediately I seemed to expand all over my body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">BELOW THE INFRA RED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">899</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and experienced a far greater buoyancy than any I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had yet possessed. 1 glanced down at my body, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a shock realized that I was again invisible, as on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the daj' before, when Professor Winter and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered into this strange world. But in a few mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments my vision had become adjusted to the higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration of my body and I could again see both my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own body and that of Loalio, who had again made</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself invisible to ordinary vision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a sign, he invited me to follow him. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed right by the guard of the grotto unnoticed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was no doubt evening when we entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main cave, like two invisible spirits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turum was being entertained. At the foot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulphur throne a large crimson cloth had been spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the stone floor, and the most conspicuous thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this improvised table was an immense wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">platter, placed in the very center, in which lay an</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire huge ox-like animal, evidently freshly roasted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it was smoking hot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At each end the great roast was flanked by smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">platters containing smaller roasts, and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still other huge dishes containing heaps of the thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">white boiled root that I myself had eaten; and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were many other unknown edibles in great quantities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great jugs of stone contained liquid refreshment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the middle of the spread, with his back toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throne, Turum presided. At each side of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and surrounding the cloth, his warrior chiefs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoying themselves; everywhere about the immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber similar but simpler spreads were placed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the warriors--at least two thousand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Table manners were evidently unknown, for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were feeding like a pack of hungry wolves. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">method was simple. The warriors grasped a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venient corner of the roast in front of them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand, while with the stone knife in the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">they hacked off whatever they deemed immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And while the meal was in progress there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">music and dancing. And such music! And such</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing! Seated cross-legged, crouching like great</seg><seg type="columnLine">simians, and in various recumbent positions, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bestial warriors fed and watched the show.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At one side, to the right of Tarum, was a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone platform, and on this, accompanied by a hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible discordant blatant noise which could hardly be</seg><seg type="columnLine">called music, were seven men and seven women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying, whirling and gyrating in a series of mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions and postures that were vile and obscene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The orchestra, composed of reed pipes, great ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal horns, and various kinds of drums, was seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one edge of the platform. If anyone can imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">the combined noise and barbaric discord of a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese orchestra, a dozen Scotch bagpipes com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely out of tune, and a few African tom-toms, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can about imagine the effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole scene, the musicians, the glistening</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairy bodies of the dancers, the feeding warriors, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guttural deep ape-like tones of approval and shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of delight, and the crimson bright light tinging every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing with a blood-red color, might well have repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented a part of the infernal regions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That horrible crowd resembled the legendary de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mons of hell, as no other creatures could have done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only a few minutes we stood there contemplating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nauseating spectacle. Then my venerated com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion touched my arm and pointed to the throne of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulphur behind the savage king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked and my heart leaped. For there upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great block of sulphur, bedded on shining crim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son cloth which vividly accentuated her angelic</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiteness, I saw the object of my, adoration and</seg><seg type="columnLine">love--Ealara.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UNSEEN and unheard by the savages we quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached the throne, and bent over her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious concern. Apparently she was still in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip of the hellish power which during her sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">had robbed her of her consciousness and self-con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a shudder I realized that she would be held</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus until she had become the plaything of Turum</seg><seg type="columnLine">that very night. Loalio bent down and touched her</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead with the tips of his fingers of his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. With great joy I soon realized that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendered her physical body invisible to the savages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both he and I, however, could see her spiritual body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as we were able to see each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And even as I picked my love up in my arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the command of the wise man and carried her</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the entrance, a great shout went up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pluonians. They had suddenly discovered that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair prisoner was missing from the throne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment the place was in an uproar, an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferno of sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Agitated and driven on by the terrible booming</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Turum's voice, a frantic search was begun, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tending to every nook and corner of the vast cavern.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Torches were torn from their fastenings in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to facilitate the hunt for the missing royal prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And through it all, serene in our invisible condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, Loalio and I quickly made our way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screened entrance. We had barely reached it when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden thought evidently struck Turum, that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some unaccountable manner the royal fugitive might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made her way out of the main entrance, for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellow directed the searchers in that direction, him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self leading.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Loalio suddenly raised his arms upward with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving motion. For a moment there was a terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmospheric tension. Then, when the savages were</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a few yards of the entrance, a sudden ava-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanche of rock descended upon them with a terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar, burying them from our sight. A wild horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">yell from a thousand savage throats, and then--</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we stepped out into the open, the venerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">master touched the rock at the side of the entrance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again I witnessed the phenomenon of rock changing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a cloud of floating molecules, light as breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cloud phenomenon, now luminous, covered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire entrance. Quickly it grew more dense, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the luminosity disappeared, I stared in awe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where a couple of minutes before had been a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening, a solid smooth wall of hard impenetrable</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock confronted us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the many smaller caves a multitude of older</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, women and children emerged, streaming to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the former opening to the central cave. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as we, invisible to them, moved away, the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">was filled and made hideous by their piercing animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries and shrieks of astonishment, fear and hatred</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they saw the solid rock closing up the former</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance and simply realized perhaps that something</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange and terrible had entombed their king and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his warriors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Loalio gazed at them a few moments and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">900</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">face was stern as he spoke: "It was a terrible thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do, but I had no choice in the matter. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have declared war against Alania at once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and perhaps thousands of innocent people would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had to suffer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was still carrying my unconscious love in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, and was wondering if Loalio would awaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">her from her trance before we continued on our</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, when he stopped and looked at me. "Fear not</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you are about to experience, but trust me</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without hesitation, I nodded in acquiescence. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed his right arm firmly about my shoulders, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again his face assumed the fixed intent expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of intense concentrated mental power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next moment I felt myself rising high into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, and traveling with inconceivable speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> According to terrestrial time the phenomenon en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dured barely more than a minute or two. I distinctly</seg><seg type="columnLine">got the impression of dark forests, open spaces and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivers receding beneath me in a blurred, lightning-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lik^ procession, but was not conscious of wind or</seg><seg type="columnLine">impact against the air. And then--suddenly, I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid ground beneath my feet. I landed softly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">down once more in the garden of the palace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alania.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elolio and Professor Winter evidently had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected our coming, and greeted us with sincere de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. They wanted to relieve me of my precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">burden, but I insisted on carrying Ealara myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her own simple chamber of rest, where Loalio</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke the evil power which had held her in its grip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly she opened her wonderful eyes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed in bewilderment, first at me and then at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. A smile transformed her face into tran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scendent beauty as she raised herself to a sitting pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What has happened? Why are all of you act-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing so strangely?" she inquired. Evidently she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then it was that I sank to my knees, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with humbly bowed bead, told of my curiosity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its fatal consequences, and begged her pardon fpr my</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemptible lack of self-control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Softly she placed her hands upon my bowed head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her voice was like the sweetest music in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears. "My dear, dear friend; it was but a passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakness on your part. Who am I to condemn</seg><seg type="columnLine">you for it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When at last I dared to raise my head and gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">timidly into her eyes, I saw such a light of tender-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and love radiate from her eyes, that I forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything but my great love for her; and on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crest of the tidal wave of my emotion, I swept her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very willing prisoner, into my arms.

At last</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had found my soul-mate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long we were there in that embrace of utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">bliss, I do not know--it might have been minutes,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it might have been hours, days or eons. Then sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly an unutterable darkness descended upon my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, and I had the sensation of falling, falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a limitless void; I seemed to hear the cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my love's fear from an infinite distance, and then--</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblivion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt;&lt;T)ARTON!

I had been lying on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor in front of the great mechanical chair from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had started on my strange voyage to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land below the infra-red, from which I had evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other side of me, supporting me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling hands, was Summer, the old factotum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the professor, whose staring eyes and pale face</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicated that he had passed through an experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">of intense fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What had happened?

T stam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered feebly, while they helped me to a comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair.

EVANS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A SHORT time after the demise of my dearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">esteemed life-long friend. Professor Carl</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winter, his servant, Carl Summer, who, pend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the settlement of the professor's estate, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">left in charge of the latter's residence, called me up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the telephone, and begged me to hurry over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, as something very terrible had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I arrived, Summer, who was in a mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">state bordering upon collapse, conducted me to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">library, where I found Mr. John Barton, a friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the professor, with whom he had conducted some</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret experiments of importance, seated in a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair of peculiar'mechanical construction, in an at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titude which at once indicated to me that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had on a head-dress which resembled an avi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor's cap, with exceptionally heavy goggles. A num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of wires ran from- the front and sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap to a complicated apparatus at his right hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a table of very massive construction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were two of these chairs and mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables. The old servant pointed to the apparatus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was positive intense hatred in his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice as he cried:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a devil machine, sir! And it killed both</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Winter and his friend !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My immediate thorough examination corroborated</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond all doubt my first conclusion that Mr. Barton</seg><seg type="columnLine">was really dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Summer, upon being questioned, stated that Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton had that day come and had immediately gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the library. A few minutes later the old servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard him start the machinery on the table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Having a premonition of disaster, he had crept to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the closed door and had tremblingly listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly there had been a loud shriek from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery, and a horrible groan from Barton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wrenching open the door, Summer had rushed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and had pulled out the main switch on the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he knew controlled the machinery. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been too late. Something had gone wrong with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machinery, and it had cost Barton his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The very next day I received a bulky registered</seg><seg type="columnLine">package by mail from Barton, dated a day earlier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The package included a manuscript and a letter which</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained many things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently Barton knew that he was going to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, for he had left his entire fortune to charity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and before his fatal experiment, had written the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire manuscript, in compliance with the dying re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quest of my friend, Professor Winter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In his letter to me, Barton requested me to publish</seg><seg type="columnLine">902</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the manuscript he had written, and told me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was going to try to reach his soul mate, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman he loved on the plane below the infra-red.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have carried out the request as a sacred trust</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to both Barton and my dear friend, Professor Win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, and must let the world judge the merit or</seg><seg type="columnLine">demerit of the case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">(Signed) Frank Evans, M.D.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE END</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROBUR THE CONQUEROR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          By Jules Verne</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              (Concluded from page 849)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there by several peaks, lost in the snows that bounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaning against the fore-cabin, so as to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">their places notwithstanding the speed of the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they watched these colossal masses, which seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be running away from the aeronef.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Himalayas, evidently," said Phil Evans;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and probably Robur is going round their base, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to pass into India."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So much the worse," answered Uncle Prudent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"On that immense territory we shall perhaps be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Unless he goes round by Burmah to the east, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nepaul to the west."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anyhow, I defy him to go through them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Indeed!" said a voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day, the 28th of June, the Albatross</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in front of the huge mass above the province</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Zang.

I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been reading Amazing Stories since the first issue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indeed, it is the only fiction magazine that I read</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularly. Wild west stories and the old thread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare love plots long ago ceased to thrill me. I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan searching for "out-of-the-ordinary" stories in</seg><seg type="columnLine">libraries and in the current magazines. I soon read</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of Wells, Verne, Defoe, Poe and the few other</seg><seg type="columnLine">older classic writers of this type # of story and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began wishing that some enterprising editor would</seg><seg type="columnLine">publish a magazine featuring this kind of story.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amazing Stories is a very satisfactory materializa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of this wish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have just finished reading Ray Cummings'</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Around the Universe" and found it not only enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining but artistic in the extreme from the stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of short story technique. The dream character</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sir Isaac impersonating the well-known writers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scientifiction was entirely pleasing. However, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to me that Mr. Cummings overstepped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounds of good science--or even dream scicnce--</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he placed a solid encompassing shell about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom. To have had the Professor, Tubby and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ameena plunge into the realm of Empyrean Fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old Ptolemaic theorists would have been just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as scientific. But no matter, Mr. Cummings suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded in t putting over some good lessons in</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomy in a little more pleasing language than</seg><seg type="columnLine">one usually finds in textbooks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of all the stories published in our magazine to</seg><seg type="columnLine">date I liked Serviss' "The Second Deluge" best.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Being an astronomer myself in a more or less ama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teurish sort of way, I know Mr. Serviss as an au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thority on modern astronomy, as well as a weaver</seg><seg type="columnLine">of charming tales. At least one such serial a year</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the pen of Mr. Serviss would greatly enhance</seg><seg type="columnLine">the value of the magazine to me. I think the read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers are also fortunate in getting the new stories of</seg><seg type="columnLine">II. G. Wells--as well as his older stuff. I consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Wells one of the most far-sighted thinkers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our age. His ability to forecast scientific progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">and achievement of the future is almost uncanny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as evidenced by some of his older scientifiction</seg><seg type="columnLine">novels, such as "When the Sleeper Awakes" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The War in the Air," and short stories like</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Armageddon," "In the Days of the Comet," etc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only one story has appeared in Amazing Stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far that I could not seem to like. That was "Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dust." In fact, I much prefer stories like "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Visitation," in which the whole theme is optimistic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the destiny of the human race is painted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter colors. Don't we see enough of the morbid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in real life without bringing it too forcibly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiction? After all, isn't it just as probable that an</seg><seg type="columnLine">invading race from Mars or Venus would bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">good to the world as bad?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Please give us more Fourth Dimensional stories.</seg><seg type="columnLine">T consider this one of the most interesting subjects</seg><seg type="columnLine">of modern science. Relativity and the Fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dimension have already radically changed our scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific thought. What our ideas and conceptions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the universe will be one hundred years hence no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one can say, but it is a safe bet such conceptions</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be molded to a great extent by relative and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultra-three-dimensional mathematics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In closing may I repeat that Amazing Stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">fills a long felt want in my reading diet. May it</seg><seg type="columnLine">prosper and grow far into the future of which its</seg><seg type="columnLine">authors dream.

Much as the publishers of the magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would like to do this, and there is no doubt that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they could secure sufficient material, surely it would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hardly be practical inasmuch as the magazine is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hardly two years old, contains so few advertise-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ments, and is not vet paying for itself, if I under-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stand this correctly. I am quite sure that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">publication of Amazing Stories once a month is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">really remarkable, considering the difficulties it had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to start out with and is still encountering.

SUGGESTIONS FOR REPRINTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Editor, Amazing Stories:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having perused each number of Amazing Stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">from cover to cover since the first issue, I feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">entitled to offer some criticisms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The binding of the magazines in recent months</seg><seg type="columnLine">is disgraceful. I save my copies but am hindered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the fact that they fall apart before half read.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Please use a binding that will hold the book together</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 1 am sure that a great many readers will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the better pleased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another thing that I find abominable is the illus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trations. I am in favor of plenty of pictures, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not such lifeless and inanimate imitation cartoons</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as you have been using. They don't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">look like drawings of statues. You should get an</seg><seg type="columnLine">artist who would put a little life in his sketches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The authors are good but somewhat overdone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">II. G. Wells is a big favorite with me but you</seg><seg type="columnLine">overexploit him. You have not printed an issue</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet that failed to contain some Wells. Give some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one else a chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Merritt is good but too imaginative. Give us</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that is more in line with known science.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Verne stories are all right but they sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">too old and have too much of a dry journalistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">flavor. I won't weep if you drop him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keep Burroughs out of Amazing Stories. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">is too imaginative and entirely too romantic, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not much real science. Am getting sick of reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a m3n going to some other planet, or to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the earth, or to some forsaken jungle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">always to find the same thing--some "beauty'</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the savages. I have read wholly or partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">every story that Burroughs has written before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew better, and find him to be the most magnificent</seg><seg type="columnLine">liar I have seen in print.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cummings also has an abominable habit of going</seg><seg type="columnLine">into out-of-the-way places for his heroines. Once or</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice is all right, but for the love of Pete, make</seg><seg type="columnLine">it the rule to keep 'em on the earth. They sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little too improbable away from home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The comic invention stories are poor. Too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">.stress is laid on the humor part with the result</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the tales get quite ridiculous. They are noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing more than rank imitations of Edgar Franklin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">old "Hawkins" stories of 24 years ago anyway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If these tales were dropped, I'll bet that the circu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation would advance enormously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How about shaking up the bag a little so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could get a few new stories? The reprints arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">very good, but yo i should give the other stories a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. This kick is aimed at the longer stories.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would be much better if you at least alternated</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new serial with an old one. Of 19 issues you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have put out to date, and the Annual, only two</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers have been completely new to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Speaking of reprints, I should like to suggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few that I should be glad to meet again. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Planeteer" and its sequel, "King of Conserve</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island" are the best interplanetary stories I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever read. Thev were in All-Story Weekly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1917-18 and could easily be run in two issues.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Brain Blight" and "The House of Sorcery"</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Jack Harrower (All-Story, 1913) arc also very</seg><seg type="columnLine">good. "Unsight-Unseen" (All-Story, 1912) is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholesome huYnor story and as good an invisibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">story as I have seen. I should especially like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see "The Mastodon-Milk-Man" by C. Mac Lein</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Savage, as I never read its conclusion. Edgar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Franklin's "The Amiable Aroma" is another good</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific humor yarn. How about "The Blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spot" by Austin Hall and Homer Eon Flint?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip M. Fisher has also written a couple of good</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones, which are short. "The Powder of Midas"</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Ben Ames Williams belongs in Amazing Stories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Prof. Serviss seems to have published a story</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere in 1898, entitled "The Conquest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars." I have been unable to trace this story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but should like to read it. Could you give me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little assistance in finding this story somewhere?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You have added a good author in Garrett Smith.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have read some of his stories and they are very</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The suggestion of a Scientific Club is very good</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it would be a great thing were its purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There should be in cither Science and Invention</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Amazing Stories a page devoted to a scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem or theory.

He likes Burroughs, Wells,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and Ray Cummings, and we are glad to see that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their work has excited his imagination to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">degree of making him a critic of the possibilities</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the various statements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We firmly believe that if our stories were solid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">matter of fact they would cease to be "Amazing"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--and people like to be amazed.--EDITOR.]</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN EXPLANATION FROM ONE OF</seg><seg type="columnLine">OUR AUTHORS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Editor, Amazing Stories:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Being a Burroughs admirer I rather resented</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">those people who "knocked" him because of his so-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">called hatred of the Germans.

"The Moon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pool" is, in my estimation, one of the best stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you have published. The author's power of inter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">esting and enthralling description, as well as nar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ration, was exceptionally good. "The Second Del-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">uge" was another fine story. I don't like the grue-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some tales very well, but they are all right in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moderation. I enjoyed "Around the Universe," even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if it is a reprint. I have no fault to find with any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of your reprints. The "Treasures of Tantalus"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had me very delicately balanced on the front edge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of my chair, and the Discussions Column is a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">source of real enjoyment. I'm going to talk a little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to both you and your correspondents now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I agree with Mr. Lucy of Palo Alt# in his com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment on the "critics" who seem disappointed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">think that they can find flaws in the stories. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">author has to have a joker in the deck or he would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be accused of everything from insanity to treason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Furthermore, if the stories were true they would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be in the newspapers and would be quite common</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">potatoes. It puts me in mind of those who "view</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with alarm" the Atlantic and Pacific flights, calling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them the exploits of "fools." (I refer to the suc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cessful ones.) It makes me think of some other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fools like the Wright brothers and so on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I have always had much the same ideas that Mr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Hale of California has, although I never dared air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them for fear of ridicule. A person is truly pos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sessed of a wonderful conceit if it will allow them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to declare that this dust speck of an earth is the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only inhabited world in the universe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I am much amused at Miss Moran's fearful pur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chase of the "cheap fiction," which she tells of in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the October issue. I am sorry to say that Amazing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Stories IS considered "cheap fiction" by a good</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">many people. If I may venture to, I will suggest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that your cover is responsible. I, mvself, find noth-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing wrong, but my friends have told me that if the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cover were a little less wild there would be less</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chance of people getting the "cheap fiction" impres-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sion. My mother also suggests better paper and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">illustrations on a par with the American Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and others of that type.

A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the marksmanship of the British artillery, Mi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Kiordan has an exaggerated opinion as to whs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Americans could do in like circumstanccs. Th«</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tanks in the last war were far slower object:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than the Martian machines, and yet the recor*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of direct hits was quite low. Even at a thousant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yards, you must get the range first, before yoi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cjui hope to hit your target. These Martians, ac</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">girding to Wells, retaliated with their heal ra&gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">before the range could be found. Their ray and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their poison gas, combined with their mobility,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">undoubtedly made them irresistible. Cortez ir</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mexico, and Pizarro in Peru never had such an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">overwhelming superiority in arms as these Mar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tians possessed in the story, and yet they conquered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">empires with actual handfuls of men. As fot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the description of the flight from Ixmdon, it is the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">best thing in the book. The disorganization of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">humanity, its frantic fear, its pell-mell rush from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the new terror, are all told so vividly that you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">forget you arc reading fiction. It helps to make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the story seem real. How many writers can do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There is one kind of story that depends on an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">utter fallacy. And that is the Fourth Dimension</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">story in which Time becomes tjie Fourth Dimen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sion. 1 think that Wells knew; it when he wrote</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The Time Machine." That is why he disposes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the reasoning which would seem to argue for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the possibility of moving in the future in a page</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or two, and tnen proceeds to tell you an engrossing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tale as to what might happen to humanity and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world in the incalculably remote future, A. Hyatt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Vcrrill, however has made the mistake of making</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the reasoning the story, with the result that his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">talc is a farrago of mathematical nonsense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mentiroso discovers that the reckoning of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hours is different all over the world, and from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that argues ingeniously in much the fashion that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ancient Pythagoreans argued. If you can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fly fast enough you will leave Calcutta on Tues-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">day and arrive in Peru on Monday. As a matter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of fact it is true that radio messages are sent on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tuesday and received on the previous Monday.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Send a message from London at one in the morn-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing of Tuesday and it will arrive in New York</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the previous Monday evening. But the fallacy lies</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the purely arbitrary ^division of the week and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the day. Mankind performs most of its miracles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by symbols. The year is determined by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earth's orbit, the day is determined by the earth's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rotation about its axis. The month, the week, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hour, the minute, and the second are purely ar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bitrary divisions. If time is different in two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">places it is because the difference was artificially</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">created by mankind. Suppose mankind had said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that instead of counting the hours according to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sunrise and sunset, the hours all over the world</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should be the same. Instead of the sun rising in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">New York at five o'clock it would rise at ten;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">instead of going to work at nine we would go to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">work at two. We should easily grow accustomed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to counting the hours differently, because we have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">already done it with one hour, our daylight saving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time in Summer. If the hours should be reck-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">oned the same the world over, what then becomes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Mr. VerriU's argument about jumping back in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time? As a matter of fact such a reckoning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would probably be more sensible than the present</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">confused method. We don't shift our months about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to suit the weather, why shift the hours about to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suit the light? If Mr. Verrill should take a trip</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the Argentine, he would find the trees blossom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing instead of losing their leaves, the flowers would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be budding, the insects humming, summer would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be about to begin, whereas with us it is ending.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Would he then say that he has travelled six</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">months into the future, or six months into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">past? If he would I should tell him to be his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">age. January isn't July in the Argentine because</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their January weather corresponds to our July</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weather. The time is the same, the weather is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">different. It is the same with daylight. The pres-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ent time is the same here and in Calcutta, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">light is different. No matter what your speed in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">travelling, time would be consumed, and you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would arrive in New York from Calcutta later,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and not earlier. The same time is called by dif-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ferent numbers in the two places, that is all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Another instance: Accordinp to Jewish chro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nology this is the year 5688. Should Mr. Vcrrill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">step into a synagogue, would he be 3700 years</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">older, because our reckoning says 1927? Absurd,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">isn't it? Why? Because both chronologies arc</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">artificial, and made for convenience of reckoning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It is just as absurd to say that a radio message</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">leaving England Monday evening and arriving in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">New York at noon Monday takes five hours less</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than nothing in time to get to its destination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Both times are artificially named for purposes of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">convenience. So if Mr. Verrill should step from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Russia where it would be November 1st into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Poland where it would be November 14th the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">same day. would he step into the future two weeks,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">because Russia follows the Julian Calendar, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Poland the Gregorian? The time is exactly the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">same, the labels are different in the two countries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All this talk of moving in the past and the fu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ture is fallacious. The theory seems to he that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">just as we see the light of stars hundreds and per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">haps thousands of years after those rays were sent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out. we can catch the past by the light that past</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">happenings made.
