Trouble sprang up at one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">actories. The men talked strike. Things looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">gly. Harry Winslow was sent to straighten it out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">in I he eve of a general walk-out he pacified the</seg><seg type="columnLine">non and headed off the strike. And not only this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tut ever since then, that factory has led all the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">or production. He was able to do this, because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">;new how to make these men like him and do what</seg><seg type="columnLine">le wanted them to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another case, entirely different, is that of Henry</seg><seg type="columnLine">'eters. Because of his ability to make people like</seg><seg type="columnLine">lim--his faculty for "getting under the skin" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">naking people think his way, he was given the posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion of Assistant to the President of a large firm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two other men, both well liked by their fellow em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">â¢loyees, had each expected to get the job. So when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he outside man, Peters, came in, he was looked upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">&gt;y everyone as an interloper and was openly disliked</seg><seg type="columnLine">&gt;y every other person in the office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peters was handicapped in every way.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">vhole secret is that he could tell in an instant how</seg><seg type="columnLine">:o appeal to any man and make himself well liked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A certain woman who had this ability moved with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler family to another town. As is often the case, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">s a very difficult thing for any woman to break into</seg><seg type="columnLine">-lie chill circle of society in this town, if she was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">tnown. But her ability to make people like her</seg><seg type="columnLine">toon won' for her the close friendship of many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "best families" in the town. Some people</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonder how she did it. It was simply the secret at</seg><seg type="columnLine">*ork--the secret of judging people's character and</seg><seg type="columnLine">naking them like you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*****</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YOU realize, of course, that just knowing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference between a blond and a brunet could</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot accomplish all these wonderful things.

I mention this because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a powerful politician and a candidate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the time this story ends, for governor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a man of powerful body, dominant</seg><seg type="columnLine">personality, robust and more vigorous at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty-five than most men in the earlier</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of manhood.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rather proud of having a reputationas"a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous man"; and yet, in all seriousness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I now encountered such a fellow as I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, I would very much want to spank</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I admit it would be risky, for I was then</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as good a shot as I am now; I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, as now, almost physiologically in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of being nervous or feeling fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The really brave man is like Marshal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ney, whom Napoleon called "the bravest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the brave."

But there was also a letter, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the envelope, of course, an address--Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary Curwen. The dope-fiend tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me what was in the letter. He offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to me to read. His words were rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumbled for he was half-drunk, but what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said was somewhat borne out by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">return address on the envelope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This miserable rat saw a chance for black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mail and was drunk enough to suggest that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I engage with him. The envelope was from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office of a congressman of the San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco district. The pickpocket said</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was written by Congressman Bryan--</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was just making an announcement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his willingness to run for governor--to Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary Curwen and that it spoke of a "dread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful secret."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not read the letter. As nearly as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could gather the "dreadful secret" was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed,but was suggested in some way that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to the pickpocket sufficient to es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tablish a basis for "a piece o' graft."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What that basis was he didn't exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. He urged me to read it. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very drunk, and I never quarrel with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunken man. I took the letter and put it</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside for a day or two. I was tantalizingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested and tempted to read it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is no shame in being tempted--it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving way to temptation that knocks the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner props down.

But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a quirk of what may possibly be called</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor which would let me as readily peep</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a woman's bedroom as read a letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">that does not concern me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I was intensely interested. Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressman Bryan was no political puppet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a comparatively young man and a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamic, hard-fighting, out-spoken fellow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant and courageous; a man-who seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have arisen by sheer work and brilliancy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Naturally I admired him. For one thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thrope and his party were against Bryan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I SHALL not give any particulars of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the political fight, for those details</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not concern the story. It so</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanced that Bryan's releection to Congress</seg><seg type="columnLine">had recently taken place, but he was willing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to resign and run for governor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">State needed an honest governor. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thrope should be elected, the skull-and-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossbones might as well have floated from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flagpole at Sacramento.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was to be a hard and bitter campaign.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It always was when Bryan and Thrope</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought. One of the features of the Bryan</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers' argument had always been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphasis laid on the fact that he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Francisco boy orphaned in babyhood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose whole life had been lived under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of San Franciscans who might examine</seg><seg type="columnLine">every feature of it and know that his record</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stainless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I told the purse-snatcher that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too drunk to have read straight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought of returning the letter to Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Curwen by mail; but, in case the letter did</seg><seg type="columnLine">contain any matter that would trouble her</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she knew it had passed under the eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers, she could not be reassured by</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything I might write to accompany the</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So I returned the letter in person.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The house was a modest, solid little home;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yard was well kept, the lawn fresh, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrubs trimmed, the paint new.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A young woman, neat and attractive--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is, intelligent of face as well as pretty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with a wilful set to her Ups--opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.

Bullies usually try to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces by scowls when they are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to venture further.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thrope half swung his hand toward his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hip. So far as he could see I was unarmed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he did not draw, or try to draw. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps he had heard--and believed--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumor that the reason I had never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried for any one of a few little gun-plays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was because I never made a move until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">became evident that I had to shoot in self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was perhaps a little truth in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">report, though much exaggeration. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">those days I used a single action .44--two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them--and I wore a double-breasted coat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't know whether automatics had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">invented or not; anyway they were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth considering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Colt is meant for quick work. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were worn, diagonally across my stomach</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carried cocked. That helped to culti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vate in me a slow, deliberate manner and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain unbending attitude--much as would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be cultivated in a man who carried dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mite in his pocket. All I needed to do to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot quick was to thrust my hand inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coat on a level with the stomach--</seg><seg type="columnLine">an entirely unsuspicious movement--and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-turning my body to point the gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">press the trigger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course I shot through the coat. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun was very awkward to carry there, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the awkwardness had compensations in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous moments. Thrope probably sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected that I would not be unagitated if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not feel secure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is fair, perhaps, to say that he may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have believed there were as many friends of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine as of his in the room; that the insult</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been planned, and that he was in a trap</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared beforehand. I offer that as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation, for, though Thrope was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trinsically a coward, he was proud and high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempered, and it hardly seems likely that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">--though even then men of stronger nerves</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Iris hesitated to take up my challenge--1</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have, by mere poise, so humiliatingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">have bluffed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lie cursed in the way of a man who does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not mean to fight, promised me sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">death at some future time, intimating that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would not be far distant, either; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrew with his friends, who glowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">over their shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The incident attracted much more at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention than the mere facts warranted; all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, because James Thrope was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of importance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it was not surprizing that Mrs. Cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wen knew of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The surprizing thing was the interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this quiet and lovely woman, grayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrinkled, showed in an incident of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenderloin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I SUGGESTED that it was strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">she should have paid so much at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention to a mere affair of the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derworld.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I know of Jim Thrope," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I must pause to tell as nearly as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can how she said it.

The "of" seemed forced into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentence, and "Jim Thorpe" was spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost in a whisper as if, only by overcom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a strong repugnance, could she speak his</seg><seg type="columnLine">name.

It doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">make any difference what the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A modest bet was made on my right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was up to me to call, raise or quit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I carelessly tossed my hand away--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the expression in Smith's eyes as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw me do it. I had wanted to see his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face--not his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I saw the hand anyway. Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw it away--face up--and disclosed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of tens. He had palmed whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">else had been used to strengthen the hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if indeed he had not relied on the fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">H</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to his right who took the pot without being</seg><seg type="columnLine">called. I saw Smith, however, dispose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the palmed cards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not see the cards, for one never</seg><seg type="columnLine">does when a skilful man has them, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually reached out and touched the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards, and when the hand was withdrawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were three cards, one precisely on</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of the other. Quite good--and inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dentally, I made a note for my own future</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit of the fact that one should never</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposit palmed cards in the discards without</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretending to gather the cards up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nobody would, with their eyes open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinarily go to the trouble of trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleece a professional gambler. But here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a frame-up of some kind. Had these</seg><seg type="columnLine">men learned that on the day before I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been given ten thousand dollars? Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney in on the deal, or had he too been</seg><seg type="columnLine">imposed on. Naturally the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodded my temper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The climax was delayed for some time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it came in an unexpected flash. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealing: both hands were engaged. Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">said--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're dealing from the bottom!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And a muzzle of his gun appeared above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a matter of fact, I had not been dealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bottom. I was caught unpre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared. There was nothing to do but sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless, hands across the table, holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck and a card that I had about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">toss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You tin-horn," he said, "will you leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">town by train or by hearse?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced right and left. The three</seg><seg type="columnLine">other men at the table showed no surprize.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had known what was coming. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been caught in a little frame-up. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed that Delaney knew of it and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted that I be given the chance to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is a peculiar psychology in crooks:</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew I had not been cheating; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that I knew I had not been cheating;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet they pretended to think I had so</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to have an excuse to order me out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not intend to go. I did not intend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to promise to go. I let the deck slip</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly, at the same time raising my hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sitting back in the chair--straightening</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with hands raised, symbolic of surrender.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had never advertized the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wore a gun across my stomach, for half</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the efficacy of the device and position was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fact that no one expected it to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. But I couldn't possibly reach for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">while covered. It would have been sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">idiocy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to the come-on who had intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced Smith into the game and said--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Search me--so I can drop my hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and talk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked inquiringly at Smith, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He removed the gun from my hip, ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand all around my trouser's band and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapped me right and left under the shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a shoulder holster. I sat with stomach</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn in to do something to keep the gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">from accidentally coming in contact with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers. He was satisfied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat down, lowered my hands and tapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">my fingers, moving them about with nerv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous gestures that I did not feel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now just what is the proposition?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A train or hearse--and that goes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hand lay on the table, circling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle of the revolver. A twist of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist and a pressure of the trigger was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that he need give. He had put the gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been taken from me into his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster. It was a good gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the table raised up, the round</seg><seg type="columnLine">top like a great buckler cutting me off mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentarily from Smith's eyes. But he fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway. The bullet splintered through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had had to use both hands to tilt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table between us. I had had to have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenth of a second of safety in which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach under the breast of my coat for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun. I don't care how subtle or quick a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man is, he can't move quicker than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow with the drop can pull a trigger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was afraid to try to slip my hand up</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the coat gradually, for suspicion</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be aroused and another search made.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it would have been inviting death to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made an abrupt gesture. And though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it took me longer to heave up that table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the gesture was more conspicuous, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was safer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Any one who doubts need only sit at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">table and try the two movements. Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">was used to men reaching for a gun: he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what that gesture meant, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment a hand flashed from sight he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have shot. But he was not used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables rising. Both my hands were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Born to be Hanged, But--	15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sight, the fingers above the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table--but the thumbs were not. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated to see what was happening, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot--too late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Delaney and some of the people in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saloon came on the bound, they found</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men facing my gun with hands lifted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man called Smith lay crumpled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp on the floor, face down--in a witch's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror of blood. Pie was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WAS cornered. The room had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows and but one door. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small room, a poker room, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one door was filled. Delaney stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it, a gun in either hand and behind him</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank on rank of men--risking their lives for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chance to crane a neck over the shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fellow in front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Spike," I said, "you've trapped me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shoot if you want to commit suicide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He might have been able to kill me--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not before a bullet would have been on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way toward him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started to speak, but I cut him short.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no time to lose. Quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply, I told him that if he did not want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to commit suicide to turn around, face the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd with leveled guns and clear a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me, for I was going to follow him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gun pressed against the small of his back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I let it be known that if anybody made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">move at me, I would get him, Delaney, first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spike Delaney turned his back and filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, and he put a lot of feeling into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words that he spoke to the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there would be three men behind my</seg><seg type="columnLine">back the moment my face was turned. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew they were armed--or at least I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out that they were not. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time to search.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Down on your knees and face that way,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said, indicating the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went down and grotesquely as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed an attitude of prayer. Perhaps they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were praying, as cowards do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I realized that after I took five</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps out into the saloon I would have even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more men behind me, some of whom would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be cowards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Step slow, Spike, and step carefully,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said and pressed my shoulders against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One gun, which I had recovered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith, I poked against Delaney's side; with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other I kept the people through whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">we passed, not covered exactly, but bluffed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spike was roaring right and left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't you see he'll kill me if you don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out of the way--get, you-!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spike was eloquent when aroused, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words were not choice. People in that part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the town were used to obeying Spike De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laney; and, too, none of those around about</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be friends of Smith's--and it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the police who go out of their way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight with the victor of a duel. So we got</seg><seg type="columnLine">through to the alley door safely enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God, that was a clever stunt!" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spike when we had cleared the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Drop those guns. Face about." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. "I never thought you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">double-cross me," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd 'a' shot quick," he said. "You'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">better go through. Keep up the bluff--</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me to beat it back toward the bar!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It dawned 011 me that Spike Delaney</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know that he lured me into a trap</seg><seg type="columnLine">by asking me to take the place of his house-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in that poker game, and I understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">why with so much alacrity he had cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way through the crowd for me: he wa?</seg><seg type="columnLine">gladly helping me make a getaway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was 110 time to parley so I sent him</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the bar and sprang through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alleyway door and was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Let some one who knows explain why it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that a gambler always carries all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money that he has. I do not know. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">only know that they all do it, and one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things I was long in getting used to was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">checking account.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My bank was my inside vest pocket. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">I happened to be pretty well capitalized,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I used both vest pockets and the hip. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money that I had was on me; and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">one is departing in a hurry that is the mnin</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew that I had to keep out of sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a while. The three witnesses had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">there ready to have sworn that Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">murdered me in self-defense; and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would as readily declare that I had shot him</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he wasn't looking. Such evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have convicted a more innocent</seg><seg type="columnLine">man than myself, a man with less powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">enmity directed at him from James Thrope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Delaney's friendship was valuable, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not without trouble for himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">have bucked a combination such as I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">up against. Besides, his regard for me wras</seg><seg type="columnLine">one only of friendship; his relation with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thrope and the police and judges was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of business.</seg><seg type="columnLine">i6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I was younger even than at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, I used to vow that I would never run,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never be a fugitive. I swore to stand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see it through--"it" being anything that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might happen. But I have run frequently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">far and fast. I ran that night--figuratively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, for nothing would so readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">have started pursuit as for me to have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen flying along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WENT down to the water-front</seg><seg type="columnLine">and poked about cautiously. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not want to be seen, that is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be noticed particularly, for I knew Thrope</seg><seg type="columnLine">would urge the police to "do their duty"</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he heard of what had happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I was not without a few friends scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered through the water-front saloons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have friends everywhere--I have always</seg><seg type="columnLine">had them every place. That does not mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am such a person as people are eager to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know and help, though outside of my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">family very few people have been ashamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have their names linked with mine; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I like friends, particularly I like the so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called outcasts, who are the best and most</seg><seg type="columnLine">loyal friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I try never to refuse any man a favor</seg><seg type="columnLine">so long as he is not up to some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">deviltry that even my slack code occasion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, but at such tunes rigidly, refuses to</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance. I was young in those days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and youth likes vivid phrases; so I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself that all of us, gamblers, crooks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one kind and another, belonged to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Legion of the Damned--and should go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">-together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have recovered a little from such</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginative crudities; but in doing so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have lost something irrecoverable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the zest of life. This flickering of remi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">niscence is intended to throw a little light</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the fact that the reason I hovered watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully that night at the rear of the Ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saloon was because the bartender then on</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch--as I could see by peeping through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door--was one Sam Tyler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam Tyler was a sailorman, who, recover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing consciousness after a free-for-all in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney's saloon, found himself not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty of pockets, but with a cracked head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and broken thigh. And because Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tyler, who was a stranger to me, had pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voked the fight, taken on all-comers, fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good fight and gone down without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmur to accept the savage punishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">that befalls the vanquished in a bar-room</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brawl, he went to the hospital--into</seg><seg type="columnLine">private room--and I paid the bill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His sheepish explanation, made from lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely visible amid a swathing of bandages</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been that he always ended a jag with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fight. But his forecastle days were over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctors said the thigh would always</seg><seg type="columnLine">be stiff and likely to cause pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he had settled down to the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parative quiet of night bartender at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ship Saloon, where he could get all the sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">news and keep in touch with old friends;</seg><seg type="columnLine">among whom, though I knew less of sailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a farm hand, he included me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three men were at the bar drinking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking. It took me some time to attract</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam's attention, but I was cautious because</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not want him to be embarrassed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next day when the police came asking after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man of my description, if witnesses should</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen to be around to call him a liar in</seg><seg type="columnLine">case he denied having seen me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Sam found, out whb it was and</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a suspicion of wny 1 was there, he set</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bottle of whisky on the bar, told his cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomers to help themselves and keep tab--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last as a perfunctory concession to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty--and came to the alley, standing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the half-closed door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him that I thought I needed a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told me that the Eliza Jane had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared the day before for Sydney; he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have put me on to her and no questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. The Northern Belle was due in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten days, and he and her skipper were old</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In my impatience, it seemed that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned every ship that had ever been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent down the ways to a baptism of salt</seg><seg type="columnLine">spray; it seemed that he knew ali about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her movements and the personnel of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew, who her skipper was and his char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acter, whether or not one could offer him</seg><seg type="columnLine">money for a "safe" passage. Such a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion of sea gossip was maddening--al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I kept an attentive pose. I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand what it meant. I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize that he was talking of his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">passion, the sea and her ships--the strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">passion of strong men: stronger than love</seg><seg type="columnLine">of women, for sailors leave women in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">port to sing the ho-heave-ho of the creaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">capstan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last he thought of what a normal man</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have thought of the first thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two of the three men in there drinking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Born to be Hanged, But--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the bar at that moment were off the Jessie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Darling--the mate and second officer they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, and waiting then for the captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Jessie Darling left at dawn.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tempted into this because they so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many times dropped their voices into fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive, loud whispers, and did so no doubt un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the impression that they were concealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they had to say from prying ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Caution and suspicion are two very im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant characteristics in my make-up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So when I chanced to hear the phrase</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"- old hypocrite" used in a way that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to refer to the captain, and im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">2</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately followed by a prophecy that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be "shown," I began to pay very</seg><seg type="columnLine">close attention, indeed, to the two mates</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the third party to whom they paid a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain deference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gathered a number of things; among</seg><seg type="columnLine">which that the Jessie Darling was likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to steer another course than that intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the owner--who was also to be shown a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing or two.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mates were the ordinary tough-fibered, big</seg><seg type="columnLine">breasted men of the sea, neither of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I judged, under thirty-five.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain came in.

Besides, atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion would be attracted to my own identity</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the Jessie Darling cleared the bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once the police had their hands on me</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would be in for a trial.

With that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">let Thompson go on his way--never to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard from again in my affairs--and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a launch and was taken out to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The launch man did not want to put out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lights and shut off his engine as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached the Jessie Darling, but a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">money is very persuasive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we came alongside a low voice hailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">us--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Thompson."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Righto," I answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had a speech ready in case the lookout</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew Thompson, but he didn't; that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious by the way he took it for granted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Swanson?"

A fine fellow to have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where was Thompson?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If he, Swanson, had not been drunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asleep when we came he might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, I was the man that had loafed</seg><seg type="columnLine">around in the Ship's bar. I was also the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who was a friend of the bartender's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was the man who had "something on"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thompson; and I had impressed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thompson the need of taking me into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game. Swanson was invited to notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Sam Tvler was on board; and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">invited to consider the matter of going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on with the game under the new deal or</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to get out and save his own hide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jn which case he would probably share</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fate of the captain of whom we mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tineers would soon dispose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lookout had not told him Thompson</seg><seg type="columnLine">came with me?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, the lookout hadn't. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookout knew nothing: he had said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate was asleep, and I had known that</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant in a drunken sleep, so the launch</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone back without Thompson coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">on deck. Thompson did not intend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come on deck anyway: he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained from the launch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mate was mystified: but when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed the maps, he realized that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">got pretty close into the confidence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thompson; and if I had not intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on with the plot, why had I not carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">my story straight to the captain?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My procedure was a bit irregular, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">effective. He was nervous, uneasy, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced. Besides, Swanson hated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What about Thompson?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I suggested that Thompson had seen fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sell out his interest in the plan to me;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that certain persuasions had been made</seg><seg type="columnLine">which appealed to Thompson as irresistible;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that whenever I saw a good thing, I natu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rally wanted to share.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it or is it not a go?" I demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed to think I had the cards</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty well stacked; besides he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to even a grudge against the captain, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he believed in the map. A sailor always</seg><seg type="columnLine">believes in a treasure-lrove map. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">one may liave been genuine for all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was never used. So, all things con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered, and perhaps convinced that I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be as firm a leader as Thompson, he declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was "a go," and offered his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I ignored the hand and told him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had better walk a straight line. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him angry, of course. But I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">better card up my sleeve than he suspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep him from trying to do away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and getting the maps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here," I said. "I know what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on inside your head. Here are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maps--three of them. I have copies. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have concealed them. When you find</seg><seg type="columnLine">them--the copies--it will be time to slug</seg><seg type="columnLine">me over the head and drop me over the side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But not before. Remember, the copies--</seg><seg type="columnLine">very accurately made--are all that is left."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that I struck a match and burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the maps under his nose, while his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung agape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are a half-dozen desperate fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows," I explained lest his slow brain did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully appreciate the peril in which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed him, "enlisted by Thompson on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this boat.

If they find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can't produce the maps, your life won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be worth a salted herring--and you can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce the maps if anything should</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen to me.

I don't think he noticed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could watch him very well out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners of my eyes in the' small mirror</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hung on the bulkhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I have said, I am very cautious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I seem to be taking a chance I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually playing safe--dealing from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He contained his anger and went out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I supposed he wished my soul on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">toasting fork of his satanic majesty's chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">cook, but Mr. Swanson had given himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little lesson in self-control. Perhaps he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not play poker, except in the crude</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw-and-bet manner of the win-or-be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken gambler, and so urffierstood nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the refinements of bluff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Chinese steward brought me</seg><seg type="columnLine">something for dinner. Withered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wise and rather old he was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I imperturbably tried further con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation with him, and received no</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer. He watched me with a steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny not at all reassuring--but one</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't tell what is reassuring, or ominous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a Chinaman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By night my hole had become unbearably</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearisome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chinaman visited me again.

However, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did nothing, said nothing, and went away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I waited until it was dark, then went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on deck to stretch my legs.

I was not afraid, but the need</seg><seg type="columnLine">for having left San Francisco did not seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">so pressing a score of leagues from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Golden Gate on a ship pledged to mutiny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was no easy matter to stretch my legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the moon was bright and dodged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out among the clouds in a way that</seg><seg type="columnLine">annoyed me.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew nothing of ships. I did not leam</seg><seg type="columnLine">much about the Jessie Darling either. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was kept too busy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I stood identifying myself as much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible with a mast shadow, I heard voices,</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited voices, aft, then a pattering of feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A figure scooted by me and shouted down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turn out an' search the ship.

Voices, harsh laughter and harder</seg><seg type="columnLine">jokes, rose in every direction; figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">scampered by, some with lanterns; calls</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang to and fro. From the poop-deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could hear the voice of Captain Whibley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Questions and answers and directions--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jokes--all around.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man came by and Hashed a lantern in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">face; it was the man who had been de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tailed by Swanson to let me--or rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thompson--on board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I made inquiries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said she rriust have jumped over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs are third on the list--though perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">children are first--of the things it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise to abuse if my gun is not empty. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, I might be tempted in that case to</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome a strong aversion to using my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists on somebody's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I reflected that it was perhaps well that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had been on deck when the search was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. Somebody might have found me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the steward's hole--though I later heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the steward had made his own report,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reported nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I judged that I had better get out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way in case somebody might take enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in my presence to carry a tale to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain; though, I understood later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the crew knew I had taken Thomp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went to the hole. It was dark. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck a match and lighted the lantern.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a cubbyhole of a place. The bunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied almost a half of it. The lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">was smoky and dim, and flickered. I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment listening at the door. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing to attract attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I closed the door and sat down and for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, rather fascinated, watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern. It was spluttering away as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">embarrassed. I loosed my shoes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed them carefully by the chair. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">methodical. I removed my collar and tie</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reached forward to the little shelf</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the lantern. I unbuttoned my vest--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was some kind of a noise--only</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wasn't loud enough to be a noise. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles became tense and the cold, rigidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">icy contraction that always grips my body</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the first whisper of alarm, and makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">me appear so nerveless and calm, took hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"YOU can't stay here! Please.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I jerked my head back over my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. A woman's face peered up out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shadows from under the covers of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned around in my chair and looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at her. I could not see her face very</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly. I said nothing for a few moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">What is there one can say in a situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the kind? I could not gallantly offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to withdraw myself. I had no place else</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go on the ship. I had as good reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she for wishing to keep out of sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So I looked hard and long and my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared a little and became accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was in that bunk with the covers</seg><seg type="columnLine">so ingeniously arranged that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have taken more than a casual glance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell that anybody was in it. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no outline of the body visible. The covers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been drawn and bolstered evenly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only her face showed and she only just</seg><seg type="columnLine">before had drawn the cover from over it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Obviously she â¢ could not have made so</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingenious arrangement of them herself--</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if she had blundered accidentally into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who put you there?''

Incidentally, a sure way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a normal girl interested in, if not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in love with, a man--if he has any per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonality, good looks or suavity at all--is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to try to tell her that he is "dangerous,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">color his reputation with black, call him</seg><seg type="columnLine">those names that are sufficient to make him</seg><seg type="columnLine">an outcast from society.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Let those who willingly make a study of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sex explain, if they can, why this is so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All, or at least most, of my experiences with</seg><seg type="columnLine">women have been against my will. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of them has usually come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">some such inescapable contact as discover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one of them ensconced in my bed, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which--as in this case literally, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">others figuratively, so to speak--they poke</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads to order me out of my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this case I went promptly, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out some things of a really surprizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went to the galley and roused the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at me steadily, quietly, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">said nothing.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, too, understand her hesitation in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever destroying it.

That is, he talked but I scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened. He was offering "peace," he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggesting an "offensive and defensive"</seg><seg type="columnLine">alliance. If that story, which Whiblej</seg><seg type="columnLine">had declared was for the public, shoulc</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach its destination--Thrope's political</seg><seg type="columnLine">honors would go glimmering, if his political</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence would not be entirely destroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swanson and four men came to the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Their orders were to disarm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bind me. But I--I merely pointed toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thrope and said--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With rough summary hands they searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and found nothing of firearms; the}</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound him in spite of his raving protest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stowed him on the bunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I rummaged through Thrope's effects</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found a gun. I removed one of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own, took the shells from the two of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and told Swanson to take them and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">report to Whibley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men knew very well that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been sent to lie up Thrope. But as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief conspirator and a ringleader of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed mutiny which was already due,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was immune from their violence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ygK THAT is, I was immune just then.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That night Sam Tyler gave me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship news. First, Helen Curwen</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been given other quarters than those</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered by the steward, and placed under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the protection of Captain Whibley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tyler had been at the wheel early in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">28</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">evening when Helen, frightened and des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate, rushed from the companionway</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked where was the steward, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese steward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He promised to help me! To hide me!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tell them you saw me jump!" She waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">a frantic hand toward the black molten</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tyler thought she was fleeing from a dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a snake by running from a white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a yellow man. The average Chinaman</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be trusted implicitly any place but</seg><seg type="columnLine">at" a gambling-table and with a woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this old silent steward was of a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiber than most men, white or yellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the important thing that Tyler told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me was that the mates, Swanson and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second officer, were spreading the feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the ruffians that there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for allowing me to cut on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure trove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That meant a certain danger, but I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not mind admitting that I welcomed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My room had been searched and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been watched. Swanson wanted to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">the copies of the maps. Perhaps he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had too much sense to keep them on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">person, as that would probably be the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">place anybody would have the first impulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look. Perhaps he and his men would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have tried to overpower me, to search me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when so ordered by the captain, but Tyler</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spread my name and reputation--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tyler had a vivid imagination. Too, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">name and reputation was not unknown to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of them. Moreover, I had in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin given them no chance to take me off</seg><seg type="columnLine">my guard. A man has to use up about</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of his life's blood writing a record of</seg><seg type="columnLine">loyalty and true faith before I trust him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I liked Tyler, for instance; I believed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but I wouldn't have trusted him very</seg><seg type="columnLine">far--though so far as I ever learned he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as good a friend as a man could want.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I play a lone game--go just as far alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it is possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was well into the morning when I lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, again in the steward's cubbyhole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not undress, for dawn would come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour and I wanted to be up and see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was going on, though I had nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in particular in mind to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not go to sleep. There was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much movement about; not too much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturb sleep, but too much to disturb the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace of mind of one suspicious as myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feet were shuffling about, voices muttering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A quiet rap came on my door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I started to answer, but caught the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. The approach to the door had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather stealthy. I would wait. The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened. Whispers. There was more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">one person there. My name was softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">called. I did not answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was lying on my left side; my hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the handle of the gun that nestled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a skeleton holster on my stomach. â¢ I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ready--or thought I was, but a terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow fell through the darkness and nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered my right shoulder. I was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once almost smothered beneath the weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men. I can shoot as well with my left</seg><seg type="columnLine">as with my right hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This dexterity has been acquired by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand after long effort, chiefly because</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is the right hand that fellows, looking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an excuse to shoot first, watch. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could use neither. I was in a bad way and</seg><seg type="columnLine">very foolishly struggled. A few years ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">a similar surprize was made on me, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretended to be unconscious, and presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of my assailants were themselves un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious--permanently so. But in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin I struggled, foolishly. And I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked and beaten and gouged, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed as if my clothes were being literally</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn from me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is nothing, nothing that can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done to me personally that is so infuriating</seg><seg type="columnLine">as for people to paw me. I don't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody's hands to touch me at any time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And when I am manhandled, my temper</seg><seg type="columnLine">swells up like the poisonous throat of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cobra. But my gun had been taken away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I have no doubt but that the handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it is what some fellow used to strike me</seg><seg type="columnLine">on what he thought was the head, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was only my already pained shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have never been knocked unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than two or three times in my life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was one of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I came to I found the old withered</seg><seg type="columnLine">steward staring down into my face. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand he held a tumbler of brandy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Much of it had been poured on my face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some of it. trickled between my teeth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I felt almost strangled. I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how long he had worked with me, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to think his duties had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He offered me the rest of the brandy but</seg><seg type="columnLine">said nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why don't you talk?" I demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened his mouth: he was a mute.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Born to be Hanged, But--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">At some time or other his tongue had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut out. In China precautions are taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep secrets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On board the Jessie Darling Yang Li</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I became friends. Eventually, in years</seg><seg type="columnLine">that followed, we were to become brothers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was to find that for cunning and loyalty</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Chinaman was incomparable. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had taken a fancy to me then, I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. I never did know. Not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese wizardry could foretell that some</seg><seg type="columnLine">months later my gun was to clear his trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of enemies. But that does not belong to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was washed and bandaged. My body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sore, but I was not weak. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious, but as my ferocity is never emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional, I said little and displayed patience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I asked if he knew who had attacked me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did. I repeated what names I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he nodded at one only. Swanson's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was unarmed. He offered me a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife, refined of edge to a razor's sharpness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I took it, though what I know of handling</seg><seg type="columnLine">a knife is about the same as any other man</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows--nothing except to grasp the handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thrust. A knife in the hand of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expert is about the deadliest weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I ask him if he thought he could steal</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun of mine that had been given the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain the night before.

Thrope wanted to turn back to San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco. He was the owner of the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was rich. His name was known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">every man.

It is needless to repeat: I simply said</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a few words what I have been making</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear. But even I did not know, did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspect the worst about him. Had I done</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, I believe I would have killed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I know that I would have killed him--</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed him a gun and invited him to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shoot first. 1 might have let him fire the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first shot.

Oh well, he never cared for publicity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">any way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And how was the name of Helen Curwen</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared? With unsuspected brilliancy. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">read it two times and remained incredulous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was Mrs. Captain Whibley, making her</seg><seg type="columnLine">honeymoon voyage with the captain. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far as anybody ever found out to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrary--excepting, of course--Mrs. Cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wen--that was true. Helen and Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whibley were in love and they did marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a way that interfered not at all with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather premature announcement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Thrope, as a friend of the bride and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain, had intended to take a little sea-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">3</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">voyage to Honolulu and back before enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon the last lap of his campaign. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had needed the rest. That was precisely</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had intended, for he felt certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the letter would be a bombshell in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp of Bryan, and he, Thrope, could afford</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leisure of a sea trip even as a crucial</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of the campaign.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About the only two people I met who did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not appear satisfied were Mrs. Curwen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Delaney almost wept. Then he swore</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud and fervently. He cursed me for hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ever suspected that' he would give a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend a double-cross. I took his statement</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sufficient salt to make it palatable and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said nothing to ease his resentment against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thrope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Much of that resentment was genuine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had hurt Delaney's pride--however much</seg><seg type="columnLine">or little it had hurt his honor--to think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody, even Thrope and the police, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrange a frame-up against his friend in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own saloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was angry. He asked if I thought I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could ever have "got away" with the bluff</seg><seg type="columnLine">I worked to get from the saloon if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not willingly aided? I remarked that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably could not have got away as easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I had done if he had not been so agree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, but that I would have shot--and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at that, I believe Delaney was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">sincere than 1 really wanted to give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">credit for. I am suspicious of everybody.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Particularly of my friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went to see Mrs. Curwen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was very distressed and*showed it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Age seemed to have come suddenly-to claim</seg><seg type="columnLine">his full debt and interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am desperate--desperate," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again and again she repeated that, remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that there was no one to whom she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could go. "My boy wants to tell the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am his mother," she said, after I had let</seg><seg type="columnLine">her know the vicissitudes of the ill-fated</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter, "but it can't be." She said s,t with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an intonation of finality. There was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing more than a woman's sacrificial stub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bornness in her voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He doesn't know--even yet--'all.

Mr. Ellis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been sent to San Francisco as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Bryan had learned of the letter being</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost, and who, guided by gossip along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barbary Coast, had searched me out, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered from Mrs. Curwen that it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already been returned; and he had returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me and generously paid the money he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been given to offer as a reward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Curwen, afraid of Thrope, had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the house and moved into an apartment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was why I could not locate her. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last, determined to ease her mind for once</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all, she had decided to burn the letter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then she had found that it was gone and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank piece of paper had been substituted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As she had read and reread it frequently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she knew the substitution had been but re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cently made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She never suspected Helen, but was thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughly frightened.

I as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's time then," said Blake staring up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the letter--first. Now," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN I learned something of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was all about. Mrs. Curwen was</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to get Thrope to give up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter. He would not meet her, but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a telephone appointment. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured him that she could give reasons why</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should return the letter to her, why he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be glad to return it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thrope was naturally incredulous. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed that he and Mrs. Curwen had known</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other for many many years; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thrope--though he did not say this--ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to have taken a sort of pleasure all</seg><seg type="columnLine">those years in keeping her afraid of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew that she was afraid of him, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had enjoyed the bullying pleasure of keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her frightened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By chance I had stepped into the game</seg><seg type="columnLine">and demanded cards at the crucial moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let me pause a minute to remark that no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body will be likely to convince me that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am religious; and yet anybody will have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard lime convincing me that there is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">something--something sentient in Destiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rules with an inexorable hand this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing we carelessly call "chance" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"luck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In my own life--and I believe other men</seg><seg type="columnLine">can look into their own lives and find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same--it has happened too often that by so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called chance I have made such entrances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by chance played such part in the lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men and women, as if my r61e were di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected by a great and watchful dramatist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This thing we call ''luck" and "chance"</seg><seg type="columnLine">is too pertinent, too advertent, too much the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fabric of design, to be merely accidental.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know many lips will trace skeptical smiles</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon themselves at such a statement; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">let the more thoughtful reflect that every</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation begins and develops from some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--some meeting, word, introduction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from something, that can properly be called</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is so true that it can not be denied</seg><seg type="columnLine">once any one recognizes the viewpoint from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I make the statement. And I never,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before or since, felt myself so much the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pawn of some inscrutable chance as in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair of Thrope and Mrs. Curwen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bom to be Hanged, But--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">37</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> i'he whole tiling moved to its inexorable</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, its inexorable and tragic end, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitably to have been mere happen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. But, of course, I am telling a story</seg><seg type="columnLine">--not offering a contribution to meta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">physics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Curwen telephoned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Naturally, with all the honesty of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature, she denied that I had had anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do with the plan to get in touch with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thrope; she denied that I had found from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her where he could be located at that hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I fancy that she was surprized at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden change in Thrope's manner over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telephone; for when he had said some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty words in his characteristic manner--</seg><seg type="columnLine">or at least the manner that he seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">employ toward women whom he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">care to flatter--he abruptly became polite</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost gracious. The suggestion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he do so, of course, came from me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in such a way that he did not care</seg><seg type="columnLine">to refuse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could make nothing of the conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion over the phone because I heard very</seg><seg type="columnLine">little of it after Thrope quieted down. Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Curwen seemed to be doing all of the talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; and it seemed to me that Thrope was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely impressed and by something</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than I had said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I noticed him biting his knuckles as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if to restrain his emotion. But, I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected, that might have been from sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed anger. But his whole manner dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed a nervousness that was remarkable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He glanced almost furtively from me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blake as though fearful that we, too, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conversation lasted for some min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes. It ended with Thrope agreeing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make an appointment to meet her alone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own office the following night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found out afterward--from her--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had summoned one of the specters that</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunted her past and set it on to Thrope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Curwen in her younger days had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been reckless, rash, even more so than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen. She too had loved Thrope. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">murdered a man before her eyes. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no part in the crime but the love she</seg><seg type="columnLine">then bore him, which constrained her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrecy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Always she had been afraid that the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come out, and that Thrope would--</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he threatened--make it appear that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had killed the man herself. At last, des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate, she had reversed the situation and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">declared that whatever the shame might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her, she was going to force the story out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blast him, though it blasted her too!</seg><seg type="columnLine">As a coward always is when the victim</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns, Thrope was frightened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But by the following night Thrope had</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned his ingenuity. He had made de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ductions and arrived at what seemed satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">factory conclusions for bullying the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">further: let her force the story out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">public. He ended by hoping she would do</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, for he--he could make political capital</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. Besides, what is money for if not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove alibis, even in a murder of twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am getting a little ahead of my narra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive. The letter was yet to be disposed of.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That, however, did not take long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the telephone conversation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over I merely repeated that I wanted it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at once; and Blake unlocked the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">office safe and gave it to me. Then I struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">a match and burned it and ground the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashes into the carpet with my heel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I faced them and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something unpleasant will happen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody if the attempt is made to arrest</seg><seg type="columnLine">me on the charge of robbing a girl, or fleec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a miner, or violating the ordinance</seg><seg type="columnLine">about obstructing the traffic, or on any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trumped-up charges which you fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows usually make to get a man into jail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Think up something original, very original,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you want me to pay attention to it--then</seg><seg type="columnLine">send a detective you don't care much about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to serve it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was young, and of course talked a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than I would under similar circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances now. About the last thing that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man learns is that no words, or at</seg><seg type="columnLine">most two or three, will usually be more im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressive than a speech--such as play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrights like to give heroes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what I did say was brief enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry weight with Thrope and Blake--</seg><seg type="columnLine">largely because they knew that Spike De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laney had, so to speak, put his sheltering</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing over me and would, as the phrase goes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"start something" if another frame-up was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled on me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS ends my story. I will get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the concluding facts briefly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The following morning, through De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laney, Mrs. Curwen anxiously sent word for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to meet her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">38</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was to be a busy day for Thrope and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not know how much, if at all, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight he could get to the office and keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">his appointment with her. Mrs. Curwen</seg><seg type="columnLine">was exceedingly nervous, but she said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was not afraid. However, she wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to conceal myself in the office as a wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of what passed between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am afraid," she said tremulously, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall have to tell him something that no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">on eartli knows but myself--and--and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want you to know. I trust you--after what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you did about that letter, and for Helen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And after what Mr. Ellis says."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellis, Edwin Ellis, I found--he was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had come to me offering ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand for the recovery of the letter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had later forced payment of that sum upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me--was a detective from Washington who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been hurried to San Francisco as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Mrs. Curwen had reported the loss of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter. The first time we met he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned that 1 had it, but not that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned it. As soon as he discovered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had returned the letter he generously</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave me the reward that Bryan had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to pay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The elevator ran until ten o'clock on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saturday nights in the Thrope Building.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Curwen went up at ten, and I followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute later. She suggested that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be best for us not to be seen together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She opened the door direct from the hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Thrope's private office and left it un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked for me--or rather held it ajar for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and held her finger warningly to her lip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Somebody's in there--I heard them</seg><seg type="columnLine">move!" she whispered soundlessly, indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cating a door that opened from the private</seg><seg type="columnLine">office into another room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nobody could very well have proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">business in there, since no light was burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--or at least none showed under the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tiptoed across and listened, but I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps Mrs. Curwen had been mistaken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the chances always were that Thrope</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be trusted; and he might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody there--and that somebody's</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence might be for any purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at Mrs. Curwen. She wore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long coat and a bonnet hat. The thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">veil that had covered her face was lifted so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see how brightly her eyes were burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, eyes that seemed much sunken since</seg><seg type="columnLine">we last met; and how tightly thin her Ups</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pressed. She looked more like a figure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of stately allegory than a woman come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">plead with a man, for she stood erect and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long lines of the coat that fell below her</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees gave her form a certain dignity such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as one seldom sees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She would not flinch. I could teU that</seg><seg type="columnLine">much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I spoke to her with lip movement rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than with sound--noiselessly. I told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pretend to telephone that she would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait, and was leaving; then to step into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall and shut the door after her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stood beside the door opening into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next room and waited. For some seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">aU was quiet, then I detected the shuffling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of feet. Silence again. The party on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side was listening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lock turned in the door. It moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously, then sbwly opened so that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little furtive middle-aged man blinked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light. He was near-sighted and wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy glasses; and, too, he had come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dark room into a lighted one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mine is not a gentle hand. My fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened on the back of his neck. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand went over his mouth and silenced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry that he started to make. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak little office-bred clerk, frightened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even cunning. Bv occupation he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">court reporter, very good at shorthand he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some woman was coming to blackmail</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Thrope and he had been posted there</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take a stenographic record, he said; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once admitted that he had lied. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried another evasion or two. then admitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was Thrope's stenographer. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been with Thrope for years. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a woman was coming to meet Thrope</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had been posted to take it down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little listening-hole had been made in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall. I might almost say that it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been built in. He showed it to me and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted that it had been used on many oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casions. A small electric light, partly boxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, illuminated a small shelf upon which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could rest his pad and make his notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took a towel, fashioned a gag, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked Mr. Stenographer in the lavatory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I took his keys from him and investigated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the various doors. I thought it might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">well for me to have some way out in case I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to leave without interrupting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interview between Thrope and Mrs. Cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wen. Thrope's offices--he was at the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bom to be Hanged, But--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of a big lumber company--occupied very</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly half of the space on one side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building; and I found that I could open a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door far down the corridor and near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs--almost a third of a block away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Thrope's private office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Curwen and I said a few words, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was in no mood to talk; so, not knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">what minute Thrope might come, I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside to the peep-hole and waited. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch her, and did. She sat very quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless, except that her breathing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep and hurried as if she were making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">severe effort to control herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THROPE came, big, hearty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Mary," he said with kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sardonic amusement, "we meet again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you're going to try to rake up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past, eh?

But then, you see, I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">really know you killed him and I loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Curwen was amazed. She did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize that Thrope was talking for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit of the stenographic report--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not being taken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And so this Bryan is your brat, eh?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And you want him elected.

No. What do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She told him, speaking in a low, strained</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, that she wanted him to withdraw</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the campaign, that she wanted him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give up the fight against Bryan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will regret it--oh, how you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">regret it, if you don't!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was more of a prophecy than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat.

And quickly, pleadingly she</seg><seg type="columnLine">sketched the history of how she had helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and guarded the boy, and never told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">who his father was, and made him feel that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was better that he should not let the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">know who his mother was, because she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted him to rise--to go up and on, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">be honest, to be noble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And he couldn't do it," she hissed, "if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew such blood as yours was in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">veins."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thrope believed her.

Finally one of the younger generation</seg><seg type="columnLine">openly called him a ---- fool.

While it was pitifully</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent he had been a failure all along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he still harbored eternal hope that he could,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the end, go back home and show</seg><seg type="columnLine">them that he had "madegood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">[250EVIDENTLY Obadiah decided the</seg><seg type="columnLine">job was satisfactorily done, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">SSfflgRput away his tools and proceeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reap his reward.

He watched them until they be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came but an indistinguishable huddle, bob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing about in the slanting evening sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, vanishing momentarily in the choppy</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulches only to reappear, a wavering dot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the white road against the ridges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They didn't want me," murmured Oba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diah without malice. "They didn't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to go along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning, he picked up the little bundle</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had prepared and started out alone, liis</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze riveted on the Jackcar Mountains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which showed low-lying and purple across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intervening miles of gashed and broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The combined gaze of Moore, Carver and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spade was also turned upon that purpling</seg><seg type="columnLine">heap that rimmed the far horizon. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where on the slope of that rugged range</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay a tiny, rain-gutted canon with a blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall--and a million-dollar prize. Eagerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three strained their vision toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant peaks and prodded the jack pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posefully. Thirty miles would the beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry their packs; the remaining distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of almost impassable country each man</seg><seg type="columnLine">would carry his own pack and canteen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next morning the great sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">poked his hot orb over the desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">rim and smote them hotly with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first rays. Still they plodded the trail to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sandy Spring. It was an hour later when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they reached their goal. Thirty miles they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come. Almost without conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">they unpacked the burro, released him and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shade of the mesquite and luxuriant</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-weed, they wearily cooked and ate</seg><seg type="columnLine">their first meal of the trip and lay down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. Their packs, to be light as possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted of no blankets, so the three deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minedly scooped hollows in the sand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun hung low in the west that even-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing before they resumed their journey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had rested, eaten, arranged their</seg><seg type="columnLine">packs and filled their canteens. Eagerly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each with his burden, they resumed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult progress. Each hill-top they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached, every canon-crest they topped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave them a glimpse of their goal--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackear Peaks, a purple and white phan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tasm far to the southwest. It speeded their</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps like the sound of running water to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirsty man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their muscles, unused to heavy work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">protested against the pace and each broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">into an unhealthy perspiration. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat streaming from them, the setting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun was as welcome as a cooling rain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They paused on a barren hog-back to catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faint breath of air that stirred the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heat about them. The country that lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them and the Jackears spread a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gashed and canoned maze of gravel hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">and precipitous cliffs. The entire hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of square miles of watershed sloped to the"</seg><seg type="columnLine">southeast, and countless canons and washes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had carved their gulches in the same direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, pouring their periodical rushes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water into the boulder-strewn channel that</seg><seg type="columnLine">drained the watershed into the Gila.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To reach the Jackears without going</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely around the vast watershed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would necessarily lie obliged to cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever)' one of the myriad gulches. Thus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each time they topped a ridge, it was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to scramble down the opposite slope, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the canon floor and up the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Up and over, across, up and over--</seg><seg type="columnLine">constantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was like going across a great city with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out using the streets. They would climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the front of the first row of dwellings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">zigzag across the roof-tops, avoiding sky-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights, air-shafts and chimneys; thence</seg><seg type="columnLine">slither down the window-ledges and water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipes at the rear; cross the alleyway only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be confronted by the necessity of climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up the rear of the next row and across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof-tops and down the fronts into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. Once across the street, it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and over again and again. Well, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the sort of a situation Moore and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions were in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Added to their difficulties were the tan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled growths of mesquite, greasewood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cactus, the loose boulders and hot sands</seg><seg type="columnLine">underfoot, coupled with the lack of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the great abundance of heat. So, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a sigh of regret, the three resumed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">march, stumbling down the slope, kicking</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose gravel into their shoe-tops and bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tling with the thorny brush that tore them</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercilessly in the growing dusk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout the interminable night they</seg><seg type="columnLine">toiled. They had decided to travel at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, thinking the cooler air without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's burning heat would enable them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make better time. They figured they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make the remaining ninety miles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least three nights' travel. "Walk nights</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rest days," they had agreed. So in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness they fought their way; cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the canons and laboring over the ridges;</seg><seg type="columnLine">laying their course as best they could by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stars. Though there was a moon, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">waning and the far-distant Jackear Peaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not visible as a guide, and the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon afforded was negligible. Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the sun rimmed the eastern horizon</seg><seg type="columnLine">with red, Spade Gowdy felt the need of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't anybody bring some whisky</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">along?" he growled petulantly. "By-,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this is the first time I ever went anywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">without whisky. I'd give ten bucks for jus'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one shot, right now.

"You're lucky to have that. Bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter go easy on it, too. It may not last."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Water!" scoffed Spade. "Dishwater!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tastes like a chip.

He had been leading</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them almost due west instead of southwest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had been crossing the canons at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost imperceptible slant to the west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moore cursed vividly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, this ends night travel.

Moore</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook Gowdy, who had wilted against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder. "You're a hot specimen to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospectin'." He kicked Spade to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hours hard travel down a canon</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought them upon a tiny seep at the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sheer canon wall, where a cupful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water could be extracted at half-hour inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Exhausted, they prepared to sleep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day out, taking turns watching the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">that their canteens might be replenished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Continually Spade bewailed the lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquor. His body, so long steeped in drink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">craved it to an excruciating degree. Nei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther food nor water could satisfy; it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky that Spade Gowdy craved; his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the palms of his hands already had</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun to swell; his thick speech and strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes told of the torture he was suffering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His companions, distressed, but in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesser degree, did not seek to ease hisTnisery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Better for them, they reasoned, Spade</seg><seg type="columnLine">should drop out. Spade was a burden;</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him out of the way they could make</seg><seg type="columnLine">better time, and the riches at the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be divided fifty-fifty. A two-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">split meant a half million dollars, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half million dollars will buy--yes, quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At evening the discussion arose as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether they should travel this night or</seg><seg type="columnLine">await the dawn. Their rapacious minds</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoned for haste, but their sore muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">parleyed for rest. In the end they decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three Wise Men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to abide by Moore's advice and resume the</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey at dawn rather than chance going</seg><seg type="columnLine">astray in the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS Jim Moore who insisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the delay and it was Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moore who, an hour later, assuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself the others were asleep, took his can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen and slipped away in the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Jackear range. He was not afraid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">losing his way; Jim Moore could lay a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight course in any country by night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deliberately he had planned to abandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companions and gain the prize alone--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a million dollars and a oneway split.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The discomfort of lying on a gravel bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with muscles stiff and aching from unac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">customed use, together with several hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sleep during the day, left Carver a trifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">wakeful. He had been lying in the sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooing slumber when he heard Moore's</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight stepping. When he was satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moore had not merely gone to the seep for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a drink, Carver raised his head and peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the huge figure that showed darkly</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the stony face of the canon wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without emotion Carver impassionately</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew his gun from its holster and fired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The range was not long, yet Carver missed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moore wheeled to return the fire, but Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver beat him to it--two shots in quick suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Cut it out!" yelled Moore. "You got</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in the leg!

"I was just huntin' a place for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to get out of this canon in the morning."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yis, wid yer outfit all on yer back."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spade had awakened at the shots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's the shootin'.

Third of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">million'll do me, anyhow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long before sunrise they had taken up</seg><seg type="columnLine">their painful journey. They calculated</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were sixty miles from their prize.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sixty miles may not be a great distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a well-defined road or trail, but it can</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthen out into a horror when cut and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gashed by canons and barricaded by thick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ets of thorny brush and great gravel ridges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Those sixty miles up and over, down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, detouring rocky gorges and clam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bering over craggy precipices, doubly ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered by Moore's injured leg and Spade's</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing delirium, were full of toil and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day passed in laborious misery. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled possibly fifteen miles in ten agon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">izing hours. The night was spent in fitful</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep and on the morrow they took up their</seg><seg type="columnLine">task. Moore's injury grew steadily more</seg><seg type="columnLine">painful. Of the three, only one, Carver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in anything like fair shape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spade Gowdy had long since ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, and traveled erratically, battling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible monsters and reptiles. His crav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for whisky was only equaled by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">craving for rest. He ate almost nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what he did eat he could not assimilate;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his figure became emaciated and his mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles responded slowly. Only occasionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his mind rational. At such times he</seg><seg type="columnLine">begged piteously for liquor and cursed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehemently for their negligence in coming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">away without whisky. Yet he hung in</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, staggering awfully to keep up, grimly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to the almost forgotten' hope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharing in the prize that lay in the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon of the Jackear Mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim Moore hobbled at the rear, partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of his injury but principally to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent Carver from going on alone. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">existed armed peace between Moore and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carver, with the latter constantly alert to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seize any opportunity to slip off and leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slower pair. Moore was equally vigi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lant to prevent him. Each, therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept but little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were hours when they all suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">agonies of thirst.

Her bow crashed upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelving beach. The Bolsheviki cursed. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">mast went by the board. It splintered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck.

The freighter lay with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven-degree list to starboard.

There came a roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the revolver of the deputy, who didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite understand, and Jim Braden crumpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor across the poor remains of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiddle and lay there very still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     FIDDLIN' JIM sat up and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">$jp||| about him.

On the log walls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room hung pictures in homemade black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walnut frames that seemed somehow fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar. At his right was a homemade table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on it were a broken vase filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain flowers and a very beautiful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">orange-colored violin. On the floor beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table sat a boy; he had a barlow knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand and he was busily making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">water flutter-wheel of old cornstalks. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was little Jim Braden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A door opened and a woman, half buxom</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pretty, but somewhat worn and anxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking, entered the room. It all seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer. The woman saw that he was sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and she hurried to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jim," she said eagerly, "how do ye feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He recognized her when she spoke.

Yes, it was Dana, Lot Hup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple's wife; he was a little dazed yet but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's the sheriff?" he muttered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And what 'come o' the irons that was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wrists?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bill Freer's gone back to the lowland,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered Dana and she smiled upon him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The's nothin' ag'in ye now, Jim.

When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done, Shirzad Mir rose up and touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand to earth, then pressed the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it to his brow. This is something he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">seldom done, being a chieftain by birth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a proud man. Sir Weyand rose also</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made salutation after the manner of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I watched from the comer of my eye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my curiosity was still great concerning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ferang: also, for all he had borne him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self like a brave man that night, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a merchant and I knew not how far</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could trust him. While I lay on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth and scanned the groups of horsemen</seg><seg type="columnLine">that scurried the plain below us, seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our tracks, the thought came to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that our fortunes were desperate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were alone.

The family of my lord was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of Jani Beg--upon whom may the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curse of God fall. To the north of Badak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shan we would find none but Usbeks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies. To the east was the nest of bleak</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains called by some the Hindu-Kush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by others the Roof of the World. To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west, the desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True, to the south, the Shyr Pass led</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fertile plain of Kabul, but up this</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass was coming Said Afzel, the son of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jani Beg, with a large caravan. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard that Said Afzel was a poor warrior,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being a youth more fond of sporting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women of his harem and with poets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">than of handling a sword. Still, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">followers with him, for he was bearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gifts of the Mogul Jahangir from Agra to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jani Beg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something of this must also have been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mind of Shirzad Mir, who had been lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Badakshan for twice ten years, during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reign in India of the Mogul Akbar--</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace be on his name!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am ruler," he smiled sadly, "of naught</seg><seg type="columnLine">save two paces of forest land; my dress</seg><seg type="columnLine">of honor is a robe of death. For a court</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have but two friends."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shirzad Mir was a broad man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindly eyes and a full beard. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength in his hands to break the ribs of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and he could shoot an arrow with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful skill. He was hasty of temper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but generous and lacking suspicion. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of this last, he had lost Badakshan</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Jani Beg, the Uzbek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew only a little of writing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">music; still, he was a born leader of men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps because there was nothing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered them to do that he would not do</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. Wherefore, he had two saber cuts</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his head and a spear gash across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thinking to comfort him, I rose up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place where I was watching and squatted</seg><seg type="columnLine">down by them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are many in Badakshan," I said--</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ago he had granted me leave to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar with him--"who will come to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they know you are alive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who will tell them, Abdul Dost?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked mildly.

Presently I learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he understood, for, with many pains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had taught himself our tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We spoke of the position of Jani Beg.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Truly, it was a strong one. He himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">held Khanjut, which was the citadel at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the Shyr ravine leading into India.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paluwan Chan, leader of his Usbeks, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the great town of Balkh with a garrison.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reinforcements were coming through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passes to the north from Turkestan. Out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posts were scattered through the plains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jani Beg was a shrewd commander. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">once did I know him to err badly in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans. Of that I will tell in due time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shirzad Mir, who was brave to the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of folly, said he would go somehow to Agra</seg><seg type="columnLine">and appeal for mercy from Jahangir himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had been to Kabul and I knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intrigues of Jani Beg had made his quarrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem that of the Mogul and--such is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">witchery of evil words--Shirzad Mir seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a rebel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That may not be," I answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the Ferang lifted his yellow head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spoke in his deep voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I heard at Agra, Shirzad Mir," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighing his words, "that you were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">follower of the Mogul Akbar."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of Akbar," nodded my lord, "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of God and prince of princes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a soldier among many."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So it has been told me." Sir Weyand</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested his chin on his fists and stared up</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the blue sky of Badakshan showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the trees. "When Akbar was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty what plan did he follow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was a brave man. God put a plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his head when it was needed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the wisdom of books and many ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visors."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And with this wisdom, I have heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">he always did one thing when he was pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by great numbers of enemies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shirzad Mir looked thoughtfully at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Said Afzel's Elephant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ferang. It was a strange thing that this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">merchant, who carried a straight sword and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came over the sea in a boat, should know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the great Akbar. Verily, wisdom travels</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hidden ways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Aye," he said, "the Mogul Akbar would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> say to his men that they should attack--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> always attack."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Then," repeated Sir Weyand promptly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"we will attack. It is the best plan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I threw back my head and laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">How should the three of us, with but two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">horses, ride against the army of Jani Beg?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">How should we draw our reins against</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Khan jut? We should be slain as a lamp is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blown out in the wind. A glance from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Shirzad Mir, who frowned, silenced, me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when I was about to put this thought into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "How?" he asked, still frowning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Then I remembered that I also had asked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> this question of the Ferang and that his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> answer had freed Shirzad Mir. I drew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> closer to listen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "In my country," said Sir Weyand,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"there is a saying that he who attacks is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">twice armed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He then told how an ameer of Spain,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whose empire extended over Ferangistan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the lands across the western ocean,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had sent a fleet of a thousand ships against</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">England in Sir Weyand's youth; and how</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Queen of England had fitted out a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much smaller fleet, dispatching it to sail</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">against the invader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Had we waited for the Spaniards on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">s land, the issue might have been different,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he said. "As it was, few of the Dons</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">escaped with a whole skin. The advantages</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of those attacking are these: they can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chose the ground best suited to them; they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">can strike when they are ready; also, their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">numbers appear greater in a charge or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">onset."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The thought came to me that perhaps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Ferang, being a bold man, would not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hesitate to turn against us if the chance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">offered. After all, he had been sent by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his king to get money and trade conces-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sions from India, and the small province</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Badakshan could mean little to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">What did we know of the King of England--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">except that he had ships and very fine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">artillery?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Still, at this time Sir Weyand needed the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> friendship of Shirzad Mir.

Instead he welcomed a battle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laughed, when he swung his long sword,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he were about to go to a feast. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">written that a fight is like a cup of strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine to some. Sir Weyand was such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True," nodded Shirzad Mir, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened with care, "the great Mogul Akbar</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, when his men were wavering, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward on his elephant to a knoll where</seg><seg type="columnLine">all could see him; then he ordered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attendants to shackle the legs of the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant with an iron chain so that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not retreat. Whereupon his men rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, and the battle was won. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are only three against as many thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands.

Iskander-Khan</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched his hand to the earth and to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead three times; then Shirzad Mir</seg><seg type="columnLine">embraced him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have come for food," I said, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Wind-of-the-Hills, but seeing him not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Iskander Khan lifted his hands in despair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pointed to the empty huts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is my sorrow," he said, "that Shirzad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mir of Badakshan should come to my aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ask meat when I have none to give.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is kumiss in the cask, and this I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did so, filling a bowl with the mare's</seg><seg type="columnLine">milk, which is the distilled drink of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirghiz. Neither Shirzad Mir nor I liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">kumiss. When we saw how disappointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iskander Khan was at our refusal, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced ourselves to drink some. As it</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened, this was well, because the strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluid eased the pang in our insides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shirzad Mir glanced curiously about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacant aul. In the days when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known Iskander Khan, the Kirghiz had</seg><seg type="columnLine">many sheep and cattle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Iskander Khan told us what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. The herd and flock which</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sons had driven to the gate of Khanjut</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been taken by Jani Beg, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly angered at the trick we had played</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him. Also, the two boys and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter of Iskander Khan had been taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Uzbek horsemen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the youths Jani Beg had impaled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a spear which was then fastened to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gate of Khanjut. The other Kirghiz had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been shot in the stomach with a matchlock</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball and thrown from the walls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">citadel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl Jani Beg had had flayed alive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iskander Khan had been too feeble to ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his sons. News of what happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been brought him by a Khirghiz sheep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy who saw. Truly, a heavy sorrow had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been laid on the khan for what he had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Shirzad Mir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My lord put his hand on the arm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iskander Khan and spoke softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is written that what evil-doers store</seg><seg type="columnLine">up for themselves they shall taste. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall have revenge for the death of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons. By the beard of the prophet, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">swear it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt at the peak of his turban for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewel he had been accustomed to wear</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, intending to give it to Iskander Khan</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a token. He smiled ruefully when his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand met naught but the cloth. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">small turban of white cotton he wore was</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of his grave clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Truly, Iskander Khan," he meditated</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud, "I am a beggared monarch. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even a token to give you for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">service."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am content, Shirzad Mir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought of the riches that the poet son</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Jani Beg was carrying to Khanjut from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mogul Jahangir, while Shirzad Mir</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not so much as a spare horse, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">voiced this thought, being embittered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger and much soreness. At this the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ferang sprang to his feet so swiftly that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he had seen some Uzbeks approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, so I did likewise. He clapped me on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, rudely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha, Abdul Dost!" he cried, "that is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word I have been waiting for. So the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caravan of Said Afzel is now in the Shyr</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pass? Here is our chance. We will attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Said Afzel!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ride against two score, when we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">but three?" I laughed at the man. If he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mad, I must see to it that Shirzad Mir</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not suffer from his folly. "I was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kabul three days ago, and Said Afzel was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just setting out. Besides his slaves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal servants he has a bodyguard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some Pathans. They are well armed; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass is narrow. Also they have many</seg><seg type="columnLine">camels. You know not what you say!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Peace, Abdul Dost!" called my lord,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose eyes had taken on a strange sparkle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Said Afzel's Elephant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have not wit to see farther than your</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse's ears. Let the Ferang speak!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is better to be mad than calm at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time when caution will gain us nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellency," said Sir Weyand respectfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here is a noble chance. Said Afzel does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet know you have escaped. He will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be watchful of danger. His caravan</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be numerous but it is made up for -the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most part of women and eunuchs. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, in the narrow ravine they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">extend their line of march. We can choose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">our place of attack-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And they will dig our graves there,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shirzad Mir frowned at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And we will have the advantage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprize," continued the Ferang. "Jani</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beg will hardly think to send reinforce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments to his son because he knows that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Said Afzel is well attended. We will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to gain the narrow point of the pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">just before dark--the best time to strike."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How can three horsemen ride against</seg><seg type="columnLine">camels and an elephant in a ravine?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, for I was not to be silenced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shirzad Mir was foolhardy of his life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was plain to me he liked well the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sir Weyand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will not ride against them, Abdul</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dost. If you had thought, you would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member that we could stand on the ridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the caravan trail, where our arrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">will command Said Afzel's men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was true I had not thought of that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my concern for Shirzad Mir. It angered</seg><seg type="columnLine">me--a mansabdar of the army--to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">corrected by a foreign merchant, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent for a space. Not so the Tiger Lord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ilai--that was well said!" he cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Such a plan warms my heart. Now if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had the strong sons of Iskander</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khan--" he broke off with a glance at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mourning Kirghiz. "What men and slaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">are with the caravan?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I heard at Kabul," replied the Ferang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">settling his tall body against the tent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that Said Afzel was a courtier and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallant--fond of music, toys, verses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indian dancing girls. He is bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a throng of such with him, also several</seg><seg type="columnLine">camel loads of treasure as gift from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mogul. What do we care for eunuchs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ethiopian slaves?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Said Afzel has at least seven Pathans</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him," I reminded him. "They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">good fighters."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you an old nurse, Abdul Dost?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried my master in great anger. "Speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and I will set you to tend swine!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned to the Ferang. "Said Afzel</seg><seg type="columnLine">is truly called 'the dreamer,' Sir Weyand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He is the most elegant in dress and can</seg><seg type="columnLine">recite verses as well as his boon companion</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kasim Kirlas, the professional courtier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It is true that he travels with cumberous</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage--unlike his father--and is usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupefied with bhang and opium. I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">risk much to set hand on his jewels."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We would risk much," nodded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ferang bluntly, as was his custom; "espe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially as there is one of the big Indian ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phants in the caravan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An elephant!" Shirzad Mir clapped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stout hands and laughed. 11 Ilai--an ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant. That would be Most Alast from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stables of Jahangir. I heard it said</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Khanjut when I was prisoner. Verily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the star of our good fortune is in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascendant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought the madness that had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Sir Weyand had bitten my lord,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he laughed again and fell to talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in low tones to the other. I strained my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears but could not hear. Being angry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps a little jealous, I withdrew slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show them I did not care what they said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once Shirzad Mir called to Iskander</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you a great cauldron?" he asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Khirghiz pointed to the ashes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire, where a pot stood, large enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">boil a sheep whole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you give it me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Iskander Khan made a sign to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all he had was Shirzad Mir's for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking. Once more the two talked together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I saw them glance at me and laugh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Iskander Khan lifted up his white</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will need a good horse, Shirzad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mir," he said slowly. "The one you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a sorry pony. In a thicket yonder I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abdul Dost's horse, also an Arab stallion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that has carried me for five years. I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">fetch it for you so that you may mount as is</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitting for a king."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eyes of the Tiger Lord softened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thrice happy is the man who has a .</seg><seg type="columnLine">faithful friend," he said and with his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand helped the aged Kirghiz to rise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the two left the tent to go for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses, he spoke quickly to Sir Weyand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ferang rose and stretched his big</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">frame. I did not move, for they had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">confided in me. He disappeared into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent and presently came forth, lugging a</seg><seg type="columnLine">basket filled with something heavy. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to see what was in it, but I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not show him that I was curious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was singing to himself after his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange fashion. He moved with his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which was in the basket and put it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cauldron. I watched him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he had nearly finished there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dog that was hungry and whined. Seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dog, Sir Weyand threw him a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stuff he was handling. The dog wagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tail and carried off the stuff. I saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was very strange, so I rose up with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out seeming to be interested and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Sir Weyand, until I could see into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   B'illah!" I cried, for the stuff was rotting</seg><seg type="columnLine">swine's flesh, which it is defilement for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">follower of the prophet to touch. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been used by Iskander Khan to grease the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents. The Ferang, who knew this, laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me, Abdul Dost," he smiled, rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his lalx&gt;r when the pot was nearly full,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"is that dog better than you, or are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than that dog?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a caphar, one without faith.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those words might well have cost him his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I have faith," I answered him sternly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am better than that dog; if I have not</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith, he is better than I." I laid a hand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on my sword. "If you wish a quarrel-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Peace!" cried the voice of Shirzad Mir</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us. "It is time we mounted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was leading a fine gray stallion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iskander Khan had Wind-of-the-Hills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Likewise, the Kirghiz gave to us two good</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows and quivers full of arrows--also he</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought his own sword from the tent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">girded it on Shirzad Mir. What man could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do more than Iskander Khan did for us?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The blessing of God go with you, Shirzad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mir," he said in parting. "I shall stay at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this tent, and perhaps-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will come back," said my lord swiftly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I will not forget."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We watched the bent form of the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">go into the empty tent; then we set spurs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our mounts. The cauldron Sir Weyand</seg><seg type="columnLine">had slung on a long pole, one end of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he carried and I the other. Shirzad Mir</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode bridle to bridle with him--I following</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind. Still they talked together eagerly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like boys with a new sport. Once Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weyand looked back at me and grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you are afraid to come, Abdul Dost,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "you are free to drop the pole</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before I could think of a fitting answer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was speaking again with Shirzad Mir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verily, I was angered. The pole leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jumped, and I was forced to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">lest the vile fat should fly out on me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no doubt in my mind that lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of food had unsettled my lord's brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why else should we ride at a fast trot</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the hot ravines of the hills to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shyr Pass, where at any moment we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet a wandering patrol on the watch for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us? And why did we carry that accursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">pig's flesh?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Sir Weyand, my brain was black</seg><seg type="columnLine">with anger. I wanted to swing my scimitar</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his long sword. Had it not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the events of that evening, I should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     OUR horses were steaming when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we came out of a poplar thicket</seg><seg type="columnLine">"on a hill near the caravan track and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a boy shepherd watching us from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flock. When he recognized Shirzad Mir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lad put down his bow and dropped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hazaret salametl" he cried joyfully, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dialect of his tribe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had thought Shirzad Mir was dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My lord questioned him swiftly. The boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him that the caravan of Said Afzel</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not yet passed this point. Our good</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune still held, yet I was doubtful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was to come. Shirzad Mir bent over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Speak, little soldier," he laughed, "how</seg><seg type="columnLine">would you like to shoot an arrow in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">service of your lord?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy's eyes brightened and he fingered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bow, being both pleased and shy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attention paid him. He was a slight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark-skinned Kirghiz--the same that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">visited Iskander Khan's aid--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words delighted him. Shirzad Mir honored</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by taking him up behind on his horse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My belly yearned for the mutton that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have cooked and eaten, but my</seg><seg type="columnLine">master would not linger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was midafternoon, and the sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very hot. We were in the pass now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">once we met a runner coming up the ravine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a man of Said Afzel, and when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">Said Afzel's Elephant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">saw us he bounded up into the rocks. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shirzad Mir fired an arrow swiftly. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">lord was an excellent shot. From the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">we took the message.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It said that Said Afzel would camp that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night at a certain level spot in the pass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the caravan track was too narrow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides being on the bank of the turbulent</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream Amu Daria, to travel at night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Probably Said Afzel liked better to sit on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cushions of a silk tent than to ride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God is good to us," exclaimed Shirzad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mir and pressed forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Although I still said nothing, I had a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreboding. No man has ever called me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a coward, but our strength was sapped by</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger--we had no armor or firearms. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were acting on the mad whim of the Ferang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for the first time in his life my master</seg><seg type="columnLine">had put aside my advice for another's--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the merchant who made me carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pot of swine-flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We passed the open place where Said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Afzel had planned to camp. We knew now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the caravan could not be far away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Shirzad Mir sent the boy ahead to spy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He ran swiftly, like a young mountain goat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We came to the very place where I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">first met the Ferang, and I bent my ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">back like a horse, listening for hoofs on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail behind us, for here we were in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap. On one side the cliff rose sheer for</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps four spear lengths. On the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand the slope, steep and strewn with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks and thorns, dropped abruptly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing stream which was deep enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drown a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Truly, I thought, the madness of Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weyand had brought us to an evil place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If a patrol of Uzbek horsemen should come</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us we would be caught between them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the caravan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even a brave man feels a prickling of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh when he knows not what is before and</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him. The mad fantasy of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">two had veiled their minds from danger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shirzad Mir, to make matters worse, set</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir Weyand and me to rolling some stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the path from the slope. While we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were doing this he dismounted and led our</seg><seg type="columnLine">three horses by a roundabout path up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not until we had the stone heap nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the height of a man and were panting from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the toil--my bruises had not yet healed--</seg><seg type="columnLine">did he call for us to cease. Then Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weyand made me take the pole with him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and carry it up the slope to the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff. If the foul fat had fallen back on me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should have struck him, but it was my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate that it did not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back into a cedar grove we carried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">accursed thing. Here Shirzad Mir had</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindled a fire from dried cedar branches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The trees may hide the smoke," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Quick--our time is little!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if possessed of a demon, Sir Weyand</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked at the fire, placing the cauldron</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the logs so that the fat began to heat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meanwhile, Shirzad Mir stood at the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cliff to watch for the coming of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun had dropped behind the peaks at</seg><seg type="columnLine">our backs. There was no wind. The scent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cedars was sweet in my nostrils, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir Weyand made me labor over the evil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelling pot. I had none of his wild hope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For, without doubt, Said Afzel, whom we</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought, would ride the elephant, and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once tried to attack one of the beasts in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ravine in which the stream muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clothed in shadows and it must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the time of sunset prayers when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy came running back up the path, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shirzad Mir called to him, and the youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">came nimbly up the cliff, clinging somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sheer rock, until my lord reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a hand. Then he bowed his head to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shirzad Mir's feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The caravan comes, Lord of Badakshan!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cried eloquently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How many and in what order?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shirzad Mir swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some horsemen, riding slowly, are in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front. Then a group of slaves with burdens</seg><seg type="columnLine">on foot. Following them some armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">riders. Then a black elephant with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering howdah."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God is with us!" cried Shirzad Mir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned to me merrily. "Ho--Abdul</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dost of the dark brow! What think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an elephant in the ravine of Shyr?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had seen none of the beasts in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Badakshan before, but something of Shirzad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mir's purpose flashed on me, and I felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart-leap of the hunter when he sees game</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach his hiding-place. Sir Weyand</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred the fat, which was now boiling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubbling odorously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above the place where we had piled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones so they would look as if they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen down the slope, my lord sent the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with his arrows. He, himself, took his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow and crawled forward to where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see him down the pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a sign from Sir Weyand, I helped him</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift the cauldron from the fire by its stick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We carried it to the edge of the ravine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go with your master," said Sir Weyand</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me under his breath, "and take your</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow. I will manage the rest of my task</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nothing loath, I obeyed. Crouching</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside Shirzad Mir, I could see the caravan</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming up the pass, in the quiet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening. The bearers and camelmen were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing ahead with loud cries, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camping-place.was just around a turn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS a brave sight. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pathans, as the boy had said, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lead--lean men, riding easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fully armed. Next came the Ethi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opians, with their heavy burdens. They,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, were unarmed. I counted seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pathans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then appeared Most Alast, the elephant</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Mogul. He had two red stripes</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his forehead, and silver bells at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck. I could see the white heron's plume</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Said Afzel in the howdah behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mahout. Slowly, slowly, they came for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It could not be better, Abdul Dost,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried my master joyfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took heart from this. For, though his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were shining, he was laughing to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, which was a good sign. He was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad. I. had begun to see his plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Last came the long-haired camels, bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women, the baskets which probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained the treasure, and the eunuch</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards of the harem. A few slaves in</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorgeous tunics walked with the dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">camelmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A lone Pathan brought up the rear. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt Shirzad Mir's hand on my arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shoot your arrows among the camel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, Abdul Dost," he said. "I will take</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of the leading riders--I and the boy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I shout, raise our battle-cry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout as if you were many men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded to show that I understood. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">strung my bow and waited, lying on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">belly. It was just as if Shirzad Mir and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I were stalking antelope. Yet never had</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stalked such game as this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun had left the pass, but there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still light when the Pathans passed under</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">us and arrived at the heap of stones. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking together, three of them dismounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began to clear away the stones, drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping them down the slope into the stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">to free the path for the elephant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We four were silent on the cliff, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could hear Sir Weyand working at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. The swaying howdah of Most Alast</seg><seg type="columnLine">came nearer--so near I could see the jewels</seg><seg type="columnLine">set in the turban of Said Afzel, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing with a fat man on the cushion</seg><seg type="columnLine">by him--Kasim Kirlas, I thought. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have almost reached down and touched their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Shirzad Mir bellowed his battle-cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hai--Shirzad el kadr--hail"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaped to his feet and began to speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows down at the riders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hai--Shirzad el kadrl" I echoed, twang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a shaft among the camels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It must have reached its mark, for one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beasts yelled with pain. I heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrill shout of the boy and the startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries of the slaves below us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Sir Weyand came to my side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "St. George for England!" he cried. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked him later what it was, and he told me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he shouted, he pushed the cauldron</seg><seg type="columnLine">over on its side. The boiling fat fell on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad rump of Most Alast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An elephant has a thick hide, but he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensitive and nervous as a woman--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boiling grease was very hot. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alast lifted up his trunk and bellowed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain. Then he charged forward. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">howdah, with Said Afzel and Kasim Kirlas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped its girths as Most Alast shook him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self--the fat had missed the howdah, to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorrow--and the two went to earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Most Alast dashed among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">riders. Several horses leaped over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope in their fright. Finding himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the stones, the elephant turned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the narrow path and charged back against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camels, which gave way before him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some stumbled into the brush of the slope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Others pressed against the cliff wall. B'il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lah, there was much confusion!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The camels, being frightened and hurt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to yell also, and the horses too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The black slaves had leaped to shelter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood watching, their eyeballs showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">white. The camelmen sought safety where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shirzad Mir had reckoned well what</seg><seg type="columnLine">havoc an angered elephant would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">along that narrow path.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Said Afzel's Elephant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was a middling shot with a bow, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">my lord was a marksman among many.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His shafts sought out the Pathans, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no time to use their matchlocks before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had to leap out of the way of Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alast. Yet he killed none. Before long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew why.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eai--Shirzad el kadr--hail" cried my</seg><seg type="columnLine">lord for the last time, and ordered me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek the horses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the boy plied his arrows from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff, we two, with the Ferang, rode rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down until our horses stood at the slope</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the pile of stones. Here Shirzad Mir</seg><seg type="columnLine">called upon the Pathans to throw down their</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A Pathan is a good fighter when and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it suits him. These men were less afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us than of Most Alast, who was trumpet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing back and forth along the path, heedless</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the efforts of his mahout. They saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were armed and ready. They did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how many more of us there were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three of the Pathans were hurt by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows of Shirzad Mir. Two others had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen among the rocks and thorns of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope below. The other two were afoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watching the elephant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All who could do so put down their mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kets and swords and said that they had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough of the affair. Shirzad Mir would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not move until he had seen the two who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the thorn thicket climb out, curs-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, but little the worse for their fall, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">join the others. Then we left Sir Weyand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had picked up a brace of their dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carded pistols, to watch the group, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went forward with me at his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Find Said Afzel," he ordered me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw the Uzbek prince leaning tutbanless</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a rock, feeling of himself tenderly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is no light thing to fall from the howdah</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an elephant. Kasim Kirlas, the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessional courtier, was stretched on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground at his feet--but this was no salaam;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man was stunned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shirzad Mir caught the dazed prince by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulder and bade him sternly walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">before his horse. My lord had drawn his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword, and this he kept near the bare neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Said Afzel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is the elephant?" he asked me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I pointed to the stream below and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shirzad Mir laughed aloud. He ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciated a good jest. Most Alast had</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelled water, and had somehow got him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self down the slope to the stream unhurt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He was drawing water up in his trunk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirting it over his sore back--mahout</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all. Later Most Alast lay down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mud. It was many hours before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get him to leave it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shirzad Mir pushed through the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered bearers swiftly. Half of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camelmen had lied. One or two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eunuchs drew their scimitars when my lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">came near the camels on which were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, but when they saw the plight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Said Afzel, with my lord's sword at his ear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they threw down their weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a sorry gathering that we grouped</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the cliff wall. Eunuchs and slaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">are masters of brave words, but I have yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the ones who will face danger to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies without shrinking. I cast about</seg><seg type="columnLine">and discovered that the Pathan who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed the rear guard had fled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shirzad Mir was now master of the field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He called to the boy on the cliff--our foes</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that many more were there--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot down the first man of the caravan who</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved from his place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he ordered me to ride my horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly back and forth among the remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">camels, the women and their attendants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see that none escaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was now growing dark, so of my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">will I set four of the camelmen to building</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great fire at the lower end of the caravan</seg><seg type="columnLine">and another by the heap of stones. So it</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened that when it grew dark we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">our prisoners securely between the two fires</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could see all that passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shirzad Mir had gone straight to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pathans and talked with them a long time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently he came to me and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They will join my party, being men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">sell their swords.

There was no chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me to sleep, but I think Sir Weyand</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept a little during his watch over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pathans. Before dawn I had spoken with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mahout of Most Alast and given him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">handful of gold from the treasure bags.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He--one master being as good as another--</seg><seg type="columnLine">consented to serve us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At dawn I had finished my task.

I urged the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan, Sir Weyand the second, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pathans, who had now cast their fortunes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us, the third.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our danger was great, for when news</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what had happened in the pass reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khanjut by way of some escaped bearers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole army of Jani Beg was sent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunt us down.

At each village Shirzad Mir would</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismount from Most Alast and spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">money--from the bags of Said Afzel--for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wine he bought freely, and food, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered silver among the people. So that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all might see, he held his durbar. Said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Afzel, the opium-eating prince, he forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do homage in public to him; fat Kasim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirlas, the professional courtier, Shirzad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mir made pay him extravagant com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pliments; el ghias, the buffoon of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caravan, performed his tricks; the musi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cians of Said Afzel sang--at the sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">points of the Pathans--and the dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls danced. It was a great feast. Shirzad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mir, looking the proud king he was by</seg><seg type="columnLine">birth, sat on cushions under a cloth-of-gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent which we found in the baggage, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched idly, saying nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir Weyand cleaned his soiled garments</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sat at the right hand of Shirzad Mir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the ambassador from England. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not attend, for at every feast I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the lookout places, with certain men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hills who rallied to our standard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping watch. The men of Jani Beg</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed us close. We moved each day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">marching in the night to a new village. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept a good watch and at each new place</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of our men came in to see and hear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for rumors of what had happened spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the hills. Shirzad Mir gave to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them gold and weapons from the store we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the plain of Badakshan we could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have avoided being overtaken by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavalry of the Uzbeks. But in the hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were at a loss--and the people aided</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. It was a mad scheme, yet its very mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness protected us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh, Lordy, Lordy!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He himself put on the jewels he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Said Afzel, and--sitting placidly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Most Alast, the black elephant, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two crimson stripes of the Mogul on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose--he looked the king he was. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts of his old soldiers, who thronged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us from the hills, were uplifted at this sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Always Shirzad Mir directed me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel in a circle, through Anderab, Ghori</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Bamian, back to where we had started,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Shyr Pass. In spite of danger he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did this, and we all wondered, until one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">we came to the desolate aid of Iskander</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khan, as Shirzad Mir had planned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the old Kirghiz chieftain came</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth and lifted up his hands at the sight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shirzad Mir in his gorgeous robes dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted from Most Alast and embraced</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iskander Khan, while we all watched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then my lord pointed to the caravans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the camels, the treasure and the women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Choose," said he to Iskander Khan;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"it is all yours for the asking."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Iskander Khan would not, saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was unworthy of such honor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whereupon Shirzad Mir called for us all</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see. He loaded the horse Iskander Khan</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given him in his need--the fine Arab</seg><seg type="columnLine">stallion--with pots of gold and gems, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put the bridle in the Kirghiz' hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put a robe of ceremony on Iskander</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khan and girded on him the sword from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own waist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This man," he said loudly, "shall be</seg><seg type="columnLine">always at my left hand until he dies.

I watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy, his boots in his hand, a tiptoein' for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corral. The good doggie was nowhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sight, you better believe, and the corral</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only fifty yards away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andy was half-way to the bars when</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's a howl at the back of the house and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a black streak shot round the corner and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took after Andy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andy didn't dally.

And that dog was capering round</seg><seg type="columnLine">below a-uttering the most frightful roars I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever heard. Andy was sure stuck, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ole had built his corral as stingy as possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bars were so wide apart the dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">could sift through most anywheres he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't my place, me being a guest and all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go calling off no dog as big as a calf, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to please a friend.

Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a round of the patients and seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them all quiet, he followed the officer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night was dark and heavily overcast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wind which had been blowing from al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most dead ahead, was now abeam. Coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the lighted compartment to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkened bridge, Saltsman could not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">very well at first. Only the quartermaster</seg><seg type="columnLine">at die wheel and the dark blur of a bundled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up signal-boy pacing back and forth were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Makings of a Sailorman</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Mr. Hoskins?" asked Saltsman</seg><seg type="columnLine">in low tones, going over and looking into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the binnacle past the helmsman's shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back to the chart - room, I guess.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What're you doing, Salty? Helping him</seg><seg type="columnLine">navigate?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saltsman grinned. Being kidded about</seg><seg type="columnLine">studying navigation had never worried him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I brought him some medicine," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you'd better give it to him," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other. "He's peevish enough to heave</seg><seg type="columnLine">you over the side if he catches you chewing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fat with the man at the wheel. Beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">it now, before you're caught."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saltsman could not resist another look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the compass, despite the other's warning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saltsman noted that the course was two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and seventy degrees. He repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the figures over to himself to keep from</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgetting them as he went toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chart-room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The side door was open, and at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance he called softly. Getting no</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, he went on in. At once he caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of heavy, labored breathing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a moment he was kneeling over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer's body lying full length on the deck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saltsman took hold of his shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook him. Hoskins groaned, threshed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with his arms and sent the glass which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saltsman held spinning across the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The motion was one of delirium and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his nursing the sailor recognized it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even in the dark. He put his hand on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer's forehead and then down inside his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt. The man seemed afire with the fever</seg><seg type="columnLine">that racked him. Saltsman wondered what</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do next. In the back of his consciousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was still repeating the course he had read</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the compass, and suddenly he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was wrong. He had just left half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour's painful study of his chart and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered that the true course was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two hundred and seventy degrees,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "Ought to be one hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy, or near-abouts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook Hoskins again and tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rouse him. Then he thought of the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">order book, the purpose of which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried so faithfully to memorize. Leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hoskins, he switched on the light over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad desk where the charts were spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found the course written in ink as</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly as could be--signed with the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain's initials--"One hundred and seventy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">degrees." The chart was there also, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show plainly that the course should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost due south instead of west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By tlie light Saltsman saw, too, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hoskins' face was flushed, his mouth open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his hands gripping convulsively. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseeing eyes stared straight up at the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bad off," said Saltsman. "Must've</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell in a faint, like Tilman did. I'd better</seg><seg type="columnLine">call doc."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shoving aside the chart and navigation</seg><seg type="columnLine">books, he lifted the heavy man to the desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put an oilskin coat under his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he ran out on the bridge again to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">if by any chance he had been mistaken in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reading of the compass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's all the excitement?" asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartermaster, who had heard the breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass. "Did he throw the stuff at you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Hoskins is bad sick. I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">after doc. But you're steering the wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. It ought to be one hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy, not two hundred and seventy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Must've had a shot too many of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own dope," said the quartermaster calmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fooling with the wild ones in the sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay must be catching. Go see about Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hoskins and turn off that light you left</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning in the chart-room."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The course is wrong, I tell you," in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted Saltsman, "and it's narrow along</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. Change it right away before I go."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Change nothing, you big boob! What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you think I am, taking orders from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby whale? Changing the course without</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper orders is apt to put a man in jail</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the rest of his life, if he's unlucky enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to still have it when the ship hits the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it's there in the book," said Salts-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, growing more excited all the time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I saw it. Hurry, so I can go on and do</seg><seg type="columnLine">something for Mr. Hoskins!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I go by my orders, bo," said the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly. "Brush on by, now. If you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">so sure of yourself, wake up the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tell him your troubles, but don't tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get away from there," said the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailor with sudden determination. "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">heading wrong, certain and sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took hold of the wheel, struggling for</seg><seg type="columnLine">its possession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Micky Morton, the quartermaster, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the old-timers, squarely built and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocky.

It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been a knockout for most any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">else, but Saltsman only grunted, shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and swept back with one of his big</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, holding the wheel over with the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The move was unexpected, as the quarter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">master had good reason to believe that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow would put the man out, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark he did not see it coming. He was sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning across the bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You leave me be," said Saltsman with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out anger. "I know what I'm about."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Same as all the other nuts from the nut</seg><seg type="columnLine">farms," retorted the quartermaster, his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringing with the mighty cuff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He collided with the nest of speaking-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes that went below, and jerked out one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plugs to whistle for the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll have the Old Man up. Come on</seg><seg type="columnLine">over here, Bert," he called to the signal-boy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gimme me a hand with this loco hay</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitcher. Can't wait for an answer, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle will bring him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bert was reluctant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe Mr. Hoskins did say one hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and seventy and not two hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy," he temporized. "Let's wait for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skipper."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait nothing! This bird's gone wild.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'll pile us up on the beach while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Man is getting his boots on.

"I don't want to hurt neither one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you, but I'm a-going to hold this here</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel till she reads a hundred and seventy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two men advanced, using con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable caution. The Alta was swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">sluggishly with left wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"LIGHT HO!" exclaimed the sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nalman suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where away?" answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartermaster mechanically, wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">what other complication was developing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to confuse a situation still far from solution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Red light half a point on the starboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow!" cried the signalman, pointing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Schooner or something," said the quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termaster. "No masthead light. We're</seg><seg type="columnLine">right on top of her, and she's got all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right of way there ever was! Suffering Pete,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a smash-up! Pull that whistle cord,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert! Three blasts!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The quartermaster jumped for the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gine-room telegraph, intending to back the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saltsman was the quicker. He had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light, too, and, picking up the grating</seg><seg type="columnLine">which smaller helmsmen used to stand on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he jammed it under the wheel to hold it</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he wanted, and ran to the telegraph.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Micky felt himself picked up bodily, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand torn from the lever. As he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown down the deck, he heard Saltsman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunt of effort. The pointer still stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">at full speed ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bert, the signal-boy, had reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel, pulled out the grating, and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to revolve the spokes to stop the Alta's turn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep away, buddie," warned Saltsman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm going to do the steering till the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At his command the signal-boy let go</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly. Even with the quartermaster's</seg><seg type="columnLine">help he was doubtful of success in subduing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big sailor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saltsman took the wheel. The red light</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now broad on the starboard lx&gt;w.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That'll clear now," he muttered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun the wheel over, reversed the helm, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to steady the big ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Green to green and red to red," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered to himself, "keep your course and</seg><seg type="columnLine">go ahead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The quartermaster, scrambling back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wing of the bridge where Saltsman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heave, and a roll of the ship at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, had thrown him, came up behind again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you know anything, you big</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmer?" he shouted.

The skipper of the other craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have put her about, seeing that who-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever was at the wheel here meant to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">him down, rules or no rules.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">red light came on the beam, on the quarter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then showed up astern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ease your helm," ordered the captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Steady at eighty for the present.

Where is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Hoskins?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's in the chart-room, sir," said Salts-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, "lying on the table."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, still holding the wheel, Saltsman</seg><seg type="columnLine">told his part of the story in halting, em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrassed sentences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You thought the red light was a ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes sir," said Saltsman. "The quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termaster said it was a sailing vessel of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some kind because she didn't carry a mast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head light. And I made a big mistake, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being worried and upset with so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">things on my mind. I was thinking our</seg><seg type="columnLine">red light was next to that red light, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept Her going straight. If it had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliip we would have run together. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain, the boys was pestering me a lot, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulling at me. I just naturally forgot."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's a blessing you did," said the skipper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and I hardly believe you will ever forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">that little point again. This time, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had read the fights correctly, we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have run straight in across Barrier Shoals</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of outside in deep water. Taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge as you did saved the ship. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to see that you get a better chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to study navigation. You've got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">makings of a real sailorman in you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This from the captain meant a great deal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Saltsman knew it.

He was more lavish</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the "new milk" than were the other posts, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequently his Chippewas were usually drunk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gradually his power was waning, for the Indians had</seg><seg type="columnLine">little respect for the white man who got drunk with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.

The Sioux are upon us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Black Chabot brought this news.

When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned, it was with the news that the smoke which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had caused the alarm had been made by friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crees and Assiniboins bringing trade. The danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">was past, but the rumor had served its turn; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chippewas were quiet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day I was dispatched to the X.

Desset claimed that his books had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned by a drunken Indian, and all his accounts</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed. He seemed, too, to have very few skins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet the season had been a good one. Then from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Desset's men I learned that the manager had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been sending skins down the river secretly.

Why had they started so early? It was then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the blow fell. Black Chabot ordered me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay at the Pembina post and take charge during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Summer. I was not to go back to the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the whites where I had not been in three years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The disappointment was great, but I mastered it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started back to the post while Chabot and Des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set set off.

All of the Sioux</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now mounted, the horses the Pil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lager had captured being replaced by those</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose owners had fallen. For some minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the band milled about; then one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode aside and began haranguing in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud voice. The Pillager, who had traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lived on the Missouri, readily inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preted the speech, which consisted of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hortations for the Sioux to remember they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were brave men, that our scalps must go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to their village to wipe out their dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grace in having lost warriors. The white</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman was to be taken alive. I was glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Dearness was busy with her willow</seg><seg type="columnLine">wands, for the Pillager interpreted word for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">word, and she understood the Chippewa</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue almost as well as she did English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When the speechmaker desisted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sioux swung into a long line, a maneuver</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautifully executed. In this formation</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came towards us at a walk, tossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up their lances, waving their axes and sing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lustily. I made ready with my gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking the leader and a man on the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">end as my two victims, but Flat Mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded his arms and did not even see to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his bow was taut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Make ready!" I nervously advised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grunted in disgust. All but half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen of the horsemen began to pivot</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the left end of their line and, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I could understand what they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to, this huge segment was galloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly along, parallel to the woods and</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When night comes we shall ride very</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift or very soft," mumbled Flat Mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resuming the task of gathering arrows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In short, the Sioux were perfectly willing</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should break from cover and ride south,</seg><seg type="columnLine">92</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and left the six men to keep watch on us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But if we attempted to ride north we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass through the bulk of their band.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Dearness came up to us, and I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her how the Sioux had thrown most of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to the other side of the grove.

We can stay right here and eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">our horses. The rivulet furnishes water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there is a chance that some of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chippewas may come up the river and give</seg><seg type="columnLine">them battle. There's more to it than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting campaign. They're anxious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cage us up here until what? Whatever it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time will be short."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She spoke in English and I translated</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to the Pillager.

Not a half-breed hunter, not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man at any post in our department who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not have read it. Even Probos</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have understood. Yet the Pillager,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a master at such things, heard her as if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been an oracle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can the Medicine Hair's eyes, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she calls them back, tell how many Sioux</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are at the bottom of that smoke?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he humbly asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As many as were here before you killed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> any," she calmly replied. Then in English</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me: "It's reasonable to believe they</seg><seg type="columnLine">belong to the same party and split up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two equal bands. So long as he believes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my manito, so much the braver will he be."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The chief began talking to himself in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">guttural and almost audible voice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell to fingering his bow nervously. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion was occasioned by the sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">six warriors out in front. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond arrow range, and only by luck could</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ball score any damage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They began running back and forth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we saw they were heaping up dry grass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They paid no attention to us, being intent</seg><seg type="columnLine">solely on answering the signal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a leap the Pillager was on his horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">and riding towards them, his bow held with</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrow notched.

As the drama of the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">got into our heads we instinctively clasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.

Then one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them chanced to discover him and, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shout of fear, turned and made for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony. I saw him go down with a Sioux</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrow buried to the feathers in his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With screams of rage the others snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">up their weapons, opened fire and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted their horses.

For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment the speed of his mount was</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked, then picked up a rattling pace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the chief was sitting erect, waved some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing round his head and sounded his ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible scalp-cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By heavens!

I fiercely exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">With a little shudder the girl reminded:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They could have come through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods while we stood here.

In no way was the experience dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He may need help," she said, releasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentlemen of the North</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her hand and looking toward the Pillager.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I leaped out in front with my gun, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warriors behind the Chippewa vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the sides of their ponies and swung off</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the west.

But the climax of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arrival was weakened by a puff of smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a mound of grass. The signal fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">was burning, and the Indians were heaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet grass and green branches upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaving the two to watch the smoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hastened to the north side of the grove.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had the enemy but known it he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have massacred the girl and me easily, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we watched the Pillager's sensational ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploit. When I came to the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth I noted the Sioux had heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chippewa's scalp-yell and were very un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy. They were riding back and forth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eyes fixed on the timber, while one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their number was galloping madly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tip of the grove to learn what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. After watching them for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute and failing to detect any sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an advance on our position, I returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my companions and related what I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The name of Eshkebugecoshe fills the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sioux hearts with fear. It makes them</seg><seg type="columnLine">old women," loudly boasted the chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a big coup," I declared. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">may paint the marks of death and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet of horses on your body and on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent to show you killed a man while riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The chief toned down his vanity on</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting the girl's clear gaze and confessed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eshkebugecoshe is a mighty warrior,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the white woman's medicine helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. It made the Sioux blind till I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">creep very close."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Couldn't we get across the river? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can swim," eagerly spoke up Miss Dear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     FLAT MOUTH said it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">y| foolish to cross before dark, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he suggested that I reconnoiter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river while he watched the Indians.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not seem to think much of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion, but as it came from the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was bound to consider it, probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">believing her medicine suggested the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan. I thought very favorably of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea. The Indians' belief that we planned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use the ponies in attempting to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">would tend to blunt their watch of the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I followed the rivulet until I came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its mouth, a bit of a beach grown round</seg><seg type="columnLine">with reeds and tall grass. The river rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown and silent except for the murmuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">of air currents. Mid-stream a huge tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated with roots upraised, like arms held</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in surrender--desolation and solitude.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I watched the water I decided a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could well risk the danger. A long swim</seg><seg type="columnLine">under water, timed to take advantage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the driftwood ever passing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trick could be turned. But the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">was icy cold and the danger was not for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman to run unless absolutely necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet at night, with the aid of a log, Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dearness could be ferried across. I began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look about for some fallen timber which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would serve as a raft. It was while occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pied in this task that I received ample</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof that the Sioux had not forgotten the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. The proof was an arrow which</seg><seg type="columnLine">whizzed by my head and disappeared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reeds. I drew back among the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, cocking my gun, searched the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank. I could see nothing suspicious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet a savage could remain below the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the top of his head masked by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fringe of dead grass. Thus concealed, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could follow my every movement and loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">another arrow when I presented a fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">target.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought made me uncomfortable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I retreated deeper into the grove. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocking yell told me that my flight had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been witnessed, and, incensed, I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, determined to get a shot at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rascal was too cunning in his hiding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, returning to my companions, I reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">the incident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flat Mouth slipped out of his white</seg><seg type="columnLine">robes and without a word stole to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river to match his woodcraft against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentinel's. As he had reported that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sioux on the north side of the timber were</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet, and as no danger could take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl unaware from the south side, I sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendered to my desire and followed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Armed only with his bow and arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">he slipped through the growth with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">softness of a lynx, following my trail along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rivulet. Keeping well back, I watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He was studying my tracks rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than looking about for the enemy. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted a short distance from where I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in the open when the arrow missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, then glided to the edge of the reeds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, bending low, pulled an arrow from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">muck. As he straightened I saw his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitch and a red blotch appear on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">biceps. Leaping to one side, he fitted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrow to his bow, gave a keen, sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance overhead and discharged the arrow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almost with the twang of the bow there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the shrill death-cry from the sentinel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I saw a dark body bump down along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trunk of an oak and lodge against one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its branches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gliding back to me, the Pillager an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sometime I will climb up and get his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. The arrow in the mud showed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came from overhead and not from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this explanation he registered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill with his terrible war-cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We hastened back through the grove,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pillager swinging to the north to recon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiter, while I made direct for Miss Dear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. She had heard the two cries, one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death and one of victory, and stood facing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, her hands twisted together, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face white and drawn. On beholding me</seg><seg type="columnLine">she hastily turned toward the plain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands fell listlessly to her side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The column of smoke had replied to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">message from the south and was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying out. She informed that while I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been gone the Indians had used their robes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to coafine the smoke and then released it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in puffs. Had the Pillager witnessed it he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have read the code. However it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not difficult to guess the message; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">told those in the south to hasten if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be in at a triple kill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Until now I had had no chance to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">change more than a few words with Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dearness. She gestured for me to sit beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">her on the robes, and I took the oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to say:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You should have started back East the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute you heard your father was dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told him I would stay till some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to take his place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it's no place for a white woman,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I protested.

Then with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grim little laugh: "I'm bad luck. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were alone they would come; but not while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm with you. They believe I stole the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice from the Qu' Appelle or that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">medicine wasn't strong enough to keep it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I hadn't sent the voice back they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare anything to help me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then the Crees and Assiniboins?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They've heard the Chippewas tell that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my medicine is weak.

I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">guilty of feeling glad she was weary, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it proved that she was no superwoman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I arranged a robe at the foot of an oak</seg><seg type="columnLine">between two huge roots and asked her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie there and rest.

She was half reclining, half</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting, with her head and shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the oak, and as I gazed, her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank to one side and I feared she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">lean too far and lose her balance. I sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside her, and her head rested on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus we sat while the sun sped along on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its eternal errand.

He wavered, almost halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stabbed his suspicious glances up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the front of our shelter, then directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his horse well within easy range. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, only the explosion of the piece would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have startled the girl. I held my fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something suddenly alarmed him, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">yanked his pony about and rode frantically</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to his mates. Arrows began pursuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, three in the air at a time, and I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pillager was back from his trip of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery. The arrows did no damage, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man escaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the Pillager burst through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">undergrowth, his face distorted with fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On beholding us he grunted in deep disgust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet looked much relieved.

Others</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be arriving before night. Shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't get us clear. We must depend on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You think we can break through?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wistfully asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will sneak through," I answered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">renewing my pity for her as I more fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized how she had stood face to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with death ever since discovered by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sioux.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Pillager and I had the stimulus of</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle to hold us up to the mark. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">must await the verdict and, if it be adverse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill herself or die a thousand deaths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose it depends on whether the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sioux up the river arrive before or after</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark," she murmured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will be dark before they arrive,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I comforted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was horribly afraid. The Sioux would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make all haste on reading the smoke which</seg><seg type="columnLine">told of three victims--one a woman--</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting capture. I believed they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive before night. Did they do this we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must stand an attack in force and go down</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting. I prayed for a storm to spoil</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bow-strings and leave my gun master</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the situation, but the wind continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong from the south, and there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">hint of rain in the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had it been a case of the Pillager and</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself we would have taken to the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusting to reach the opposite bank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a hiding place in the thickly timbered</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. By separating, one of us would</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand some chance of escaping. Together</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the girl it would be a miracle if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could conceal ourselves even if we reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other bank of the river. Only a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">night would reduce the advantage of mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OCK) FLAT MOUTH came up to us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on his heel and retired into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the timber. I endeavored to engage</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in conversation but he would not talk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl said his silence meant he had lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentlemen of the North</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hope, that he believed the enemy would</seg><seg type="columnLine">receive reinforcements before night. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted he was still angry because I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not shot at the Sioux while she slept on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoulder. Then we sat side by side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to conceal from each other our</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety, as we watched the sun and kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eye on the few Indians. They too</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed more interested in the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaches of the Red than in us. Like our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves they were watching for the coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their tribesmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun was all but lost behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">western rim, and the long shadows cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Indians in front of us would soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">fade with the twilight. Now the race</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the red scoundrels and the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost run, my heart began jumping</seg><seg type="columnLine">most erratically. The girl seemed lost in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverie, so I left her to see what was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on north of the timber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Indians were dismounted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched across the plain to prevent our</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a break. There were no shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, and the light had perceptibly dimmed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew how quickly the light fled in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast areas of loneliness, once the sun gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the fight. Only a few minutes more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we would hope for the best. A warrior</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang to his feet and stared toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. I believed he had glimpsed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pillager. He said something, and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors stood up, one even standing on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came a high pitched call from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. With an extravagant display of</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy they answered the call, sprang to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponies and began riding back and forth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the other side of the timber came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelping chorus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Franklin! Mr. Franklin!" called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bell-like voice of Miss Dearness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I ran back, much alarmed, and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had come as far as the rivulet in search</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're coming!" she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I raced to the edge of the woods and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beheld them, riding far apart, waving</seg><seg type="columnLine">their weapons and shouting their war-songs</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they slowly cantered towards us. Drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping on one knee, I covered the man riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">in advance of the line whose elaborate head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress marked him as the bearer of the pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this expedition. I sent a ball through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest most neatly, and as his spirit fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">tn the land of many lodges his followers</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a confused halt. I fired again,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this time knocking a man half round in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his saddle but not dismounting him. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly the survivors scurried back. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was reloading Flat Mouth came through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bushes and motioned for me to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. I hesitated to leave the girl, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">urged:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go! They've learned their lesson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'll keep back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flat Mouth hurried diagonally across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the timber and emerged on the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge near the river. Drawing me down</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him, he pointed to the east bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grunted--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sioux!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I heard their signal," I informed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They came down the river on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. When it gets very dark they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring their horses over. They heard your</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun and they don't want to try it just now."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When they cross we can not break</seg><seg type="columnLine">through," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will all be killed if we stay in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods.

They will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not fight till their friends join them. Stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">here till it gets too dark to shoot. I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">take Medicine Hair and the horses to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the timber.

Knowing I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not begin too soon to teach them</seg><seg type="columnLine">their place, I rested the gun on Flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mouth's shoulder, aimed a bit high and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the satisfaction of seeing the brave go</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawling down the bank, his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders remaining under water. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill wrung a chorus of devilish yells from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden warriors. Flat Mouth hurled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">war-cry at them and danced in great glee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I reloaded and urged the Pillager to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to the girl and prepare her for making</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tip of the grove. Reluctantly he left</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, swinging to the north to take a final</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at the horsemen there, and I settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Objects began to fade out of my vision.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trees near by became blurred and unreal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">98</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew our supreme effort could not be long</seg><seg type="columnLine">delayed. The surface of the water became</seg><seg type="columnLine">a black waste, and I thought I heard a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">splash opposite my position. Now voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">began calhng loudly farther down the river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The newcomers had gone to find a crossing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see no reason why I should not put</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the chief and the girl; then the .soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashing was repeated, this time nearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quitting the bushes, I crawled through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mud to the edge of the bank and heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rippling sound that was not made by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lap-lap of the water on the narrow beach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly a vague shape stood before me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">within twenty feel, and I fired. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have time to utter his death cry before</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumping back into the current. Trailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">my gun, I ducked into the woods and fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed up the rivulet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Pillager and Miss Dearness were</seg><seg type="columnLine">about half-way to the end of the timber</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I overtook them.

From the plain on the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the sound of much singing. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south the Indians were racing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses impudently near the woods and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelling derisively. I gave the girl the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridles to hold while I recharged my gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had nearly reached the end of our cover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the underbrush was thinning out, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl caught my hand and whispered--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're trying to burn us out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sniffed and detected smoke, a thin reek</seg><seg type="columnLine">of burning grass.

Creeping to the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain I could make out moving shapes as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indians rode up and down the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the timber. But there were no fires</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning on this side, and a blaze lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the north would sweep away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Returning to Miss Dearness, I reassured</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then there is only one other explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion," she said.

I whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In many places," he grunted.

I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">him salute the Sioux in that tongue. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other asked something in a sharp, insistent</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. The next moment there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurr of a struggle, then the clump of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling body. A horseman was riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward me. I cocked my piece, but Flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mouth softly commanded:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurry! Hurry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he took the girl's pony by the halter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and led the way out into the plain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE MEET BLACK CAT'S PEOPLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON OUR left the warriors were entering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woods.

The smoke, the night and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting brought much confusion to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy. Away from it all we rode, the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Pillager in advance, and I scamper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing behind with my two barrels ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our escape must have been quickly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered, as we had not traveled more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">two miles before we heard shouting to-the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north and abreast of us.

I was saved from</seg><seg type="columnLine">replying to her last speech--a foolish speech,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as there was nothing to prevent our being</seg><seg type="columnLine">"such friends" out here--by a warning hiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Pillager.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaped to the ground and ordered us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do likewise.

Flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mouth warned:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be still! See that the horse doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">call out.

These were spies</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent out to learn our true position. Above</seg><seg type="columnLine">us on the right the enemy kept calling back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forth as they patrolled from east to</seg><seg type="columnLine">west. Still on foot, we resumed our flight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief picking his course without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitation. I suggested the necessity of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning movement before daylight, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">discouraged it, saying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must keep this way till light.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that we rode and walked all night</seg><seg type="columnLine">long with the Sioux hovering to the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us during much of the journey. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the east began lighting its fires, and we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted to see the plain around us, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">delighted by two discoveries; the plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">was empty of Indians, and a short distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead a thick growth marked the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Cheyenne where it made its northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">loop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl swayed in her saddle, and I rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was asleep," she drowsily murmured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaning against my arm. "Dreamed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">100</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians had captured me, that you came."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again her head dropped, and it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time before I learned of the heroics I</seg><seg type="columnLine">played in that particular dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flat Mouth led the way into the growth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">going ahead to make sure no grizzlies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting to pounce upon our horses. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">securely hobbling the animals so they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not escape, he disappeared in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the river which flowed unseen</seg><seg type="columnLine">near-by. I spread out the skin and three</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the robes and induced the girl to lie down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I placed the remaining robes over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep out the morning chill and promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to call her for breakfast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> .Searching the edge of the growth, I col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected an armful of dry sticks which I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not smoke, and by the time I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done this Flat Mouth appeared with several</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild geese. He attended to the cooking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a fire so small as to seem ridiculous</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a white man. As he broiled the fowl he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me the trees were ripped and seamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by bears' claws and that both banks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river must be teeming with the animals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had nothing but contempt for the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brown varieties, knowing them to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmless, but the grizzly was a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposition. Flat Mouth insisted, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, that these seldom attacked unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornered or wounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl woke up, and, after she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">eaten, the chief and I stuffed ourselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he insisted that we try to get some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. The sun was half-way through its</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's work when I opened my eyes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl was seated with her back to a tree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hair a marvel of neatness. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown a robe over me, and this little act,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so meaningless to those never initiated into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wilds, affected me strangely. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time in many years that any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken thought for my comfort; cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly the first wherein a woman had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">me any attention since I was a child in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">States and under my mother's care. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">first sensation was that of being "moth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered." I liked it. All men do, let them</seg><seg type="columnLine">disclaim to the contrary as they will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I half closed my eyes and for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes pretended to be asleep, that I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch her. Her blue eyes were serene;</seg><seg type="columnLine">her fine features were softened by repose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, in a position of great danger, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressed me as revealing her true self,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her genuine womanliness. At the X. Y.</seg><seg type="columnLine">post, where no physical harm could intrude,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been cold, hard and unapproach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last she caught me spying and colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">furiously, instinctively feeling of her hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is the chief?" I innocently asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She pointed, and I arose and beheld him</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping, lying on his face. When I stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him he came to his senses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang to his feet like a wildcat. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices had not disturbed him but my step</seg><seg type="columnLine">had. Subconsciously, perhaps, he had cata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logued our voices, but a stealthy step was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so easily classified. He always insisted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">person woke up more easily and more com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely--woke up all over as he expressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it--if he slept on his face. The girl insisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he finish out his nap, but he replied he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was "filled" with sleep and would need no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more till another day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl said that during our slumbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been no signs of life on the plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">except the buffalo and their lurking escort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gray wolves. She had heard sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in the woods, and once a red deer</seg><seg type="columnLine">had poked his head through the bushes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look us over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went with Flat'Mouth to the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he fashioned several drinking-dishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of bark, and while there we saw seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">grizzlies descend the opposite shore to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink. They were huge brutes and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be feared than the Sioux, should they</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a notion to attack. The Pillager ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served them unconcernedly, however, as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suring me that they would not bother us</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we did not trouble them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The river, he reminded, was seldom</seg><seg type="columnLine">visited by Assiniboin, Cree or Chippewa</seg><seg type="columnLine">because die Sioux claimed it. From fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of attacks from the northern Indians, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sioux, in turn, seldom came there except</seg><seg type="columnLine">in war strength. So all animal life had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been left to develop undisturbed by man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bears had not been hunted and did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know man as a destroyer. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all very comforting as long as I could believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, but the thought of the girl back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little glade alone, with these monsters</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandering about in batches of seven,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made me anxious to return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We took water to her and on the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">started up red deer which were nowhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">near as shy as those on the Red River.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leaving her again, we visited the horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found them contentedly grazing inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fringe of bushes and willows. Leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief with them, I rejoined the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentlemen of the North</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IOI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"MUST we wait until night before</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting home?" she eagerly asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I believe that is the chief's idea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knows the country and the Indians far</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than we do. We must take no</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish risks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you were alone would you start now?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In truth I should have, but I said nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then pretend I'm a man. Let's go at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once," she cried with a show of impatience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she stood and began gathering up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">robes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My imagination was incapable of detect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing anything masculine in her splendid</seg><seg type="columnLine">womanhood.

I asked Flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They know it," he tersely responded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To my way of thinking the horsemen</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not acting suspiciously. One of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leader, whirled a disk of rawhide from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point of his lance and the riders raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to where it fell, jabbing and spearing until</seg><seg type="columnLine">one managed to pick it up. He, in turn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried it triumphantly aloft until hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed, when he sent it sailing from him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again the mad scramble to obtain it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I doubted the Pillager's bald assertion</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I noted that the rawhide was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">being sent in our direction. Each rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the band closer. Now the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the piece of hide and his men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">strung out behind him in undulating loops</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the letter S greatly prolonged. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were distracted by the constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifting loops. Yet the leader, with each</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuver, brought them nearer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're coming!" I softly warned as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first loop suddenly swung far forward so as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to line up fully thirty warriors riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">abreast with their chief on their left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire the gun and get back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses!" ordered Flat Mouth, snatching up</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a terrific shout the whole band</seg><seg type="columnLine">came toward us. I fired both barrels into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front rank, and a miss was impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flat Mouth's bow began to twang, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows streamed into the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">assault.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get to the horses!" he cried and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised a war-cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not the Pillager's yell, but the cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Sioux, and faster and faster flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arrows. I seized the girl's wrist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">urged her to the camp. I had barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped the hobbles and gathered up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">halter ropes when Flat Mouth came</seg><seg type="columnLine">gliding to us, his face exalted with the lust</seg><seg type="columnLine">of battle against great odds. Without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word he took his horse and began leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way along a deer-path that led up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream. The girl rode behind him, and I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on foot, brought up the rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I managed to reload one barrel and, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing happened, I halted and charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other. The way was rough and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">every rod we read the signs of much game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little piles of hair at the foot of trees whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark was worn smooth showed 'that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffaloes penetrated the thickets in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable numbers. Signs of bears were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most plentiful, however. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelt-hunter's paradise if he could gather the</seg><seg type="columnLine">toll without losing his scalp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After an hour of continuous travel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pillager halted and briefly explained:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They didn't dare to enter the woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first, thinking the Sioux were there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My Sioux war-cry and the Sioux arrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">fooled them. They'll soon find out their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake. Their men are creeping in now;</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon they'll see where only two men and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman camped. Soon they will come</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What shall we do now?" asked Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dearness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cross the river and strike for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mandan villages on the Missouri," was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounding answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gasped aloud in dismay. Leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">post with only foolish Probos on duty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with old Tabashaw having free rein to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">timidate, to bully, and to consume the</seg><seg type="columnLine">company's rum! Run to the Missouri to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape while home was so near?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It must be so," growled the chief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessing my reluctance. "Only in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way can we save the white woman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the Mandan villages it is, then,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm willing to risk turning back," spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">up Miss Dearness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eshkebugecoshe is not willing," grimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">retorted the chief. "I killed some of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the gun killed some. When they see</seg><seg type="columnLine">how they were tricked only one torture will</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfy them. Wait while I look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glided down the rough and heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">timbered bank. While he was gone I</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained my eyes, seeing an enemy in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush and stump. At last he returned and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without speaking, led his pony down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope. I estimated our position to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly south of the Lac du Diable country</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I knew, from talks with the post</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians, that the river woods we were now</seg><seg type="columnLine">traversing thinned out into scattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">willows a few miles farther west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The river was once occupied by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheyennes who served as a barrier between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sioux and the Chippewas, being neutral</seg><seg type="columnLine">to both. More than half a century before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chippewas, a very jealous people by</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature, got the idea the neutrals were</seg><seg type="columnLine">favoring the Sioux in trade. While return-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from an unsuccessful expedition, a war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">party of Chippewas fell on a Cheyenne</seg><seg type="columnLine">village and killed many. The Cheyennes</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly migrated across the Missouri, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">since then the red shadow of the Sioux has</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung over the Chippewas, with no neutral</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation between to minimize the shock of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crossing was not difficult and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it easily and surmounted the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank, but lefL a trail a bull buffalo could</seg><seg type="columnLine">read. Flat Mouth held up his hand for</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence and cocked his ear. 1 heard nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the usual noise of wood life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're following our trail," he warned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If we stick to the woods they will overtake</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Our only chance is to take to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open now and ride for it. Our horses are</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh, theirs are tired. Once on the plain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can leave them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But they'll chase us?" asked the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded and, to cheer her up, added:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall find some Mandans, or some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Big Bellies (Minnetarees) hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffalo. They will help us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We broke through the timber and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the southwest at a gallop. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone not more than a fourth of a mile when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ringing cry sounded behind us. Glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, I beheld a warrior dancing and waving</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms at the edge of the timber. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not advanced more than half a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">before nearly a hundred horsemen emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flat Mouth was worried, for well he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would take more than an ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting party to stand off such a force.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the start the chances favored us, as our</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals were well rested, whereas the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy's had been ridden far and fast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no question as to our maintain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a safe lead,providing none of our animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">met with an accident. Realizing this my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes became focused on the flying feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Miss Dearness' mount. At every stride</seg><seg type="columnLine">I expected to see a hoof stick into a hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hurl her to the ground, leaving one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our mounts to carry double. I glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">back once more and beheld even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors quitting the woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flat Mouth grimly explained:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Big war-party going to fight the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mandans. We shall have them all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He insisted it was the medicine of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's hair that permitted us to drop them</seg><seg type="columnLine">before night came. I felt a great uplift</seg><seg type="columnLine">when, with the last light, I failed to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">out their figures against the northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky-line. The chief quietly assured me</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would be on our trail in the morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We camped that night in the bed of a dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">coulee. The chief managed to kill a buffalo</seg><seg type="columnLine">calf with his bow and arrow, and we ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured to build a small fire, fencing it about</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our white robes. Over this we</seg><seg type="columnLine">broiled some excellent steaks and cooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to carry with us on the morrow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At daybreak we were up, and beheld figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeping over the horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The country grew rougher with each</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, and we lost the Assiniboins only</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we dropped into the hollows. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">surmounting ridge or hillock we raised them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to view again, tenaciously sticking to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">track. Flat Mouth had eyes only for</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was ahead, seeking for some oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity of shaking the enemy off. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">always staring behind me, fascinated by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">implacable purpose that held the savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the chase. The girl rode with head</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed, seldom bothering to lift her gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ground. Her fear was an accident</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her pony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We began to encounter coulees filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, each a sign-post for the Couteau du</seg><seg type="columnLine">Missouri, the rough and hilly country we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must cross before descending to the Mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">souri River. The Pillager believed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Assiniboins would not venture beyond this</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of land. Yet they were in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentlemen of the North</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">strong force they might recklessly risk an</seg><seg type="columnLine">encounter with Mandan or Minnetaree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AHEAD were the steep red banks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Missouri. At our feet were</seg><seg type="columnLine">two cows freshly slain. Flat Mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspected them, and for the first time since</seg><seg type="columnLine">our flight from the Cheyenne his immobile</seg><seg type="columnLine">features showed animation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The brains have been taken to dress</seg><seg type="columnLine">hides. Hunters did it, not a war-party</seg><seg type="columnLine">after meat. Only Mandans hunt here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Assiniboins had been lost to sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a day. In their place we were dreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Sioux war-party, for the Sioux hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely about the Mandan villages, seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pick off a victim or two. To the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the villages was a stretch of timber,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in this cover small bands of the Sioux</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hide and wait for days, being satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they killed a lone hunter or a woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had passed through the rough country</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Couteau and had an excellent view</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river in the southeast. Flat Mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted we were too far down-stream and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said we must cross a high and precipitous</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank on our right. To me it seemed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">needless exertion, as we could round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the ridge by skirting its base until</seg><seg type="columnLine">it broke off at the river, but the chief felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the menace of the Sioux and must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way. I did not believe the horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make the ridge, for the soil was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glutinous mud from the spring rains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Pillager dismounted to demonstrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">what an Indian pony could do and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beast scrambling like a cat he led the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way up the slope. Miss Dearness made</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of it, although she was forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb it afoot. On reaching the top we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a more intimate view of the river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The valley was some two miles in width</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caged in by steep banks. The current</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sluggish and swollen, dotted with much</seg><seg type="columnLine">driftwood and many black dots which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew to be drowned buffalo. Imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately below us was a growth of big cotton-</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods, and from our position to these</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods ran a well-beaten path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time since our race began,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I presumed to take the lead, but before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could do more than press ahead to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brow of the ridge, Flat Mouth was halting</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and explaining that the way was full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dangers and that he must go first. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed my gun across my saddle, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger was not animate and consisted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of certain deep holes, or pits the Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dug for trapping fox and wolves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These pits were ten or more feet deep, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the openings masked by the dead grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We descended slowly and cautiously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirting several of these menaces, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know I should have plunged into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first one, had I had my way. At the foot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ridge the Pillager reined in and warned:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must say we have come from Fort</seg><seg type="columnLine">Assiniboin, that the Medicine Hair is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter of the big white chief there and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we work for him. The big white chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">wishes to open a post here and sends his</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter because her medicine lets her see</seg><seg type="columnLine">things we men can not see. He has told</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to stay but a few days and to ask for</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors to go back with us as far as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mouse. The Mandans must not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were driven here by the Assiniboins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would think the white woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">medicine was weak and that her father</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little chief if they knew the Assini-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boins had made us run."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why can't we start back as soon as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">get fresh horses?" I anxiously asked, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind reverting to the incompetent Probos</seg><seg type="columnLine">in charge of the post and to old Tabashaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullying him for rum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And why must we travel by the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Mouse?" demanded Miss Dearness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">referring to the long route to the confluence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Mouse and the Qu'Appelle, thence</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the Assiniboin to the Forks, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would turn south up the Red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must stay and look about, as if look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for a good place for a post," Flat Mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently explained. Then to the girl--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We must come from Fort Assiniboin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show why we are here. We must go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same way to make our talk sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight. Even if we could pick our trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">we must return by way of the Mouse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Assiniboin. It is the regular path and</seg><seg type="columnLine">safer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told Miss Dearness the chief was right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that a few days wouldn't make much</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference, that we ought to be thankful</seg><seg type="columnLine">at having escaped the Sioux and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Assiniboins--this to cheer her up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, we will go through with it," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearily replied. "I was thinking of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and your affairs more than of mine. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no trade to lose. Angus can watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the post till I get back or my successor</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrives."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With our story understood we started</seg><seg type="columnLine">io6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, taking the semblance of a road</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been much traveled but never</seg><seg type="columnLine">repaired. It was filled with mud and holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eloquently revealed the ravages of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring freshet. We followed this into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods and continued through the growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">for two miles. It was most abominable</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling. At last we were clear of it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were come to a riot of beans, squash and</seg><seg type="columnLine">corn sprouts, but so mixed with grass that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I proclaimed it to be mighty poor garden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I was disappointed, as I had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">much about the Mandans as agricultur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ists. Flat Mouth explained, however, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">these budding growths were runaways</seg><seg type="columnLine">and represented only what the wind had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen and sown broadcast. The tribe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gardens were farther on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here is the village!" warned the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She checked her mount and stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderingly and, with a little shudder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's like a village of the dead. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the Indians?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flat Mouth twisted uneasily in his saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whispered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a village of the dead--a village they</seg><seg type="columnLine">left when I was here last.

When they left this place</seg><seg type="columnLine">they used it for their dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We pressed ahead a bit and came in full</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of the gruesome exhibit. The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">quailed for a moment, then held up her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and gazed about steadily. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where were platforms some ten feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">height, and on these were laid the dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The shrouds were of dressed leather, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">in very excellent condition and fit for trade;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but for the most part the coverings had</seg><seg type="columnLine">succumbed to the weather and had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart, allowing the bones to show. Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platforms had fallen to the ground and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no attempt had been made to replace them</seg><seg type="columnLine">or their grim burdens. We quickened our</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace and soon were beyond the forbidding</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remember our talk!" warned the Pil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lager, kicking his horse into a gallop and</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OFF at one side and at a distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an Indian with a gun. Around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him were women and children</seg><seg type="columnLine">working. These were the gardeners and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were planting and hoeing under an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">armed guard. This was' impressive proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their daily danger. Even at the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">outskirts of their villages they did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare to move about without a sentinel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just as the Red River of the North always</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained the menace of the Sioux, so did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stretch of woods hold for Mandan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minnetaree a hidden danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the Pillager's gesture the girl and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted while he rode to the man with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun. I saw the fellow nervously cock</seg><seg type="columnLine">his piece, then stand keenly at attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Flat Mouth, with both hands above</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, talked to him. Suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun was lowered, and the guard was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking hands warmly with our companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He recognizes him," murmured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two conversed for several minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then came to us. Flat Mouth announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was all right, that we were to proceed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and find quarters at the village a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance ahead. The guard smiled broadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shook hands with me, but seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand in awe of Miss Dearness. Later I</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned the Pillager had filled him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tales concerning the wonderful medicine</seg><seg type="columnLine">she possessed and her powers as a magician.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the guard looked at my pony and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief's and said something we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He asks where our presents are,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">translated the Pillager.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He might well be puzzled, for beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white robes snugly wrapped in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket we had no possessions. No volun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary visitor to the villages would fail to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring a pack-animal or two loaded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gifts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before I could scare up an answer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl was haughtily saying in Chippewa:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell him the big white chief does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">send gifts by his friends. He has slaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring them. They will come later. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">will decide how much to send after he hears</seg><seg type="columnLine">how we have been treated."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flat Mouth's eyes twinkled as he listened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his bearing was stern and haughty as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he translated her words to the guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guard next informed us that an</seg><seg type="columnLine">H. B. man was living in the village across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, but was now on the headwaters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Missouri looking for trade in Spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man returned to his charge, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode on. All I could think of on first</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpsing the round domes of the Mandan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentlemen of the North</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">107</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">houses was of a colony of gigantic beavers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These huts were very large, some being</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety feet in diameter and so solidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">built that fifty men could lounge on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tops at a time. The door of each was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rawhide, stretched over willow, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly six feet square. A broad porch</seg><seg type="columnLine">led up to this. Near each porch was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform, a score of feet long, half as wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eight or nine feet high. On these</seg><seg type="columnLine">platforms they stored their corn to dry in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Fall, also their meat, but now these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being used for driftwood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flat Mouth told us the village depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely for their supply of fuel on what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river brought down each Spring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From my view of the swollen stream and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its innumerable trees I could see the toll</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be enormous. The reason why we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not seen more Indians in traveling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village was because the able-bodied</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bus}- swimming in the icy current</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bringing the drift ashore, while their</seg><seg type="columnLine">people watched and encouraged them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides the driftwood they brought drowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffalo ashore in large numbers, and these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were already giving off the stench of decay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My Chippewas would salvage the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutes when the ice went out, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat was firm and fresh, but the Mandans</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Minnetarees, the Pillager assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, preferred the tainted to the fresh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What men I saw on shore were stout and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongly built and wore their hair trailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their heels and even sweeping the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As they daubed this daily with red and</seg><seg type="columnLine">white earth the effect was grotesque. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">same cough which was troubling our In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dians seemed to be common with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we entered the village we were dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered and quickly surrounded. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted us cordially, shaking hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly much pleased at our coming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some recognized Flat Mouth and hailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as a friend. Then they commenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking where we had left our packs. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had explained to the armed guard, so now</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the Pillager explain to the tribe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we represented the greatest traders</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the North we had brought no goods with</seg><seg type="columnLine">us either for trade or for gifts. Their faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chief continued to explain how our</seg><seg type="columnLine">errand was to investigate the chances of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade. Of course he described Miss Dear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness as being a medicine-woman and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter of the big white chief at the head</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fort on the Assiniboin. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly amusing that I should pose as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">engage instead of bourgeois, that she, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposition, should masquerade as my</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The interest Miss Dearness aroused was</seg><seg type="columnLine">accumulative, and it was plain she created</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tremendous impression. One young buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing close to her pony reached up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to feel the texture of her fiery hair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As quick as loup-cervier her hand rose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the handle of her leather whip landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his wrist, causing him to spring back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in dismay. I think it was the blazing fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her blue eyes, rather than any physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt from the blow, that startled the fellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flat Mouth look occasion to warn that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hair was medicine and that the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman had saved the young man's life</seg><seg type="columnLine">by preventing his touching it. After that</seg><seg type="columnLine">incident the circle widened. In turn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians informed us that the Sioux had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been very troublesome ever since the snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">melted, and that since Le Borgne (The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blind), the great war chief of the Minne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarees on the Knife a few miles above, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone out with a hunting party, the Mandans</seg><seg type="columnLine">had kept their huts barricaded every night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On his return an alliance was to be formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Cheyennes and aggressive mea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sures taken to teach the enemy a lasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flat Mouth to further increase our</seg><seg type="columnLine">prestige and make them forget we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">without gifts, now stated that the good-will</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the white woman was worth a war-party</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that her anger was equal to a blast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Firmly believing as he did that the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed powers of magic, he did not hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tate to draw a long bow, and I was fearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she might be requested to bolster up</seg><seg type="columnLine">her reputation by some little display, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a newcomer distracted the attention. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was none less than Poscopsahe, or Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cat, the chief of the village. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented to him and he was duly im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed by the girl and assured her that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big white chief would do well to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">traders there and to the Minnetaree vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lages above, but especially to his village</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Mandans. This jealousy, when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to acquiring the white man's goods</seg><seg type="columnLine">in trade, was very keen among the villages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although they would unite readily and</seg><seg type="columnLine">solidly enough in opposing their ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">io8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the Pillager, the girl calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied that she had heard the Mandans</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a good trade in robes and buffalo</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongues and a fair trade in beaver; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would look the villages over for a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so and then report back to Fort Assini-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With these ceremonies out of the way we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were shown to a hut reserved for visitors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I took my pack of white robes inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned the horses over to a young man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of the chief's wives followed us to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut with a huge dish of boiled corn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beans, a tasteless mess, and another of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dried meat. The latter was impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">jecause of the Mandans' preference for</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainted to fresh meat, so on the whole we</seg><seg type="columnLine">â nade a sorry meal of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">- Despite our explanation that we had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods to trade, nor gifts to bestow, the men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">women and children crowded about our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut, eager for us to open our packs. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that they had seen all our possessions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">namely my bundle of robes, did not spoil</seg><seg type="columnLine">their imagination. White people always</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gifts, always wanted to trade. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed that in some mysterious manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would produce articles of the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's making which they were so eager to</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure. â¢&gt; It was with the greatest difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Flat Mouth persuaded them to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had nothing to trade, and their attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sullen when they finally withdrew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After' they left us in peace the Pillager</seg><seg type="columnLine">advised that we take up different quarters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">urging that by doing so we would create a</seg><seg type="columnLine">better impression. So we decided that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Dearness should remain in the guest</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut with the chief's wife as attendant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the Pillager and I found shelter else-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. Leaving her with the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, we went out to look the village</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. The Mandans, being a settled people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no need for dogs, so this nuisance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in evidence. The children, too, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite decently mannered, although they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have stolen the clothes off my back</seg><seg type="columnLine">had I given them a chance. The population</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this and the village across the river was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about two thousand, Flat Mouth said. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested we cross over and visit the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">village. Flat Mouth called out to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">young men, and, on my giving them a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches of tobacco, they readily agreed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">set us across.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Proceeding to the river, I had my first</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of a bull-boat, as their curious skin</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">canoes are called. They were much differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent from the skin canoes we used on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red River, being circular in shape and</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed of raw buffalo hides stretched over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a frame of willow. The craft had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of being very frail and not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit suitable for navigating the swollen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddy waters of the Missouri, yet each</seg><seg type="columnLine">was capable of carrying eight hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds or more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One man did the paddling, and his paddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a five-foot pole with a strip of board</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed across the end. With his first stroke</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat turned nearly around, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly reversed us with a stroke on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side. First one was looking up-stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the mass of floating trees and dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffalo, then down-stream. It made me</seg><seg type="columnLine">dizzy, yet our man was an expert, for we</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted less than a quarter of a mile, whereas</seg><seg type="columnLine">the average boatman would have drifted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">full mile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE news of our arrival in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mandan village had spread across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, and on landing we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">met by a crowd of natives, headed by Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man, a Cheyenne prisoner and now adopted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the tribe--a man of prominence. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook us warmly by the hand and anxiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked why we had left all our packs in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black Cat's village. The tedious explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was given by Flat Mouth and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest of the assemblage flattened out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and many turned away to resume the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of towing trees and dead buffalo ashore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the Pillager I learned from Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man that the Minnetaree village was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited over the arrival of six Cheyennes</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking a peace treaty. Messengers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been sent for Le Borgne to bring him back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the hunt. Black days were waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Sioux, once the treaty was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected. We paraded the village, finding it</seg><seg type="columnLine">a duplicate of the one across the river. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">v*ere invited into several huts to eat, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">always found the meat abominable. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outskirts of the village women with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoes made from buffalo shoulder-blades</seg><seg type="columnLine">were working in their gardens, with armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">men stationed at intervals. Their danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">was intimate, much like that which sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds some of the smaller wood-folk who</seg><seg type="columnLine">live under stumps, sporting and raising</seg><seg type="columnLine">their little families while death stalks them</seg><seg type="columnLine">day and night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Pillager mumbled to me-- i</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentlemen of the North</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">109</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must go back now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had known him long enough to realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was disturbed at something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thanking Big Man and telling him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have presents when our traders</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived, we returned to the river and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferried across.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something makes my brother sad,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I remarked in Chippewa after we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped ashore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was glad when I heard that the Blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was away on a buffalo hunt.

He has never seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a woman as Medicine Hair. He is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mighty war chief. His word is law in</seg><seg type="columnLine">both Minnetaree and Mandan villages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When we fought the Sioux and the Assini-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boins I thought only of escaping to a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we would not be killed.

What the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blind wants he takes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The danger must be pressing when an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian would be troubled over the fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a white woman.

For the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I realized there were no Indians hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about us begging for tobacco and gifts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We walked to the guest-hut and found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire village grouped about it. Black Cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seated on a robe, before the entrance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking his Missouri tobacco--villainous</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff--and wondering at the medicine of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When she sings her medicine song I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaves turn yellow and drop, and I feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first of the snow.

The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung open a crack, then wide open, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Dearness confronted me, her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching mine anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When can we start from this place?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very soon--in a few days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A few days!" she faintly exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Something tells me we must start at once."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Pillager would say it is your medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cine," I bantered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is instinct. It has never failed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">since I came to the Indian country. Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us start tonight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But that would invite danger. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must make a pretense of looking the villages</seg><seg type="columnLine">over for trade purposes," I protested. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is any vital, any immediate danger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course we will start at once and fight for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Now tell me just what has happened."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing has happened," she slowly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied, her eyes staring into mine and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">not beholding me. "But I'm afraid--I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">horribly afraid--different from anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ever felt in my life--I'm never afraid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death." With this she closed the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving me standing there gaping like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">zany.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT THE M1NNETAREE VILLAGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EARLY next morning Flat Mouth and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to Miss Dearness' hut and, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her joining us at the porch, asked her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make ready for a trip to the Minnetaree</seg><seg type="columnLine">villages a few miles above, situated on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knife River. To attempt leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country without visiting these "Big Bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lies," as the trade had named them, would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be to incur the wrath of Le Borgne and</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw discredit on our story of represent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the N. W. Company and its plan to</seg><seg type="columnLine">set up an opposition to the already estab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lished H. B. trader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl was afraid. Her bearing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm and collected enough, but there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">transient flashes in her big blue eyes, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious trick of glancing sidewise through</seg><seg type="columnLine">half closed lids, that bespoke a furtive fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, she readily agreed we must visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper villages to sustain our role. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">only insisted that we make all haste to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I was anxious to go and return before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Borgne came back, I directed Flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mouth to engage men to cross our horses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">promising them some handsome pipes when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the traders arrived with their assortment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods. The Mandans proved to be as</seg><seg type="columnLine">expert in handling the horses in the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they had been in collecting the driftwood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hitching a fine to a nag's mouth, a brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take the end between his teeth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swim ahead while others swam alongside</seg><seg type="columnLine">and behind the animal. In this way the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three were taken across quickly and drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">down-stream scarcely at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we landed from the bull-boat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted our horses, we were surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the entire village, every one being</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to gaze on the white woman with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the medicine hair. Miss Dearness would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have drawn her capote over her head but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pillager urged her not to, declaring that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the belief she was a magician would help</seg><seg type="columnLine">us much. So she rode between us with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her oriflamme of a head glinting in the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight and making me think of a maple</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned red by the first frosts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flat Mouth improvised a legend which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sung as we slowly made our way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd. It was to the effect that beams</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sunlight became imprisoned in the girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair when she was born, and that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggles to escape created the powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">medicine she possessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Big Man walked by my side and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed me a hunting party of a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">braves was due to arrive home after a three</seg><seg type="columnLine">days' trip and that, if we would postpone</seg><seg type="columnLine">our visit to the Minnetarees, we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">procure some fresh meat. I immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared lest the Minnetaree chief, Le Borgne,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be with this party, but Flat Mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained that the Minnetarees hunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the southwest of the Knife and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentlemen of the North</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mandans to the southeast, the river being</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boundary. We needed fresh meat</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly, but the hunting party would greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">delay our journey up the river, so we</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed on more determinedly than ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I assured Miss Dearness that we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the villages, ride through them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">start back for Black Cat's village before</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark. On returning and recrossing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river we could decide whether to start north</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately, unaccompanied, or wait till</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning and endeavor to obtain an escort</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Mandans. The girl was for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediate departure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had planned to take my white robes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me, thinking I might have a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to trade them for horses, they being about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only thing the Minnetarees would ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">change horses for. Flat Mouth, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted such a trade would consume all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, that the horses we had were fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, and that the hides had better be</seg><seg type="columnLine">left behind in the hut, where they would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we rode forth. Miss Dearness' peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">type of loveliness was greatly accented by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the appearance of the Mandan women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who could not be called comely even by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian standards. I never could under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand why the Crows, the most lascivious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the Indians I ever met, should be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most prepossessing in appearance, or why</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women of the Aricaras, the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">treacherous of any tribe I ever encountered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">should approach the nearest to the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">standard of good looks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Dearness was not inclined to talk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we rode rapidly, as if eager to have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a disagreeable errand. The road we</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed was very decent and led us over</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hills and then for two miles across a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain, skirting a small village which we did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not enter. The whole distance was through</seg><seg type="columnLine">an area of gardens which included much</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground given over to the cultivation of sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers. In every direction were horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazing on the early grass, and Flat Mouth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes glittered as became a true Pillager.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All these animals were brought into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">villages at night, revealing the Indians'</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant dread of their inveterate enemies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sioux and the Assiniboins. The Ran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dans kept their ponies in their huts while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Minnetarees used small corrals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These villages on the Missouri and Knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">were distinct from any I ever became ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quainted with. They suggested per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">manency and a strong devotion to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil, especially the villages of the Mandans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our road along the south bank of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Missouri to the Knife afforded almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">continuous glimpses of a bucolic life which</seg><seg type="columnLine">made me think of Canadian villages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All hunting was done in large bands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flat Mouth told me, for fear of surprize</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacks. Each hunting party, therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained the potentials of a war-party.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even when in large numbers the warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not care to wander far from their homes</seg><seg type="columnLine">lest the villages be assaulted in force during</seg><seg type="columnLine">their absence. Because of this caution it</seg><seg type="columnLine">became necessary to conserve the buffalo</seg><seg type="columnLine">and under no circumstances scare him away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It resulted that they aimed to surround a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small herd of a few hundred and kill every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. They believed that if a survivor</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped he would communicate his alarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">to other herds. Nor did they use their</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns in hunting, but always the bow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first pause in our journey was at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minnetaree village at the mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knife, consisting of half a hundred huts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and called the ''little village." We very</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly learned there was a great difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">between this and either of the Mandan</seg><seg type="columnLine">villages in regard to manners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moment we were sighted a mob of</seg><seg type="columnLine">young demons surrounded us, hooting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deriding. Their elders sat smoking their</seg><seg type="columnLine">miserable tobacco on top of the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular huts and enjoying the spectacle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More troublesome even than the children</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the dogs which swarmed from all</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions. They were as vicious as wolves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and much more daring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Dearness, who had drawn her</seg><seg type="columnLine">capote over her head when we neared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">village, gave a cry of alarm, and I spurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and brained a brute with the butt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my gun as he leaped high to pull her from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle. This act caused much scowling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mumbling from the spectators, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I interpreted to be threats. Flat Mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned low from his saddle and did for</seg><seg type="columnLine">another beast with his ax. The mumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke into a sullen roar, and the men on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huts began rising and preparing to descend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flat Mouth pulled out his string of Sioux</seg><seg type="columnLine">scalps and, waving them above his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted his name and the fact that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once lived among the Mandans and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minnetarees. Then in their own tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">he chanted his record of coups, touching</seg><seg type="columnLine">112</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a scalp as he narrated the details of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">encounter. The men on the huts gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the edge and allowed their feet to hang</seg><seg type="columnLine">down while they listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finishing the story of his exploits, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pillager explained how he was serving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman with the medicine hair, the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful woman ever on the Missouri,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose father was the mightiest of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">traders and who had intended to build a</seg><seg type="columnLine">post among the villages so the Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">could always obtain whatever they wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in arms and ammunition. He significantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">concluded with saying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The big white chief will send no traders</seg><seg type="columnLine">where his daughter is met by mad dogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and screaming children."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, turning to Miss Dearness, he di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected her to reveal her hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She obeyed, and'as the Indians stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her fiery hair, those on the ground drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forgot their scowls, while those</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the huts stood erect and forgot their</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking. As the Pillager rapidly trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated his speech to me I understood their</seg><seg type="columnLine">concern; each village was anxious to obtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the white man's goods possible and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely jealous of every visit made by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trader to a neighboring village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their lack of hospitality was an excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">excuse for us to save time by pushing on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although they beseeched us to enter their</seg><seg type="columnLine">huts and partake of food and tobacco, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">held on steadily through the village and</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the road leading up the Knife. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed us outside the village but we gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">them no heed. We followed the road for</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a mile when the Pillager halted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced that we were opposite the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minnetaree village. He said it consisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some hundred and thirty huts, but, rub</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes as I would, I could not see it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he explained this. The last of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">five villages was located a mile back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, and because of this fact and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">resulting problem over fuel the warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved into the hills each Winter, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had more circular huts and wood</seg><seg type="columnLine">aplenty. We forded the Knife with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water up to our horses' bellies and made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dash for the village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS time we met less of the rude-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness which had greeted us below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet there was no suggestion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hospitality. They were rude in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. We were ignored. They were most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">arrogant in their bearing. After ordering</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman to show us to a big hut, set apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">for visitors, they paid no attention to us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A physical characteristic of all Minnetarees</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the large aquiline nose. The Pillager</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured us we were safe among them, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">added that this was the case purely because</seg><seg type="columnLine">they must have arms from traders to protect</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves from the Sioux, and they believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were paving the way for permanent</seg><seg type="columnLine">traders. The village originally contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand huts, but the deadly small-pox</seg><seg type="columnLine">had whittled it down to its present pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hut we were shown to was a duplicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the one in Black Cat's village except</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was dug down three feet below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface. As tn the Mandan huts we found</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthen pots and a copper kettle. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">kettle, it seems, was used entirely for</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiling meat. Why they couldn't cook</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat in the earthenware, as. they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">their com and beans, I do not know. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish superstition was behind it, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. I asked the woman about it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said the meat would make the earthen</seg><seg type="columnLine">pots crack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I quickly learned it was unsafe to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the hut unless armed with a club.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The first Lime I stepped to the door to</seg><seg type="columnLine">survey the scene, I was set upon by a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog. I kicked myself clear of the brute</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after that I never ventured abroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a club in my hand. So long as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained in the hut we were left by our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. The moment we passed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door we were surrounded by impish</seg><seg type="columnLine">brats who would go through our clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and filch anything they could. Miss Dear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness went out with us once, but the repulsive</seg><seg type="columnLine">sights and the constant attendance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicious-mannered mob which accompanied</seg><seg type="columnLine">us every step was experience enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You and the Pillager carry out your</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans," she urged after we returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut. "But let us start back to the Mandan</seg><seg type="columnLine">village before dark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a beastly place," I admitted, pitying</seg><seg type="columnLine">her deeply. "I almost wish, for your sake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had tried to win back north without</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming here. I think we could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, we stood no chance. The Sioux</seg><seg type="columnLine">were too close, the Assiniboins too many.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our lives are safe here, but we ought to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting for the Red River within a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentlemen of the North</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">113</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">or two." After a pause she asked, "When</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you think Le Borgne will come?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not till after we have gone. You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My father spoke of him when we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Assiniboin. The Indians had much</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell of him. But go and finish your busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness so we can be getting away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The undercurrent of her thoughts was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Borgne, that sinister master of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minnetarees, who ruled as an autocrat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unusual condition of affairs among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians. I did not care to ask her what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard about the chief; it was sure to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">something disquieting. I picked up my</seg><seg type="columnLine">club and, followed by Flat Mouth, passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the hut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had a brisk battle with the dogs but</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally put them to rout. Young bucks</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaggered close, glaring murderously at</seg><seg type="columnLine">our success over their pets. One was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">bold as to step before the Pillager to block</seg><seg type="columnLine">his path, or to make him step aside. Flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mouth slapped him in the face with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">string of Sioux scalps, called him a "child,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked how long before he could grow up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kill a Sioux.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The buck, maddened beyond self-control</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knowing the warriors were watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shame, grabbed for his ax. Flat Mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled evilly and dangled the string before</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face. The hand on the ax relaxed. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was using the medicine bag taken from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war-chief killed in the Red Lake River</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, as a tobacco pouch. Now I pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced it, filled my pipe and through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pillager advised the young man and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend not to bother mighty warriors who</seg><seg type="columnLine">never bothered to slay any but chiefs</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying the pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The display of scalps and the sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the medicine pouch brought the elders to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp attention. Several approached, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing very decorous, and questioned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pillager. He proudly proclaimed himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hero and gave his new name of Sioux</seg><seg type="columnLine">Killer. He declared I came next to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said the white woman with the medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cine hair was more powerful than both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lowering glances continued, yet your</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibit of trophies had made a deep im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression and forced their respect. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">great chief, Le Borgne, would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud to recite the coups the Pillager had</seg><seg type="columnLine">recounted. Harsh commands were given,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the band of children drew back, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">young men ceased their insolence, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women clubbed the dogs to the outskirts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Le Borgne's brother, Caltahcota,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Choke-cherry, as the traders knew him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deigned to make himself known and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired minutely into the purpose of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit. He was pleased with the story I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the Pillager, and said his brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be very glad to welcome us, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had done wrong in not bringing guns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder and ball with us, as the Sioux were</seg><seg type="columnLine">very thick and troublesome around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Pillager sneered and loudly declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would drive the Sioux away and double</seg><seg type="columnLine">the length of his string. Choke-cherry</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to accept him at his own estimation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his respect took on a touch of awe. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted we go into his hut and eat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We followed him and were presented with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowls of meat that only one word can</seg><seg type="columnLine">describe--putrid. Even for politeness' sake</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not endure the stench of it, let alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">tasting it. Choke-cherry gobbled at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">voraciously and gave us some dried beans</seg><seg type="columnLine">and corn, bruised in a mortar, cooked with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out salt, and very tasteless. Still it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be swallowed. Flat Mouth was not par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular as to what he ate, yet there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">limits to even his Indian appetite and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach. He partook only of the corn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beans. While we were bolting our portions</seg><seg type="columnLine">he assured me that the Minnetarees would</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill a buffalo in Winter, leave it in the snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wait until decomposition had set in</seg><seg type="columnLine">before using it for food. I could well</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ESCAPING to the free air, I asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Choke-cherry when his mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother would lje back. He be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved in a few days. He was very vague,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicating he knew no more about it than</seg><seg type="columnLine">we did. The six Cheyenne envoys had</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrawn a mile north of the village to</seg><seg type="columnLine">await the coming of more of their people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upon their arrival the treaty between them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Minnetarees would be duly ce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented. The Minnetarees would adopt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Cheyenne youth and many presents</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be "placed under the stem." While</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Borgne was too big a man to abandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hunting trip for any purpose except to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow his own will, it was probable he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">return very soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the Pillager interpreting I said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">H4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must go back lo the lower villages to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.

Fear of the Sioux would keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village Indians from pursuing us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the presence of the Cheyennes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Knife, anxious to make peace, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">tend to make both Sioux and Assiniboins</seg><seg type="columnLine">chary about remaining in that neighbor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mandans, while peacefully disposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and much less arrogant than the Minne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarees, were known as dogged fighters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allied with the Cheyennes, they could carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good fight to the Sioux, and the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it. By striking directly north and</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling much by night I believed we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the big loop of the Mouse. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">following the Mouse a short distance we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be within the sphere of influence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the N. W. Company, represented by Fort</seg><seg type="columnLine">Assiniboin, and our dangers from hostile</seg><seg type="columnLine">red men would be over. Nor did I expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">any difficulty in leaving the Mandan</seg><seg type="columnLine">village. We had come and gone as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased, our story was believed, and we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">visited the Minnetaree village to consult</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Le Borgne's brother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaving Choke-cherry -- Cherry-on-a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bush was his full name, I believe--we re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the hut and found Miss Dearness</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated on a robe before the empty firehole</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looking very' sad. I briefly explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">my purpose, and it was worth great risks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to behold the wonderful lighting up of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes as she turned them on me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will succeed!" she cried in English.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It must!

The effect at once regis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered on the Pillager. Smoothing out her</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful hair, she softly sounded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ululating call that carried the whispering</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wind and the prattling of shallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivers. The chief stood very straight, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head tipped back, his nostrils distended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a warrior's ambition in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">small eyes.

The hand that struck against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe where hung his scalps was itching for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more bloody work. Then the door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut swung open, and Choke-cherry stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us, blinking at the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE WAS wearing a gorgeous head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gear made from a turkey-cock's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail, and he seemed much puffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with his own importance. For a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments he forgot his errand and stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Miss Dearness and her lustrous hair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With an effort he recalled his business and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a loud voice, began reciting. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked he pounded his chest and glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">from me to the girl and then to the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passive Pillager. When he had finished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pillager explained that the messenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent to inform Le Borgne of the Cheyennes'</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence at the village had found the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief a short distance up the Knife. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being a great chief, it did not please his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancy to quit the hunt, even for making</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peace treaty. Accordingly he had sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the messenger back with directions for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother, the renowned and redoubtable</seg><seg type="columnLine">Choke-cherry, to treat with the Cheyennes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to adopt the Cheyenne youth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These delegated powers had swollen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Choke-cherry's conceit almost to the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploding point. Out of*, five brothers to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Borgne he had been picked. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent word to the Cheyenne camp that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coming to act for his illustrious brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, to give more tone to the cere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony, he desired his new friends to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Dearness' face remained cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and proud, but her soul was on her lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she whispered to me:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God he isn't coming.

Her at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendance was absolutely necessary, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'd better come," I urged after Flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mouth had interpreted.

As Choke-cherry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warriors would have laughed at him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the mouth-piece of his illustrious brother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his orders were obeyed with great celerity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our horses were brought to the hut, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buck who acted as hostler did not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause to beg for the usual piece of trade</seg><seg type="columnLine">tobacco. We found the village humming</seg><seg type="columnLine">with unusual activity, and Choke-cherry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every few rods, halted his pony and hoarsely</seg><seg type="columnLine">harangued the people. These speeches</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no point, I deduced from Flat Mouth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim smile of contempt, but they killed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time which I believed to be precious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally we were ready and rode beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">Choke-cherry at the head of two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more mounted warriors. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decorated their ponies with white and red</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, some showing white or red hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prints to advertise that their riders had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grappled bare-handed with an enemy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Others were marked with stripes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The riders, too, were painted, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been very ferocious to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold even without any coloring, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">majority of them showed wide welts in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh, produced by pushing an arrow-head</seg><seg type="columnLine">along under the skin. Many had several</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these hideous ridges running from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to the shoulder and then down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chest, where^lhey ended in a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">circles. Nearly all had scalps hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their bridles or from the handles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their axes and spears. The women, also</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted, brought up the rear. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">were uniformly tattooed with broad lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the nose to the cars, and from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comers of the mouth down to the throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we galloped along behind Choke-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cherry, Flat Mouth festooned his scalps</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the front of his robe, while I hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sioux medicine pouch on my breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Several groups of young men now swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ahead of us, riding ten abreast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanting their war-songs and sounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">their rattles. Choke-cherry produced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremonial pipe from a case carried across</seg><seg type="columnLine">his saddle, and held it high in one hand so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it could not touch his horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, while we went in superior numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sign a peace pact, yet we moved in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">compact body as if fearing an attack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor was this because of any ceremony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were afraid of an attack. Word was</seg><seg type="columnLine">given for the young men to cease racing</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ponies and stay close with the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, and more than one of the gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearers saw that his piece was properly</seg><seg type="columnLine">primed and slipped an extra ball into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When, within about a quarter of a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Cheyenne camp, a score of warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">came racing out to meet us, on horse-flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was far superior to anything the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minnetarees owned, their animals' heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">were cunningly concealed in masks repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senting buffalo and red deer heads. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">riders were all young men and they rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to us, shook hands and cried out greet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings in their own language.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On beholding Miss Dearness they seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely affected and lost much of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisy manner. Flat Mouth and his decora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions also impressed them, although he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore none of the finery the Minnetarees</seg><seg type="columnLine">were displaying. But he had the proof of</seg><seg type="columnLine">having been at hand-grips with the Sioux.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they galloped back to their camp they</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeatedly turned to gaze at us. Choke-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cherry took all this to his own credit, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew it was the girl and her vivid hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">that attracted these backward glances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She, too, was moved by the stirring spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacle, and her blue eyes flashed and sparkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and roamed back and forth to take in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the details of the lively panorama. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment she was forgetting the filth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the annoyance and was beholding only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barbaric grace of the riders, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictorial rioting of colors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Choke-cherry, the old wind-bag, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted the long line and rode from front</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rear, pausing every rod to spout and roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">his orders, determined to live his brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority to the limit. He lectured them</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the virtue of keeping their finery un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soiled, so as to do honor to their tribe. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhorted them to carry themselves care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, so as to give no offense and spoil the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentlemen of the North</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">peace. He severely scolded a band of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mandans, who rode at one side and out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. Flat Mouth said the Mandans had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand much overbearing conduct from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their allies, but added that, aside from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Borgne, no Minnetaree ventured beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain limits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Because of Choke-cherry's love for</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech-making I feared we would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the camp and have the ceremony</seg><seg type="columnLine">of adoption done with, but fortunately a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great war-chief of the Cheyennes now</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed out to meet us on a white stallion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put an end to our leader's mouthing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This man was a magnificent specimen. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore a blue coat, procured in trade with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spaniards through some of the southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribes, and a gaily striped blanket. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">all but rode us down and had his horse's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoofs pawing the air over my head in a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">disconcerting manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook hands with me 'and Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dearness, at whom he stared overlong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with the Pillager. Choke-cherry, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a few hundred feet behind us, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">galloped up and fussily took over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">management of the situation. The chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook hands with him cordially, but his gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternated between the girl's hair and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern cold face of the Pillager with his wealth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sioux hair. The business of handshaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">done with, he fell back, and a large number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his men rode forward and mingled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Minnetarees and Mandans, shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and shouting a welcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT A signal from their chief the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheyennes fell into long lines with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">military precision and galloped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their camp. We followed at a sedate pace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When we arrived, the chief and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the older men rode back and forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the camp, reminding their people</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Minnetarees were their friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were to be fed and protected</seg><seg type="columnLine">from thieves. There were a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather tents in the camp, white as snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and set in a horseshoe with the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the north. The speech of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheyennes is much more pleasing to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear than that of the Mandans or Minne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarees and reminded me much of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">northern Crees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus far all had gone smoothly. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a bolt, a band of Cheyennes darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their camp and rode like mad along</seg><seg type="columnLine">our back trail. At first I supposed this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to be one of their graceiul maneuvers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but quickly perceived by Choke-cherry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement that something unusual was up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He yelped to his warriors and two-score</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled their horses and started on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">course parallel to that of the Cheyennes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I rode up a low hill to discover the trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beheld two horsemen desperately</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding to meet the Minnetarees before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheyennes could get to them. Behind me</seg><seg type="columnLine">both the Cheyenne camp and the body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minnetarees were in a boiling commotion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The women accompanying our party were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly getting the horses to the rear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Choke-cherry was bleating madly. Flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mouth and Miss Dearness galloped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">join me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be ready! We may have to ride fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">from here. If we do we will strike for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mouse without going back to the Mandan</seg><seg type="columnLine">village," said the Pillager.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I asked for an explanation. He pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the two horsemen, now inside the double</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of Minnetarees. I looked and recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized the head-dress of buffalo horns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Assiniboins!" I cried. "Why don't the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minnetarees kill them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '"They came into the village. They can</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be harmed. The Cheyennes are their</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly enemies. Knowing the Minnetarees</seg><seg type="columnLine">are stronger today than the Cheyennes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they foolishly followed them out here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Cheyennes want to kill them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minnetarees say they shall not be hurt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead of peace we may have a battle. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">that happens we will ride for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the Minnetarees were returning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two Assiniboins in their midst. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheyennes shouted furiously and gesticu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated with their weapons as they demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surrender of the newcomers. Choke-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cherry rode up to the Cheyenne chief and</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked him to call his young men back. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief offered ten of his best horses for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Assiniboins, and there was no logical</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason--the dictates of humanity aside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which the Minnetarees knew nothing--</seg><seg type="columnLine">why the intruders should not ha-*e been</seg><seg type="columnLine">given up. But according to the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoning the two were safe once they</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the village and so long as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained in the village. As almost all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village had gone to visit the Cheyennes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Assiniboins followed our road and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">held to be, theoretically, still in the village</seg><seg type="columnLine">and entitled to protection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a curious example of the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">n8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of custom. The Minnetarees were deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined to protect the two hostile Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if it cost them the friendship of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheyennes. The men were finally brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">well within our lines, thrust into a small tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and told to keep out of sight. Next fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed an hour of vehement speech-making.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last the Cheyennes said they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">get their chance later. Choke-cherry was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous and uneasy and at once began</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparing for the ceremony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Dearness became so deeply inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested in the Assiniboins that I made some</seg><seg type="columnLine">comment upon it. She replied:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They were with those who drove us</seg><seg type="columnLine">down here. They are spies. They came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn if we were here, and when we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to go. Their main body is in hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere near."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They must not go back to tell what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they've learned," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, not murder," she protested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Self-defense," I grimly qualified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to the Pillager and found him</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly composed. He said he had known</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment he beheld the two, that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">errand on the Knife concerned us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I said to the girl:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's very simple. I'll get word to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheyennes to watch the two and bag them</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they leave the village. Flat Mouth shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell them, as he talks the sign language."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But the war-party outside waiting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch us?" she murmured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Flat Mouth shall tell of that, too. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheyennes shall go and drive them away."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began to feel rather obliged to the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows for coming in and revealing the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspected danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So far as I could observe, the wrangling</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the Assiniboins terminated without</seg><seg type="columnLine">any obvious gain made by either side except</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Minnetarees kept the two Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive. With the dissension smoothed away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">next came the ceremony of completing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treaty. The terms were simple and ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted by both tribes. The alliance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wage war on the Sioux and their allies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Choke-cherry, by formally adopting a Chey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enne youth as his son, would be creating</seg><seg type="columnLine">binding ties between the tribes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheyennes, however, were reluctant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceed with the business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flat Mouth got hold of a Mandan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned the Cheyennes were angry that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Borgne did not consider the treaty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough importance to be present. It had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">only needed the incident of the Assiniboins</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring this resentment to the surface.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The medicine-tent was not up, nor had they</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a smaller ceremonial horseshoe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white leather tents. After much argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and oratory the medicine tent was</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally erected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Choke-cherry made a long-winded speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">and called to him Two Crows, a Minne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taree chief, and gave to him the long pipe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stem he had so carefully guarded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">being profaned by touching his horse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This stem was adorned with feathers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two Crows, in accepting it, danced gro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tesquely back and forth, while two young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minnetarees beat on a drum and rattled</seg><seg type="columnLine">antelope hoofs together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a certain amount of prancing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the ceremonial visit to the tent of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheyenne who was to be adopted. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crows went ahead with his thudding dance</seg><seg type="columnLine">step, and behind him danced the men with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drum and the hoofs. We followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Choke-cherry. At Choke-cherry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">command three horses were brought along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several pegs were pulled out, and the flaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tent drawn back so that the horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be led inside. The three halters were</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed in the hands of a very sullen looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man who was seated opposite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance. Two Crows danced up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered him the sacred stem. To the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sternation of Choke-cherry the stem was</seg><seg type="columnLine">haughtily waved aside. Choke-cherry tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reason with him, but he would not come</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of his sulks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE situation was growing serious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flat Mouth gained the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheyenne war-chief, who was sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">donically watching Choke-cherry's em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrassment, and talked rapidly with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand masked by his robe. Only the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">could read his talk, and, as he compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hended, his eyes darted fire. Striding to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young man he spoke in his ear, whereat</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stem was accepted. Choke-cherry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two Crows now took him by the arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">led him to the medicine-tent and seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">him beside some new red strouds--coarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankets. Choke-cherry sat on his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Two Crows on his left. The musicians</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued their efforts, and a figure danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with the head of a buffalo on his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, the nostrils and mouth of which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuffed with dried grass. He placed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentlemen of the North</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">119</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">skull of a bull on the ground opposite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheyenne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now came the gift-making, and again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheyennes held back. Some of the Minne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarees brought ammunition and placed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the strouds, and the Cheyenne held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stem over it. Two Crows rose and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed the Cheyennes, urging them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring something to put under the stem.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After much waiting three warriors brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a few robes and some dressed leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">and piled them on the ammunition. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">encouraged the Minnetarees, and they gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">three guns. The Cheyennes came back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with three poor ponies. Choke-cherry</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled and grunted in great wrath, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his followers brought two more guns and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some corn and beans. This resulted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another sore-backed nag from the visitors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then did Choke-cherry explode and</seg><seg type="columnLine">demand what the Cheyennes meant by</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting worthless creatures under the stem</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the Minnetarees were giving good</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns and powder and ball. The Cheyennes</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied they would bring good horses when</seg><seg type="columnLine">more guns were put under the stem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Choke-cherry forgot diplomacy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundly accused the Cheyennes of plotting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to induce the Minnetarees to give up their</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons so that they might be helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">before an attack. This accusation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">treachery was immediately followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cheyennes hurrying back to the tents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We waited, thinking they were gone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring more ponies. Then the warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the medicine tent began calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">out loudly, and we ran after Choke-cherry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Two Crows and beheld the Cheyennes</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking their tents and preparing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young man who was to have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">adopted galloped by us, riding one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gift nags, leading the others and carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guns and ammunition. More than one</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow was drawn taut as he flew by, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Choke-cherry, although convulsed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage, knew better than to let war come</seg><seg type="columnLine">while his brother was absent, and his stern</seg><seg type="columnLine">commands, liberally mixed with mention</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his brother's name, saved the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Cheyennes rode off in a body. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace treaty had fallen through because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Assiniboins. Yet the Minnetarees</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not seem to attribute any blame to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and treated them kindly as we rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the village. Before arriving at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the huts Choke-cherry turned toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, a mile away. On reaching it he</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed Two Crows to bring a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffalo hide. Flat Mouth explained to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the girl that Choke-cherry feared he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had handled the peace treaty badly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anticipated his brother's anger. To guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">against this he now proposed to sacrifice</seg><seg type="columnLine">a precious white robe. Such a hide, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have remarked before, is the most highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">valued by the Minnetarees of all their</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessions. I could understand how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief's brother was considerably worked up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two Crows came galloping back, not with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whole hide, for that was a liberality that</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the gods had no right to expect, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long strip. This seemed to answer per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly, however, and was soon placed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep hole in the river and weighted down</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rocks. Choke-cherry then made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long speech in which he said he knew what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to blame for the Cheyennes' behavior,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he promised to duly report to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother. Having done all he could to</seg><seg type="columnLine">placate his gods, he morosely led the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You talked with the Cheyenne chief?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I murmured to Flat Mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is Red Arrow, a brave warrior. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">will wait three days to go with us to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mouse."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why is he willing to do that?" I curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He knows I will pay him. He will make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good trade," was the evasive answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Choke-cherry halted at the first hut and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we rode up, he glared at me viciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouted something. The Pillager in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terpreted--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know what stopped me from making</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace with the Cheyennes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was it?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bad medicine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was the medicine?" I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he would say before he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The hair of the white woman," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted, switching his malignant gaze to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Dearness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I warmly replied he was a fool and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other things, and that no treaty would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made with the Minnetarees when they took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Assiniboin snakes along with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My brother is a very wise man. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall see," he replied as he rode away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The girl had interpreted his look and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Flat Mouth's Chippewa translation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her hand was cold as ice as she rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">120</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">closer and placed it on mine and whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It all comes back--my fear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you worry a bit," I soothed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll get out of here flying inside of twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In my heart, however, a deadly chill was</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was now dusk, and, after leaving our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponies at the corral, I escorted Miss Dear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness to the hut and lighted some bark in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire-hole to drive away the gloom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I told her that we had better remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we were until morning as the ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the river would be dangerous. Sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding the village were innumerable pits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight feet or more deep, which the women</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with corn and beans each Fall. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all open, and to get clear of the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night was to risk a broken leg or neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we must get away tonight," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercely insisted. "Any danger but this."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She waved her hand to encompass the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole village. "You heard what he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">about my medicine spoiling the treaty. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">care nothing for that, but there is another</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger. Oh, Mr. Franklin, you've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">very good and patient with me--but get me</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of here tonight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well, we'll go tonight, but we can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to the Mandans.

If we waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">until tomorrow and started from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mandans we might find a band of Chey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ennes waiting to act as escort.

"Perhaps Flat Mouth could swing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side and pick up the Cheyennes. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, then a ride for it, and a clean, quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">death at the worst."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There must be no talk of death," I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">buked.

His hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck my chest to push me aside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the Pillager's voice was whispering--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So it is you. I knew the cloth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the trouble? You've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">running?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last deduction was not because his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing was beyond normal, but because</seg><seg type="columnLine">in clutching his wrists I felt his pulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">racing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Assiniboin spies will not go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell what they saw here," he hissed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God!

Lights were</seg><seg type="columnLine">now springing up in the open places, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked children dancing and piling on fuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looking like so many devil's whelps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before I reached the corral the village</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well illumined. I met Choke-cherry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who bawled out something I could not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood even if I knew his language.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as he carried a gun and had his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuffed with balls, I assumed he was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecting an attack from the Cheyennes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He caught my arm and led me to the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a hut and ordered the mob to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side. As the command was obeyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked down a narrow lane of humanity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beheld the two Assiniboins. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been killed with a knife, and both were</seg><seg type="columnLine">scalped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I slashed my lingers across my wrist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sign for the Cheyennes, and he nodded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stopped to harangue the crowd and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked clear of the shambles and hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to the corral.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I reached the corral and was startled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">behold a line of mounted men riding down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slight rise and toward me, being well</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the light of the many fires. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they were continually descending</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rise, the head of the line never reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corral. I watched for a minute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly puzzled. Then a stentorian voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose with such tremendous volume as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry a great distance. It was repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">several times and was answered from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the village. In another moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">several Indians came running by the corral,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them swinging a torch. I recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">Choke-cherry and the Pillager in the group.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I called out to him and I knew he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, yet he kept on with the others to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man with the loud voice. Knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would return when he had finished his</seg><seg type="columnLine">errand, I proceeded to pick out our animals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I led them out of the enclosure a warrior</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught my arm and pointed interrogatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the nags. I pointed out toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open plain and then made the sign for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheyenne and indicated I was taking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses into a hut. He nodded and hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. I started to lead them away and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand fell on my shoulder, and the Pillager</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wrenching the halter ropes from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and hurriedly driving the ponies back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the corral.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why do you do that?" I demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bad medicine at work," he gloomily</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered. "Le Borgne comes back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunt. Did you not hear his voice?</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he heard the noise in the village he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew something was wrong and has thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred of his hunters around the village</seg><seg type="columnLine">with orders to shoot any one trying to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. We must stay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a word I followed him back</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the excited throngs. Some per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse agency seemed to be thwarting us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something of the girl's strange fear began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to assail me. It was not Le Borgne, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball from my double-barrel would nicely</seg><seg type="columnLine">eliminate him. It was, rather, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole village stood for ruthless and brutal</seg><seg type="columnLine">domination through physical strength.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I came to the hut, tapped on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, and gave my name, I was confront-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the hardest task I had ever encountered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                 TO BE CONCLUDED.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Author ot "The Snake," and "The Sloth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WOULD not attack that spider again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">senhor, if I were you. You have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">for yourself that you can not hit him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">â ^*No matter how quickly you strike, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is inches away when the blow falls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those huge, bird-killing spiders all are</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredibly swift. I have heard that not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a bullet is fast enough to kill one--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that at the flash of the gun he jumps so</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly that the whole seven inches of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">is out of danger when the shot strikes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whether that be true or not, I know you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will never hit him with your fist; you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">only tire yourself out. Besides, he may</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow angry and attack you in return.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His fangs are half an inch long, senhor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is full of poison. It js not wise to risk</seg><seg type="columnLine">his springing at y&lt;ju.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is an odd place to find such a mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster--here in the middle of the broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amazon, on a steamer outward bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Atlantic. Yet strange creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes come aboard these river-boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">while they are tied up at the bank. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them are harmless, and some are deadly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And not all of the deadly things are found</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the outgoing steamers, nor are they</seg><seg type="columnLine">all bred here in the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sometimes they come up the river from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside and are the more deadly because</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are human. The memory of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them came into my mind just now while I</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched that great spider leaping aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">from your blows. He, too, was called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "Spider," that man, though his name</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Schwartz.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What is that? You say that schwarz</seg><seg type="columnLine">means "black"? That is very droll, senhor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Spider was black. Black of hair,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">black of beard, black of eye he was--yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and black of heart, too, though at first we</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know that. We called him Spider</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he looked like one. His little</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were set close together with a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spidery look in them. His body was small</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bunchy, while his arms were long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin and covered with black hair. His legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were short and crooked. Yet he could run</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazingly fast on those little legs; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him seen all the more like a spider.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And later he made himself a spider's lair--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came to a spider's end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An up-river boat brought him to us one</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, and with him a small brown bag and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rifle. He had no letters to Coronel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nunes, owner of the great rubber estate</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I worked, nor anything else to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">who he was or whence he had come. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">coronel, however, received him with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">courtesy he shows to all who come to him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when this man told him he had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">another bag, containing letters of intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duction and other things of value, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been stolen from him on the boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coronel believed him--or at any rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to, for theft is a tiling that may</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen to any man in almost any place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schwartz boldly-made himself at home</seg><seg type="columnLine">there at the headquarters and talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely about looking over the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the people he said he represented. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out in ihe jungle with us men and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">all he could see. Always he carried two</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons--the rifle, and a pistol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It may be a foolish fancy, senhores,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I have sometimes thought that a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be judged by his weapons, and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the man himself, but the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Spider</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whence he comes--for a man usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">carries the weapons made in his own land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now you two Americans, I have noticed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry with you that flat pistol made by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senhor Colt, which you say was used by</seg><seg type="columnLine">your army in the war in Europe. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is about it a square, solid look which fits</seg><seg type="columnLine">well with the things I have observed about</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and with what I have heard about</seg><seg type="columnLine">your great country. Also, the shape of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that pistol is such that it seems to say--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not seek trouble with any man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but if any man wants it--I am ready."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Your Winchesters, too, have something</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that same air of solid readiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guns of the Spider had a much</seg><seg type="columnLine">different appearance. The pistol looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">venomous; it leaned forward from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly butt to the thin muzzle, as if always</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager to kill. It reminded me of a striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake. The name of it, he once told me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a Loo--let me see--ah yes, that is it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">senhor--a Luger. The rifle, too, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">wicked, but I can not remember its name;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it does not matter. But that pistol and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the look of the spidery man who carried it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were such that, when he was following</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me in the bush, I got a cold feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">between my shoulder-blades, as if death</seg><seg type="columnLine">were about to strike me in the back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My mates, too. said that they had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same feeling when he was behind them;</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet he gave us no real cause for it. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not bluster nor threaten us by word or act.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indeed, he was very quiet. He had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider's way of remaining still in one place</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long time, watching everything and</seg><seg type="columnLine">making no move. It might be our work</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he watched, or it might be something</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the jungle that aroused his interest; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever it was, you felt that when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped looking at it he had seen everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it and remembered it all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thing that amused us was his habit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of watching other spiders--real spiders of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bush, which we often met. No matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">what sort of spider it might lie he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">study it and learn its .ways and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">it lived and got its prey. When he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">this we would wink at one another and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh behind our hands, and one of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mates named Pedro--a tall, handsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">young fellowr who was very droll--would</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretend to pounce on something, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">say under his breath:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Take care, little spider, the big Spider</seg><seg type="columnLine">will eat you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed very funny to us at the time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But later on things came about which made</seg><seg type="columnLine">it not funny at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After he had been among us for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, another boat came. It brought us</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome guests: the coroncl's daughter, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had journeyed all the way from Rio to</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit him, and her cousin, a gentleman of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rio, Senhor Affonso da Fonseca. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">year the Senhorita Flora made this long</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip from the great city where she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiving the finest education the coronet's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth could give her, to see her lonely old</seg><seg type="columnLine">father. And though he would never allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to remain very long, lest she become ill</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the climate or meet some mischance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from snakes or other things, we all knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he looked forward to these short visits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hers as the brightest days of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We knew, too, that he planned eventually</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make his own home again in Rio, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had lived until his wife died. And we</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew also that Senhor Alfonso, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat older than the senhorita, had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper feeling for her than that of a cousin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that, though he accompanied her</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly because he was interested in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber country and partly because he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">it his duty to protect her on the long jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney, he came more for the pleasure of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her. We were glad of this, Jor she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a 'handsome, gracious girl--the true</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter of her father--while the senhor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was every inch a man and would make her</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fine husband. The coronet himself ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved the match.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      NOW it happened just at this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I met with a rather bad acci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent in the bush--my right leg was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut by a nuichete--and so I had to go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to headquarters to let the injury heal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My old coronet had a very friendly feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me because in past days I had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">some dangerous things for him which many</seg><seg type="columnLine">men would not have done. So, while I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovering from my hurt, he often had me</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the house and sit and talk to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, being there, I saw a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For one thing, I noticed that the Spider</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped going into the jungle so much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stayed around the headquarters, sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet for hours in that spidery way of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watching the senhorita or Senhor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Affonso. Sometimes he talked, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">124</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">throaty foreign way, and the others an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered him with all politeness, but I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that none of them liked him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The coronel was displeased at the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spider's eyes followed his daughter, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl herself avoided him. Senhor Af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fonso, though, was much interested some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times by the black-bearded man's talk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things he had studied in the jungle, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then he went out with him to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">those things for himself. At such times</seg><seg type="columnLine">I always felt uneasy, and Senhorita Flora,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, kept watching anxiously until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mind you, senhores, the Spider never had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done anything to make us distrust him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But dark crimes can easily be committed</seg><seg type="columnLine">when two men are alone in the bush, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew that Senhor Affonso was wealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that, no doubt, he had a tempting sum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of milreis with him; and, as I have said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was that about the Spider which made</seg><seg type="columnLine">one feel that it would not be well to trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">him too far. So I always felt relieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the Rio gentleman came back un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmed, and I knew the senhorita did also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she never spoke of what was in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then one day a man of ours reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing a splendid black jaguar in the forest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Senhor Affonso and the Spider went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunt it. They made the longest trip they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had yet taken, for they were gone tfto days.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time we were more at ease about them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, for by the coronel's order two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our men went with them--the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen the jaguar and another who was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good hunter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not long after they departed,another boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. It was the one which had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spider to us. My leg was better now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though still stiff, and I limped down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch the unloading of the â¢ supplies. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">I started, the coronel asked me to request</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain to come up for a moment. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so and thought no more of it. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat went, though, I noticed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coronel seem disturbed. At times his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">would snap angrily and then he would walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down, his face wrinkled in thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I asked no questions, of course, but after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spider and Senhor Affonso returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">I soon learned what was the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had found the jaguar, and brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them his great, glossy hide, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senhor Affonso proudly showed to the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her father.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It shall go back to Rio with us," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at Flora, and there Was that in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face which added: "And some day, beloved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it shall be in our home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled and blushed a little, dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I do not know why I did it, but I glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Spider to see if he wat-ched this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw he did and that a nasty expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed his face. The coronel saw this too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his mouth tightened. When the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">started into the house he said--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Senhor Schwartz, I would speak with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to go away. But, as I have said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my leg was stiff, and I had to walk slowly--â¢</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I will admit that I did not try very</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to hasten, for I knew the coronel was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to say something worth hearing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before I had gone far the old gentleman</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Senhor, you have now made me quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long visit. I have greatly enjoyed your</seg><seg type="columnLine">companionship and I am grieved that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this poor home of mine I have been unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to offer you better entertainment. I trust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, that the little I could do to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">you the workings of the estate has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some assistance to you, and that on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure you will carry with you many</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant memories."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Spider said nothing. So the corond</seg><seg type="columnLine">added--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is with sorrow that I learn that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are to leave us on the next boat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a pause the Spider said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ya, I see. It is because I lost that bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit my papers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pardon, senhor," said the coronel, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Aurora was here yesterday, and as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are my guest I asked the captain if any</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace of your black bag, of which you told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, had been found. He told me, senhor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you had no black bag whatever--only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brown one which you brought here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that nothing had been taken from you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No doubt there is some mistake. Yet I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have known this captain for years, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know him to be honest and truthful."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was another pause. Just as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed out of hearing the Spider said--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is a-liar, but I will go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard him walk into the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As no boat was expected for a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">things went on as before. I said nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what I had overheard and I know the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coronel did not tell the others, for he is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Spider</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">125</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">very soul of hospitality and it had cost him</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unpleasant struggle to do what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do. The Spider went out into the bush</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few times alone and returned and talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">of various things he had seen. Then one</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning he and Senhor Affonso went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, to look at something or other</seg><seg type="columnLine">this black-hearted man said he had found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I watched them go and I became more</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasy than ever before. I wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow, but my leg was not yet good enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let me travel easily and noiselessly; so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked about, and my eye fell on young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro, the droll fellow who used to pretend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to devour spiders. I beckoned to him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered to him to follow the pair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep out of sight. He did so at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TIME passed, and a sort of drowsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness had crept upon me, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came a sound--a sound like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shot, some distance away and muffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the bush. I sprang awake and listened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly I remembered that Pedro had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not taken his rifle--only the machete he</seg><seg type="columnLine">always carried at his belt. Senhor Affonso,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, had a gun with him and he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be shooting at some animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before long there came two other shots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These were nearer than the first and sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the spiteful crack of the Luger. I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and went to my quarters to get my rifle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senhorita Flora who had heard the shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, come out and called to me--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lourenfo, what is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I made no answer and went on as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast as a lame man could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was just coming out with the gun when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flora's name was called from the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest. There stood the Spider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come quickly, senhorita " he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Affonso has met with an accident."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She started running toward him. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">called--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do not go, senhorita! Wait!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she kept on, and I began to run too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the Spider stopped us both. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bullet missed me so narrowly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt it pass my face. I dodged, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumsy stiff leg twisted, and I fell sprawling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I looked up the girl had whirled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was running back to the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Spider, who thought he had killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, was running after her with all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spidery speed. My rifle had fallen from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hand, and while I was getting it he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">caught her. He dragged her back toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle. She struggled to escape, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he struck her so hard that he dazed her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he picked her up and ran, but I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">my rifle now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I fired from where I lay, aiming low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to hit his crooked legs and so avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">injuring Flora. But I shot hurriedly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed him. Still, my shooting stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, for when he saw I was alive he swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl toward me and, using her as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shield, fired at me again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As you perhaps know, a man lying down</seg><seg type="columnLine">is hard to hit, but his bullet ripped across</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoulders and tore the shirt from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and burned my skin. I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot again without striking the senhorita,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I did not try.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came a burst of fire from the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the coronel had seized weapons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he came bounding out like a jaguar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a pistol in each hand spitting flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lead, as he ran. Somewhere behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, too, a rifle barked, fired by some man</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, both the coronel and the work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man shot high, lest they kill Flora. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spider, thinking only of himself, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time to realize this. Finding himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">under fire from two directions and hearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">yells of rage as other men ran for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, he suddenly dropped the girl and ran,</seg><seg type="columnLine">diving into the bush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shot at him again as he fled, but again</seg><seg type="columnLine">I missed. Then we all hastened to Flora,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom the coronel had caught up in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms. For the moment we forgot every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing but her. Then, still stunned by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow of the Spider, she moaned--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Affonso!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We all started and looked at one another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I said--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Senhor Affonso must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot--and Pedro, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I explained how I had sent Pedro to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow. The coronel snapped:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go, men, and find them! And find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that--that Schwartz, too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We growled. The Spider would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back alive if we found him. But we</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not find him, for he had vanished. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed on to find our own people. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not keep up with the others, but I was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">far behind when they met Pedro. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">came staggering down an old estrada, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face twisted with pain, and he bore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of Senhor Affonso.</seg><seg type="columnLine">12b</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first we believed that body to be dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it hung limp and there were two bullet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes in it, but while we were cutting down</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches to make a litter Senhor Alfonso</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred and moaned. Pedro cried out joy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He lives! The senhor lives!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he dropped, did Pedro, fainting</seg><seg type="columnLine">from loss of blood, for he, too, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot by the Spider, and his wound was bad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the shoulder. So now we had two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to carry home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I learned later, this was what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Spider had told Senhor Affonso he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found a trap-door spider's nest which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite the most wonderful thing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever seen, and the senhor, greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested, went with him into a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where no men were working. There the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spider pointed to a hole at the base of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large tree, with thick spider-webbing across</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and said that was it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the city gentleman had been better</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquainted with spiders he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known that no trap-door spider would</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever make such a nest, but that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be concealed so that it could not be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all. But he went up to it, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man Schwartz said--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look closely, Affonso, and see how a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider acts when he is cornered!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he shot him in the back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only thing that saved the senhor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, even as he bent to look, he sensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">something treacherous in the Spider's</seg><seg type="columnLine">words and turned to see his face. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet struck him before he had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-way, but he had twisted so far that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of going into his heart, it went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through him sidewise and came out under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right arm. The shock threw him for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and his head struck hard against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tree, knocking him senseless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Spider, thinking him dead, swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbed him of every thing valuable--though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not get so much as he probably ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected, for the senhor had put most of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">money in the coronel's safe soon after his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival. Then he dashed back to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the handsome Senhorita Flora, but on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way he met Pedro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pedro, not wishing the pair to know he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there, had followed at some distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, though he heard the shot, he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the shooting and could not be sure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it meant. So, with his machete ready,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he sought to stop the Spider and question</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Without a word the Spider shot him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, firing twice. The first bullet knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him down in the thick bush and the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed. When he struggled up again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spider was gone. Since the first thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do was to find Senhor Affonso, he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR some time it seemed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">both Pedro and the senhor would die.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But both were strong, and at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">they recovered. While they lay there we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted the Spider, but found nothing at all;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had disappeared as if he never had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been there. It was during this time, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we learned what he meant by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">double-tongued advice to Senhor Affonso</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see what a cornered spider would do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for there came a boat, and with it two quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">common-looking men who talked with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coronel and went out into the bush with</seg><seg type="columnLine">our men. They finally left without telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">their business to any one except the coronel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When they had gone we learned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprize that they were police. We also</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that they sought the Spider, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was wanted in Para for murder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at Manaos for--worse than murder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So you see that though he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the law was so close behind him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did know he could not go back down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river on the next boat. He had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last place where he could live among</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and now there was no place left for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him but the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My leg was well long before the senhor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pedro were, and I went back to work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard, though, that Senhor Affonso</seg><seg type="columnLine">vowed he would stay there until he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted down the man who had shot him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and assailed the lady Flora, if it took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The senhorita was even more bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">against that man than Affonso himself--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so much because he had attacked her</seg><seg type="columnLine">as because he had nearly killed her sweet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. That is the way of women. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">she pleaded with him not to seek the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spider, as he might be killed in doing so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The coronel, too, pointed out that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">city-bred and not fitted for man-hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">in such terrible country as ours, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spider must have perished in the jungle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that even the police had abandoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea of looking for him. Pedro, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom the senhor now had much affection,</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Spider</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">127</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">also urged him to change his mind, and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leave him to me, senhor. He is mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as yours, and I know the forest</seg><seg type="columnLine">far better than you. If ever I find him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so he was dissuaded, and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and Flora went back to Rio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE HAD long given up the Spider</seg><seg type="columnLine">as dead, for he had not much</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammunition and no way of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. Thus his weapons would soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">become useless, and then he could kill no</seg><seg type="columnLine">game to eat. We had decided he was dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I say, when strange things began to occur.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The first of these was the disappearance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Custodio Barros.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were working far out from head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters at the time, in new rubber land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we needed more supplies. Custodio</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sent down the river in his canoe to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. A long time went by, and he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we sent another man. Before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone far he met two boats coming up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from headquarters, and when he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">what ailed Custodio, the men in the boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">were astonished, for they thought he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to us. They said he had come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">got his supplies and started back; since</seg><seg type="columnLine">then nothing had been seen or heard of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their own action in bringing more supplies</seg><seg type="columnLine">had nothing to do with him, but was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual arrangement. They said they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep a sharp lookout on the way back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see if any trace 'of him could be found,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they discovered no trace at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, of course, caused much talk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">argument among us. Custodio was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest fellow and even if he had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would hardly have run away with a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplies. He might have gone ashore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and been killed by a snake or a jaguar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or he might have been drowned, or devoured</seg><seg type="columnLine">by alligators or piranhas. None of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, however, would have destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his canoe, and the empty canoe would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been seen by some one. It might be that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians had killed him and taken all he had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this did not seem likely. Each of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">had his own idea of what might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened, but none of us knew anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than the fact that he was lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gumercindo Penria was the next. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a steady, thrifty man who had worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">among us for a long time and had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambled. He had accumulated a large</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">account with the coronel. He had a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">family at a place well down the river, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now the longing for home had grown too</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong in him. and he was going out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The coronel, who is always very kind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who serve him well, not only paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">him his due but gave him a handsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">present besides, so that he was quite rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a man of this region. Yet, partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he was so thrifty and partly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause the home fever was burning strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">in him, he would not wait for a regular boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go home as a paying passenger, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">started at once in his own canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since he was going down-river, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coronel asked him to bear a message to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of our men working some distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">below headquarters, telling them to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, as he had decided to send them into</seg><seg type="columnLine">another place. Gumercindo gladly prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised to do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men did not come in, and, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting awhile, the coronel sent another</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with the same message. This time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men came promptly. They said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">senhores, that Gumercindo not only had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given them no message, but he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed their camp!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this the coronel was much perplexed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after turning things over in his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sent two men all the way to Gumer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cindo's home to see if he had arrived there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had not. Nobody knew anything at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about him. Nowhere between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headquarters and his home was there any</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of him. He, too, had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This alarmed and angered all of us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Searching parties went out with orders to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the lost man or some trace of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they hunted all along both banks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent word far down the river to seek him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But nothing was found; neither Gumer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cindo himself, nor his canoe, nor even his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that no man traveled alone. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that some terrible thing was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, though what it might be we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not guess. We made note of one thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though--that both of these men had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared with something of value. Cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">todio had vanished with some supplies;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gumercindo with money. Men who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing were not molested. Still, the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that both of those lost men had been alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they were destroyed made us want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to travel in pairs, whether we had anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not. For a time this worked well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">128</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing happened to any of us, except the</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual accidents and hazards of our work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thiyi came something that struck dread</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper into our hearts. Two men dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared together, and with them a whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat-load of valuable supplies. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, Lucas Macicl, was a rather simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow and slow of thought, but the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saldanha Saraiva, was a man of quick wit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and much experience on the river, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">only weakness was a fondness for women.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were bound up-stream when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were last seen, and somewhere between</seg><seg type="columnLine">that point and our workings the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious Death which haunted the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out and seized them, their boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all they had. As before, no trace was</seg><seg type="columnLine">left behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While we were searching along the banks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and back in the jungle for any sign of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened to these mates of ours, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifth man was swallowed up. Antonio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maciel, he was--a brother of Lucas. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the Death struck not on the water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Antonio was one of several men who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating through the bush, strung out in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long fine with wide spaces between them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was at the end of the line nearest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream. After a time the man next to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that Antonio was not answering</seg><seg type="columnLine">his calls. He cut his way toward where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Antonio should have been. He was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, nor had he reached that place. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no trace of him. He was gone, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground had opened under him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed again. The last sign of him was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where he had slashed some vines with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his machete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This was too much. Men now feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work--to go in canoes--to do anything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were not cowards, these comrades</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mine, but the mystery and silence of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful Death that left no trace was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than they could stand. Some crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves and said it was no mortal thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a demon. No man knew when or</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it would strike him down, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seized Antonio, who was on land and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had nothing but liis weapons, just as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had devoured the men on the water who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had money or supplies. Though our work</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on, we toiled always with a cold feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">on our backs, and went always by twos or</seg><seg type="columnLine">threes. There was not one of us who did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not shudder at the mention of this mysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous Death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     NOW Pedro had recovered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bullet-wound and was back at</seg><seg type="columnLine">work with me, we had many talks</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this thing which we called the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Death, but none of them got us anywhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet, through these talks, we got into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit of being together, and where one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us went the other went too. So when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was told to go to headquarters and fetch</seg><seg type="columnLine">back some things that were needed in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, Pedro came with me. At the head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters I got what we had been sent for</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as the things were few, I gave them</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to Pedro to put into the canoe while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told the coronel how all was going at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">tamo up the river. When I came out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw our canoe I was astonished. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be full of supplies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is this, Pedro?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled his odd smile, and answered:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is bait. The boxes and bags are</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with trash." And as I stared at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">he added: "The Death strikes at men with</seg><seg type="columnLine">full canoes, Lourengo. I would see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">this Death looks like."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you mad?" I cried angrily. "Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there not danger enough without inviting</seg><seg type="columnLine">more?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps so," he said, his brown eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing. "If you are afraid, we will leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">this bait behind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course that silenced me, as he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would. We pushed off and paddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with our worthless cargo. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">we swung into our long-distance stroke</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of his recklessness crept into me too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I began to look forward to meeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Death and fighting it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only thing we did meet, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far from what we half expected. At a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where a slow, quiet creek flowed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, a soft call came to us, and as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked we saw standing there an Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. We held the canoe steady and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was a magnificent woman, for she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tall and shapely, deep-bosomed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">full-hipped, and she looked as strong as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man; her face, too, was really handsome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She laughed and beckoned to us. Pedro</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed back, waved his hand and asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her what she would have of us; she made</seg><seg type="columnLine">some answer, but we could not understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, for we did not know her tongue. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she waved to us again to come ashore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pedro, who was in the bow, drove his</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddle into the river to do so, but I backed</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Spider</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">129</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">water and held the canoe where it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, though the things we had been sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">for were few, they were badly needed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">our tambo and we were under orders to</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste no time. When Pedro scowled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me I reminded him of this and told him I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had enough of his foolishness and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would go on at once. Still, we stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">there a few minutes, out on the water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he and the woman talked back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth without understanding each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all. Then we went on, paddling fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make up for lost time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sight of this woman had surprized</seg><seg type="columnLine">us much, for we knew of no Indians along</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stream--their country was farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">west and south. Had she been a man it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have seemed so strange, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages are rovers and hunt for long dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tances away from their homes; but a woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all alone on the bank, was something to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered at. We puzzled about her as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we went on and concluded that a band of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indians must be living near the stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a time, as she certainly would never be</seg><seg type="columnLine">there unless some men were about. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have said, she was the only person we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">on all our trip. The mysterious Death</seg><seg type="columnLine">never molested us. So, when we neared</seg><seg type="columnLine">our journey's end, I said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us now throw this bait overboard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It has caught no fish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well," said Pedro, and we drew up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bank to do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But suddenly, as he reached for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag, a strange look dawned in his face, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if a great thought had struck him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lourengo!" he said hoarsely. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman--I wonder if she too was bait!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I frowned at him, wondering what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant, but he did not explain. Instead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will not throw away our bait. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">will hide it and use it again. Say nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the woman, Lourenfo. I have an idea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and later you shall know what it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we hid all the trash beside the water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and marked a tree so that we could find it</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and went on to the tambo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now in this gang of ours there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent, surly man who had been a lone</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber-picker in very wild parts of Peru</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Bolivia, and who knew Indian tongues.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was said to be a refugee from both coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tries because he had killed men there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of us left him alone as much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ssible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I observed, however, that Pedro</seg><seg type="columnLine">was with him a good deal. Pedro was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of man who can make friends with</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one, and even this sour, suspicious killer</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked him. What they talked about Pedro</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not tell me, and I asked 110 questions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This went on for a time, and then one night</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro took the gang-boss aside and talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him. After that he came and told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to clean my rifle and prepare to go down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, and in the morning we went.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the place where the marked tree stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">we got our bait again, and arranged it so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it looked much different than before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we went on down-stream, ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything that might come, but nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we reached the place where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen the woman, we held the canoe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pedro gave an odd cry like a bird. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized the call as one he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">practising since he began talking wfth the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peruvian outlaw. We listened, but neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard nor saw anything, so we went on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At intervals he called again, and at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">there floated back the same call from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle. We stopped the canoe where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was. Pedro called again, and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the reply. Soon a figure appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the trees, and we saw the savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold your rifle ready, Lourenfo," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I seized the gun and cocked it, watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shore. He began to talk to the woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">using strange words which meant nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, but which she evidently understood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for she responded at once. Now I saw why</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had spent so much time with the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the west who knew Indian languages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been learning how to speak the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage dialect himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed, that woman, and chattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly to Pedro and waved to us to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her. But that we did not do. Pedro</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head, and once he pointed up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream and said more things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a time he began to paddle again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went 011 down the river and left her</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind. We passed around a bend and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then another, and when we were well out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight, he turned the canoe toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore--across the river from the bank where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman had stood. At a good place we</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed, and there he arranged our cargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to suit himself. He laughed at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">my questions and made no answer, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">130</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eves sparkled, and his face was alive with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thoughts, though at times he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little puzzled and doubtful, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he was ready we went back up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream. This time he gave no call, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we paddled steadily until we reached that</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where first we had seen the woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There he turned toward the little creek,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as we neared it I saw her again. Pedro</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made tryst with her and now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out on land and went boldly to her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stayed in the canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think there is no danger here, Lou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rengo," he said, "but be alert."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He talked more with her while I watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and everything around them. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, she chattered and laughed with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I could see that she admired him much,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was not strange, for men admired</seg><seg type="columnLine">him too--he was so tall and straight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw also that he was questioning her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that she was not answering all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions. Once she wanted to look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stuff in our boat, but I warned her off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pedro himself held her arm and stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally he stepped back into the canoe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we went on up-river until we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight. There we picked a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">to camp and stayed there that night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighting no fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before we slept, he told me that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman was living in the jungle with a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but what sort of a man he was or where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lived she would not tell him. This man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said, was away somewhere that day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what he was doing she did not know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When Pedro asked her if she would lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to the man's camp she refused. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked what we had in our boat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told her they were supplies for a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. It was then that she tried to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them and we prevented her. After that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked where this new camp was, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told her at a certain place well up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, where there really was no camp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">where none was intended. In leaving her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told her he would not work the next day</seg><seg type="columnLine">because it was his birthday, and he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to meet her again at the same place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ask you again, Pedro," I said, "what</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the meaning of all this? And why are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you so interested in this savage woman?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Louren$o." he answered, "we are now</seg><seg type="columnLine">not very far from headquarters. All of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our five friends whom the Death has struck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have disappeared not far from headquar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters--or so I believe. The place where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">first saw that woman is not far from head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters. The place where she answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">my call today is still nearer to headquarters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More than that, she answered from a spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">very near where Antonio Maciel vanished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now there is a riddle for you to puzzle over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am.going to sleep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE morning we took out all</seg><seg type="columnLine">our bait and put it into the bush.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro sat a while and watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeping shadows, and, when it was time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we went down the river again. As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddled along I said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pedro, if this woman has anything to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do with the Death, as you believe, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are fools to meet her again where you</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed, for we are likely to go into a trap</seg><seg type="columnLine">and never come out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed and replied--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If the Death is what I think it is, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">now up the river seeking that new camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which I told her, and so it can do us</seg><seg type="columnLine">no harm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed to be right, for the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited us, and they talked again for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and nothing at all happened. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that she was very much taken with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">handsome companion, but, as before, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not make her answer all his questions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After we left her he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She is no fool, Lourengo, for all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she seems so simple. Still, I think that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end we shall learn what we want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I suggested that we hasten matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">by going straight to the place where she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had answered his bird-cry and searching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle there, he snorted and replied:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes, surely. That was just what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Antonio was doing--searching the bush at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that place. And there were more men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his party than in ours. Have patience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">comrade, and do not jump in the dark."</seg><seg type="columnLine">This silenced me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We hid for the rest of that day and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, and then we went to meet her again--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the last time, as it turned out. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed sulky, and when he tried to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">her in better humor she answered crossly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we saw that something had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">since we left her. Yet Pedro finally coaxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her into a cheery mood and she began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile and give him soft looks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later I learned that she had blurted out</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Spider</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was lying to her because there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no camp where lie had said. Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that instantly showed him that his shrewd</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess had been right, and that she or her</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had sought that camp. He was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish enough to let her see his thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, and he told her that the plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been changed and the new camp was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being made at another place. After that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they talked on for some time, and he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her how handsome she was and so on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was crouched in the canoe, as usual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching everything like a cat, and listening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All at once my ear caught a tiny sound in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bush--a soft rustle as if something</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brushed stealthily against some leaves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro and the woman were talking low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I put all my attention on that little</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. It might be only a wandering</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze, a crawling snake or some other</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural thing, but I had to be sure. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard it again, very soft, and I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">something was creeping nearer to us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, at a place where the tangle was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick, I saw a slight movement caused by</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about the height of a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take care, Pedro!" I shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a flash he dodged and leaped forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing several feet away. Like a flash an</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrow sped through the place where he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been. I threw up my rifle and fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight at the spot where I had seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement; but even as my finger pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trigger I knew the bullet had missed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a violent shaking of leaves showed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man there had thrown himself sidewise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, while I was throwing another cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge into the barrel, the killing of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was taken out of my hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman sprang at the bush. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand she held Pedro's machetc, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had snatched from his belt. With that</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon she hacked and stabbed in a furv</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was terrible to see. I caught glimpses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a body writhing under her and heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarl, a broken scream and a groan. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body lay still and we heard no sound but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slash of the long knife through the leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the woman struck and struck and struck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Pedro and I were para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyzed. Then Pedro seized her and twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dripping machete from her hand. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped ashore, and while she stood shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sobbing with rage we dragged the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and looked at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For Deus!" muttered Pedro. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spider!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YES, senhores, it was the Spider.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a frightful thing to look at,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was the Spider--the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom we had thought dead and who now</seg><seg type="columnLine">truly was so. Even in death he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spider, for his arms and legs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumpled up as if something had smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. From his belt hung a narrow bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">made from a skin, ami in it were several</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows. Stepping into the place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">his woman had killed him, we found his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow--a short, clumsy but powerful weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could drive an arrow clear through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man at close range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While we were looking at this we heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragging sound and stepped out in time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the last of the Spider. With one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman was hauling him to the river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There she picked him up as if he were only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a monkey, swung him and threw him out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He struck and sank with a soggy splash.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A moment later the water began to seethe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and boil. We knew the piranhas, those</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravenous cannibal fish, were swarming</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him and chopping him into frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. So thick were they that some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were crowded up into the air, snapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">their jaws like traps. A red stain grew on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface and slowly drifted down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current with that hellish boiling going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">under it. Before long, though, the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew quiet again, and the red stain floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the woman looked at Pedro. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatred faded out of her face, her fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes softened and she took his hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">led us away into the jungle. We traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some distance and stopped at length</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a place where Pedro looked about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is where Antonio disappeared."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We could not see anything strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though at one spot the tangle of vines</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bush was very thick and matted to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, as it may be anywhere in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">forests. The woman saw we were puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she walked up to that tangle--and sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly she was gone. But she called, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we followed her. And as we reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matted vines a part of them moved out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward like a door, and there she was, laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like a little girl playing a game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Senhores, that was the Spider's nest--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lair made from the growing bushes and vines</seg><seg type="columnLine">so cunningly twisted and woven among</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves that a man could stand within</seg><seg type="columnLine">132</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet of it and never suspect that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shelter and hiding-place. If ever there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a great trap-door spider's nest, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man Schwartz had followed the trap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">door spider's example inside his den, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as outside. That spider, as you prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably know, not only makes a door which</seg><seg type="columnLine">swings shut behind him, and covers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">door with things that grow around it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he also makes a secrct pocket at the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nest, where he can hide if any enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovers his lair. And the Spider had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done this also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At one side of his den the ground rose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there he had dug a hole and covered it</seg><seg type="columnLine">over with the growing things so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody would ever know it was there. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not meant to hide in, though, but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceal the things he took from murdered</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. In that hole, when the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed it to us, we found all the property</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Custodio, Gumercindo, Saldanha and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brothers Maciel. There was Gumer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cindo's money, the supplies taken from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others and their weapons and even their</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes. But of the men themselves there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no sign anywhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Pedro asked the woman what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become of the men, she said that after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spider killed them and stripped them of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had, he did with them just what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finally done to him--threw them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the piranhas, which quickly destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their canoes, she said, he hid until</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, when he took them far up the quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">little creek where we had first seen her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, where neither flame nor smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be seen by any one, he burned them--</seg><seg type="columnLine">all except the light, fast canoe of Custodio,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he concealed very cunningly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">used himself. In this he made his spying</seg><seg type="columnLine">trips, going at night and staying away for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day or two. No doubt he had been al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most beside us more than once, lying low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching and listening with that spidery</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience of his and learning whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might kill with profit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In all these murders, the woman said, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">used the bow and arrow which was silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and easy enough to handle at close range.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In all the killings except that of Antonio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maciel he made her lure the men ashore at</seg><seg type="columnLine">some place where he lurked, ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike them down. To Custodio, Lucas</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Saldanha she had called and showed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">herself, just as she did to us, and they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her and so to their death. Gumercindo</seg><seg type="columnLine">was caught in another way, for he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewd man and was hastening home and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus was not so likely to tarry for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage woman. The Spider had had her</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay out of sight, though near the water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scream as if in great danger. Gum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ercindo, like a brave fellow he was, sped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore and dashed into the bush to save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who was in such distress. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot in the back for his pains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Antonio Maciel was killed because he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming straight at the Spider's nest with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">machete ready to cut through what he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a natural tangle. Through a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening in the side of his den the Spider</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot him and dragged him swiftly inside, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that when the other men arrived they found</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but the last place where he had cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way. That was some distance back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from where he died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We learned, too, that Pedro and I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have been the next victims, if we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come near enough. The Spider had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place down-stream where he could watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">what went on at headquarters across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, and he saw Pedro load up the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">with what looked like many supplies, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastened back and made the woman run to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that place at the creek and play her part</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we passed on our return. While she</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to bring us ashore he lurked ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill us, but when we refused to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was too wise to attack us at a distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he let us go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Pedro's foolish bait caught some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing after all, though even he did not sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect that the Spider still lived. He carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bait to see what might come of it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">later he believed that the Death was some</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When we came back and Pedro had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given the bird-call of her people, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, for the Spider was away somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">spying, and she wanted us to come ashore</seg><seg type="columnLine">only because she was hungry to talk with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who could speak her own tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After she left us at the creek she told</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spider, on his return, of our new camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all our new supplies. He went seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, came back angry and beat her. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time on she told him nothing more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us but met Pedro secretly. She did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that the Spider had followed her on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that last day until Pedro jumped, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrow flashed by him. Then her hatred</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Medicine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">133</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Spider, which had long been growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her, flamed out in the fury that destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had no love for him, but had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sold to him by her people, whom he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">met by chance in the jungle before he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the river and made his lair. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the headman his rifle for her, she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, though he had used up all his cartridges</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that the gun was useless, the headman</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the trade because women were plenti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful in his tribe but guns were very scarce,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he might be able to get cartridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She told us also that her people knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">where there was gold, and that the Spider</seg><seg type="columnLine">had planned to get much of this gold in</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade for the supplies he took from our men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus, in time, he hoped to become very</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich,'and then, perhaps, would make his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way into Peru, where he was not known,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and where he icould enjoy the wealth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gained through the deaths of honest men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So you see, senhores, it was as I told you</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the beginning--this man lived like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider and he died like one. If you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiders, you know that the female is larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stronger than the male, and that often</seg><seg type="columnLine">she turns 011 him and destroys him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that destroyed this Spider was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that he did not know this big, hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some woman's heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though I do not claim to know much of</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, yet I have observed a few and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have noticed that when a man treats a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman as something bought and paid for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time may come when lie had best be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ware of her.

"Ala-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bam" Goodloe, who hailed from Kentucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">and talked like a coon, bet a five-dollar gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece on Flood's "come-out" that night in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crap game down in House 68 on the New</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gatun road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flood threw the double six, the double</seg><seg type="columnLine">ace and the ace deuce the first three shots,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, in the natural consequence of tilings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost Alabam thirty-five dollars, for he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubling his bet each time.

His face was a brick red and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin hair and eyebrows were white as cot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, not from old age but from being born</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way, for he was nearer thirty-five than</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty. His mouth was wide and filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with short, heavy teeth. His eyes were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">china blue and stared as frankly as those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a doll's in a "Kentucky Derby" flimflam</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand at Coney Island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He looked outlandish in commissary</seg><seg type="columnLine">khakis.

This was the biggest part</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him. His voice was loud and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh a guffaw.

When</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally they had settled on the rockiest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandiest patch of land in the Mormon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valley of Idaho, he, with his natural heri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tage of gipsy blood, had set forth to ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pease his wanderlust in many lands. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had broken horses and roped steers from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alberta to Chihuahua, been a railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">"shack," miner, stage-coach driver, lumber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jack, harvest hand, trapper, hunter, Swiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide, Quaker medicine man, sailor before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mast, tropical prospector and tramp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and explorer in both arctic and antarctic</seg><seg type="columnLine">expeditions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made his advent on the Zone by walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through from Acaponeta, Mexico,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"stepping out," as he expressed it, "after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion fast and furious." Those of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had made the same walk listened with</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than casual interest and quizzed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the landmarks. He knew the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn, the big banyan tree, the deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">fisherman's hut, the broken adze, the grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">village; he could not have bluffed. Other</seg><seg type="columnLine">men made shrewd inquiries at the psycho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logical moment, for the Panama Canal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zone was a good place to get caught "out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a limb." Men who worked there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in every nook and corner of the globe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was something like the Snug Harbor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Home for sailors on Staten Island, where old</seg><seg type="columnLine">men between seventy and ninety can tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you the exact telegraph pole and window-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pane in that little obscure port you spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many of us knew that Flood's yarns were</seg><seg type="columnLine">consistent.

He had heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">negro wench talking to a sanitary inspector</seg><seg type="columnLine">in patois English; seen two naked kids</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting; one of the crane-runners had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused a bottle of beer from the water cooler</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Flood's office, and he had phoned for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambulance; a Bajan had delivered a sermon</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a group of others behind the tool house;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had sent three Castilians for a box of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamite and had had to go after them; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gallego had made a funny remark in un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grammatical Spanish--anything.

He brought to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zone expressions that remained for months</seg><seg type="columnLine">after he had gone, such as: "Shoot where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's standing without giving him time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump up;" "claw him from his forehead to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his umbilicus;" "tear him up as if the hogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">had chawed him;" "pull his eyeball out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot and flop it back into place and scare</seg><seg type="columnLine">him;" "re-Jake and back at you again with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my stack of yallers," "just barely," and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">like.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And these, dead as they look in cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">print, were replete with meaning in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of this big, red faced, white eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">browed man. lie could mimic a Swede,</seg><seg type="columnLine">any type of lime-juicer from a remittance</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to a Liverpool Gorblimme-Bill, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Western judge, any type of Spaniard, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost any other kind of man he had laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes on.

East</seg><seg type="columnLine">Texans were "boll-weevils" and "rawzum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellies" and they raised "lean do-gie"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle, whatever kind of cattle that is.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Life was one big joke shot through with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dramatic incidents, down on the porch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">House 68. No man went inside and went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed until Flood did--it wasn't any use.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's how windy he was. Men sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed the wink when he was spinning his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting yarns, and a good one hundred per</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent, said to each other behind his back that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did not think he would harm a fly; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he just liked to talk, and no one had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen him sore for so much as a second. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was out of reason that a man as good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natured as he was should ever have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble with any man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then a man moved into House 68</seg><seg type="columnLine">who did not seem to take kindly to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He also had drifted in over the trail from</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhwere or other, he didn't say just</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, and had been running a stiff-leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">derrick down at Mindi and had been trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred to one of the cranes on Flood's rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">storage dump. He and Flood had showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up walking together the first evening he</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared at House 68 and that night he had'</seg><seg type="columnLine">been one of the cirtle gathered around Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Medicine. After that they did not show up</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, and when the group gathered, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">newcomer sat far at the other end by him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. We took it for granted that Flood</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given him a call on the job and that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was peeved about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was as big a man as Flood, but of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">different type. He was tall and rangy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarthy of complexion, with a small, waxy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black mustache, quiet as a grave, dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a machine-gun, boasting of his prowess as</seg><seg type="columnLine">136</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a fighter by his silence more than Flood did</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his words. He passed no wink but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">often turned and listened gravely with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half sneer on his lips when Flood made some</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly bald assertion in regard to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight or other, and it seemed that fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become the theme of the majority of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Medicine's tales with himself the fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing son of a gun from way back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those who saw he doubted Flood's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories had little use for him. They, them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, looked on them as things to be taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sprinkling of bichloride of sodium in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spots; but he was a good entertainer. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sort of vaudeville performer, and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one expected the exact truth to the letter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No man ever went to a picture show in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Y. M. C. A. while Flood lived in House 68.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Flood wasn't afraid of this newcomer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion, or didn't appear to be. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell some outlandish story of fighting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun-play where he was the big It and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would rear back in his chair and peer</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the bunch to see how the crane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man took it. He told us in a loud aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the stranger was "Nig" Barberly, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ex-tinhorn from Salina Cruz, and that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was "pizen and meaner'n a kyotie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Further, he said little in answer to whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered queries other than that they had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been good friends and had had words on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">job over the work, and that some day he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckoned he would empty a gun into Nig's</seg><seg type="columnLine">carcass so fast it would "cut him right off</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the top of the pockets."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Barberly heard this and walked into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, soon to return with a bristling</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridge-belt buckled around him. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the crowd noticed this, but Flood</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the midst of a yarn that required all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention when Barberly reappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  From this time on we noticed that the ill</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling seemed to grow more pronounced</seg><seg type="columnLine">on both sides, Flood raising his voice many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times for Barberly's particular benefit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barberly growing more silent and sneering</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his solitary chair at the other end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These porches, by the way, were four</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms long and were heavily screened with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronze mosquito-wire. The screen door</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just opposite the door to the house in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center--information little required by</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who know Gatun and the road that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound around the top of the hill to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gatun. As a rule Flood's end of the piazza</seg><seg type="columnLine">was crowded with men who either lived in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">House 68, or neighboring quarters, or paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their pilgrimage to New Gatun and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained to get an ear-full.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE evening after supper we fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered as usual. It was during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dry season and the red sun hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">poised a few feet over the Caribbean down</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond Colon, for the sun sets in the At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantic from the C. Z. It was hot and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">men lolled in pajamas and some in gaudy</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk kimonos they had won in Chinese raffles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flood had pulled his leggings and shoes off</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sat in his shirt sleeves with his heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">braces thrown down from his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hotter than the setting sun were his</seg><seg type="columnLine">yarns of battles on blackbirders down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the South Seas when he was the bosom pal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of old Cap. Durfee. Blood flowed, snarling</seg><seg type="columnLine">lipped men sprang upon each other and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat and mauled and slashed to a fare-ye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. Desert sands glowed white under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiling sun, and along trails dotted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">human skulls daring men ventured, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flood usually in the lead; bands of swash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckling revolutionists attacked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed the enemy, fighting valiantly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sapping their way through intervening</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Through mad stampedes in the far North</seg><seg type="columnLine">we surged, flogging the lagging huskies with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the singing whips. Sheath knives gleamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">greasily in the murky light cast by swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">forecastle lamps as with a table leg we</seg><seg type="columnLine">met the onrush of pockmarked Portuguese</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors. We shivered and munched gum</seg><seg type="columnLine">drops and ate dried pemmican at the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">poles of the earth. The ice groaned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">upheaved beneath us, and outside our</seg><seg type="columnLine">igloos of snow the wolf dogs howled mourn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Flood painted with a lavish brush. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">colder than the arctic or 'antarctic wastes</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat Nig Barberly at the other end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch, swarthy faced, silent and sneering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the conclusion of one of Flood's nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratives he took his feet down from the rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, cleared his throat, spat through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screening and turned his chair half around</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our direction. He expelled the air from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lungs in a contemptuous grunt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Flood reared up and looked across at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few seconds like an angry lion. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began telling about beating up a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual in Salina Cruz. He took great</seg><seg type="columnLine">pains on the personal description of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual, painting him as a tall, lanky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Medicine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">137</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man, black-mustached, silent to surliness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">underhanded, mean, low-down, and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous in the cunning way of a snake in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog days. His description fitted Barberly</seg><seg type="columnLine">so well that most of us were dividing our</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention between the story and watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">how Nig would take it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flood elaborated. He had just ended a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentence about said party in question being</seg><seg type="columnLine">so "honery" that he would "beat up his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">granny" and "take up sprouted corn" when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we noticed Barberly's face contort into lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of horrible ferocity. His white teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed through his snarling lips. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">volley of oaths roared from his lungs as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed Flood for every liar and so-and-so</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> big Medicine sprang three feet in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went for him all spraddled out, whoop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like an Indian. Barberly whipped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">two .45 Colts and began shooting from both</seg><seg type="columnLine">hips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alabam Goodloe always denied being</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first to jump through the screen, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was torn off the entire end of the porch</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the swarming crowd. Some ran up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road toward the eating-house and some ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the road toward New Gatun and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran around and watched proceedings, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">morbid curiosity to see bloodshed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughter getting the better of their judg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was one of these latter and when I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the road Flood was writhing on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door in horrible fashion and groaning like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken bull. He struggled to his knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from the recesses of his shirt and pants</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew forth a sawed-off shotgun with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock whittled into a pistol handle--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most ghastly shooting-iron that any man</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever laid eyes on. When both barrels</seg><seg type="columnLine">went off it sounded like the premature blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Culebra Cut the time Teddy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was nearing the hospital on the hill be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween there and New Gatun when 1 heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">live feeble little shots like a pop-gun from</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in that direction, but I didn't turn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look back. I was on my way for the ambu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lance and in my heartfelt desire to get help</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as possible had forgotten that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a phone in the hook and ladder house a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few doors above House 68. Had I remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered, it is doubtful whether I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to use the phone, for the girls were</seg><seg type="columnLine">very popular and connections hard to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the men had left off work on the job.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A FEW evenings later, when Flood</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrated the incident to an unusu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally large bunch on the porch, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave what I hadn't seen as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me and Nig both fell sprawlin' and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few that hadn't yet joined the bird gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed signs of speed and tore up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground getting away.

Two mangy camels, sulky even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sleep, lay with their heads stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. on snaky necks. A dozen pack and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle horses, dwarfed and shaggy, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">dejectedly about at the end of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pickets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the side of his own dog-tent was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">humped canvas where Howard' Remsden</seg><seg type="columnLine">snored on one side of a primitive screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">while, on the other, his stepdaughter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen, slumbered far more gracefully and</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily. Spoked out around the ashes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night's fire sprawled half a dozen Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gols. As McNeill looked keenly at these,</seg><seg type="columnLine">counting them, first one and then another</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhed and twisted in the sleep that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already beginning to be disturbed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun.

His Ups</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted in a smile as he peered closely at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest figure--lifeless, a huddle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes and dirty sheepskin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neat trick that," he told himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Slipped out of his duds.

A brown, long-lingered hand clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">a disc of polished silver lilted so as lo catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun-rays flaring off at premeditated in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tervals, a long or short glare of intense light</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the curving hand rocked back and forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the supple, sinewy wrist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One flash caught McNeill fairly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and made them water. He noiselessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted his angle and then inched back, rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">upright, strode past the Mongols and dived</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his dog-tent from which he almost im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately emerged and started to shout at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sleeping men in their own dialect, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigor that soon brought some semblance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerted action from them. A fire was</seg><seg type="columnLine">started and preparations made for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man who had been manipulating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver mirror appeared, yawning as he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the low dunes. He was of the northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">clans, a giant in stature, as tall as McNeill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even broader-shouldered and with arms that</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung his hands close to the knee-caps. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">long knife, unsheathed, flashed red on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thigh. He hailed McNeill with a morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting, and the latter responded with jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shut grimly after the Salutation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the first time I ever saw them mir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror-talk in China," Neill was thinking, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's no reason why they shouldn't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lots of things I haven't seen and never will.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And those priests-?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll start in fifteen minutes.

"The beasts are</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is my affair!" snapped McNeill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am your master in this business and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have your orders.

From Ling's</seg><seg type="columnLine">agate eyes showed a momentary gleam that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been the light of any of a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotions, none of them friendly. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam died before the steady light in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coldly blue orbs of McNeill. Ling turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with the ghost of a shifting grin on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow face. To his shrill syllables two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men shuffled off toward the camels and</seg><seg type="columnLine">three others after the horses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A flap in the humpback tent of native</seg><seg type="columnLine">design was thrown back, and a girl came out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slim in her brown holland riding togs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">putteed, helmeted with a pith topcc, her skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly tanned, her eyes even bluer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill's and her hair yellow as ripe corn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was barely up to McNeill's shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there was no suggestion of delicacy</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her slender figure or the free vigor</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which she walked towards him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose there is no water to spare for</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything but tea," she said. "Not for</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, though I am gritty and grimy to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last degree, but father is fussing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaving."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill ran his fingers over the stiff red</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubble of his own lean jaws and grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a chance of it before nightfall," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered.

"Why do you disobey my or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not possible to obey them, O, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlord," answered Ling, his face deferen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tial, eyelids down, his soft voice impudent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back of him the Mongols had gathered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Dragon's Claw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">141</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a half-ring, looking covertly out of almond</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes that glittered like those of snakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill's left arm shot out, caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist-cloth of Ling and drew the giant to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward him. Ling's right hand shot down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the haft of his knife, but, swifter still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill had drawn his automatic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jabbed its blunt muzzle hard into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach of the Mongol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You dog," he said, "drop that knife!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drop it or-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ling's unwrinkled lids were wide now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In his stare came the red light that shoots</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the black opal and tells of hate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder. But the knife dropped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand and McNeill put his foot upon it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he swiftly searched Ling for more</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons, found another knife and a cheap</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver with three cartridges in the cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. The shells he tossed far away with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerk, flinging the pistol after them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Remsden!" he called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl came running out of the tent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind her followed a stout man with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fussy, important face that was scorched</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than tanned, whose clothes fitted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly and became him worse; a bow-legged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow-stomached person who most evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">essayed to be a personage and who strutted</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a gosling. His pale gray eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined to pop and now they strained at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">action going forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's this McNeill, what's this?" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded in a pompous voice.

And then get</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She got the first and sped back for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second. McNeill stepped back from Ling</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had stood immovable since the drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping of the knife. The muzzle of the rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung in an arc of command about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">semicircle of Mongols.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "First to move, moves once only,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned McNeill. "Now then, Mr. Rems-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den, please go over them carefully and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">move all their weapons.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a coward and he nerved himself up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his task, backed by the girl. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill's directions he tossed the miscel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laneous assortment of weapons into a heap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The latter ordered Ling to make them into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a bundle, using a sheepskin and tying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">package firmly with strips of leather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll carry this," said McNeill, "till we</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the first hole, dirt or water.

Jump!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY jumped and McNeill, rifle at</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry, walked to his own tent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up his field-glasses as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mongols, spurred into feverish activity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped down the canvas. McNeill fo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussed his lenses and looked anxiously to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the western hills.

"We had seen the ritual.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had got all I wanted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't doubt it," said McNeill. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">point is, what did you get?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Remsden blustered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I employed you as guide and interpreter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. McNeill, not to poke into my private</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As things have turned out they are my</seg><seg type="columnLine">private affairs," said McNeill coldly, "if my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life is my private affair, which I think it is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To say nothing of your stepdaughter's life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't know just how highly you value</seg><seg type="columnLine">your own."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off to hasten the final prepara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions for departure.

I'm going to ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rear, Ling, and if I think, or if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should just happen to think, that you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to signal back any change of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans, I'll shoot the lot of you. I'll defile</seg><seg type="columnLine">your bodies and leave them to the vultures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll cut off your queues and burn them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashes. Get my meaning? You do? Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">start!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ling snarled like a trapped wolf, openly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgetting to mask his feelings. McNeill</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned back at liim. The girl rode over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter's side and he changed the grin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smile as he surveyed her fearless eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her trim seat on the pony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are in some danger, Mr. McNeill?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked. He looked at her and frankly</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then some," he added, a bit grimly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thank God I'm not afraid to tell you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But we are going to get out of it all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sure of that," she replied quietly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode ahead to join her stepfather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill's smile came back as he surveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. As the little caravan descended into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shallow ravine with rocks protruding here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there through the sand like dry bones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began to whistle softly. A scrap was for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and McNeill loved a fight. It was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he thought of the girl that the muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his jaws tightened and the whistle was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back in the western hills the dust cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved swiftly down and out into the plain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel points and blades twinkling here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there as the sun pierced the veil of floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE CANON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DOWN in the blackness of the ravine tin</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin thread that still persisted in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watercourse tinkled over the flinty stones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The walls of the canon lifted clear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer five hundred feet, dark blots of purple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The narrow strip of sky above them, as seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the floor of this valley, suddenly ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearing in the sandy desert as if the granite</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipices had thrust themselves up through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yielding soil, was studded with stars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no sound but the sharp voice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waters emerging from the sands to lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves again where the ravine ended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A perilous ledge led along the western cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">and passed the black gorge of a cave that</seg><seg type="columnLine">slanted sharply upwards after a brief passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ran back level for perhaps a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. At the mouth of the cave, rifle across</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knee, sat Neill McNeill, craving for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke he might not permit himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forty-eight hours had passed since they</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the camp where he had caught Ling</seg><seg type="columnLine">heliographing, and all his senses warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that danger was very close at hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew it from the attitude of Ling and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">followers. Their surliness was lightened;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had seen, had heard, or smelled some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that liis over-civilized perceptions had</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed. He knew the priests must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been misled at first but they were indubi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tably far better mounted than the Remsden</seg><seg type="columnLine">party, and not all McNeill's skill had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to obliterate trails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both nights he had bound the Mongols</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and foot. By day he herded them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were utterly one with the pursuit;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were eating up the scant supply of food</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at times tried to delay the march, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill threatened to shoot the first recal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citrant, but, if he left them free, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">but be to augment and advise the enemy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had a plan in mind by which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could still use them, despite their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wishes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both the camels he had killed as too slow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking valuable time to bury them deep so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the clustering carrion birds should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">act as guides. Only two of the horses were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any shape to travel. Remsden had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruined two already with his weight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumsy riding. The detour had delayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and they were still thirty hours from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outskirts of Peking. And, until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Dragon's Claw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">143</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the foreign quarter of that city, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not reckon themselves safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Possibly not then," meditated McNeill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the opposite sky-line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no trail on the face of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff, so he covered the ledge on their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and was on guard against surprize.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the end of the straight tunnel Remsden</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Helen lay resting, if not asleep. Ling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rest were tucked in a niche, none too</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably, and McNeill himself had tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soaked hide-strips that fettered them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder," he went on in thought, "just</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the old boy did back there at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple. He was hobnobbing with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleek rat, Fung-Ti, who got beaten out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-priest at the last Hoang Lung election.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remsden's got his own ambitions. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather be head of the Museum of Philologi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal Research than anything in this world, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next for that matter. He'd barter all</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has for that, his stepdaughter included.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When it comes down to his own ends he's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil of selfishness. A-ha!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He cuddled up his rifle lightly, leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward from the ledge. There was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a hint of moonrise across the ravine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his ears had caught the clink of metal--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hoof on stone, since few horses were shod</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that region, but blade or point against</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirrup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, silhouetted against the radiance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eastern sky, back so far from the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">that only the upper parts of their bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed, there came a file of horsemen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The riders wore queer, pointed caps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowing robes. He could see spears and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns aslant their shoulders. They rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, and he counted over fifty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a slight shuffle beside him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ling, bound as he was, had wriggled his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the front of the cave. His clothes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught on something, and the force he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned to break free had betrayed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as he raised his face and opened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth to shout to the dark riders across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a sidelong sweep McNeill brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the butt of his gun down on the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mongol's skull, and the cry died in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. But it was a close call, and McNeill</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrolled the cave to the niche where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspected his prisoners and gagged them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with dirty strips from their own clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening them with a knife if they made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiniest sound. Then he went back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had left Ling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ledge was empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Came to and rolled himself over," Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neill decided. "Now I wonder just</seg><seg type="columnLine">why."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The answer came to him almost imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately. The riders were coming back</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and McNeill could see two of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismount and peer down into the black gulf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently suspicious of the sound they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard--the slump of Ling into the canon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could have picked them off easily, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remain hidden was of paramount impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance. They had but a small supply of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Besieged in the cave, they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon give in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No other sound came from the fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ling who had sacrificed himself in vain to</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve the fierce priests of Hoang Lung.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The smashing drop of a quarter of a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand feet had beaten the life out of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll stay till morning," McNeill told</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, "and then they'll find him, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went back to the end of the tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the natural rift narrowed and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in a narrow, irregular ramp. Under this</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill paused. Once he wetted his finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and held it up in the darkness. He thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could detect a faint stirring of the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the pocket of the coat he wore, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night air was chill, he fished out an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric torch and slipped the switch. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam fell on the sleeping face of Helen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remsden, as she was styled, having adopted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name of her stepparent. McNeill's</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw hardened as he gazed at the beauty that</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the cruel forcing of the last two days'</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight could not eradicate. From an angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right where the tunnel side-pocketed</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the faint stamping of horses and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reek of their bodies. Then he shifted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray to Remsden's puffy countenance and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooping, shook him by the shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh, what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ssh!" cautioned McNeill. "Come with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to the cave mouth. 1 want a talk with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His tone was imperative and Remsden</seg><seg type="columnLine">yielded to it without further grumbling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By this time the moon had topped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">further wall and was whitening the ledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside. By and by its light would steal</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the depths and, perhaps, reveal</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body of Ling, sure sign that the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were beleaguered near by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill thought of climbing down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">either bringing back the body or hiding it</seg><seg type="columnLine">144</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> beneath loose stones. But, in such dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, he could not hope to eradicate all</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks of the fall from the sharp eyes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would surely be seeking for them as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">light permitted. There would be spatters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood and, in the meantime, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">other things to do--hopes to work on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remsden was one of these latter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">McNEILL tackled his employer</seg><seg type="columnLine">without formality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Remsden, we are in - bad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shape. They've got us cornered. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hoang Lung crowd has just filed along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff across the way. They are suspicious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this place and they'll hang around till</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. There are only two horses fit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you know they are the Hoang</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lung crowd? They may be just a band of</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbers with whom Ling was in league."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll bet you know it is the Hoang Lung</seg><seg type="columnLine">outfit better than I do, Remsden. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of fact, it doesn't matter who they are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so long as they are hostile. If they get us--</seg><seg type="columnLine">well what they do to us two men don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">count so much. I'll take good care they</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't get Miss Helen alive, but they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">nasty devils and their sort of vengeance</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't stop at death. Now I am pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain you've got us in this scrape--</seg><seg type="columnLine">something you've done at the temple. If it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sacrilege we can't help it now. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've stolen something, you and that sleek</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat of a Fung-Ti, perhaps they'll make</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms with us if you give it up. And it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to you to do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Remsden's beefy face was rigid with</seg><seg type="columnLine">obstinacy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've done nothing that can be undone,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill, keeping the ray shaded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">without, suddenly threw the light on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remsden's face and surveyed him keenly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pop-eyes showed only a sullen dogged-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was all right for you to risk your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">life for whatever you were after," went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill, "but, though you told me and told</seg><seg type="columnLine">your stepdaughter you only wanted to wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness the ritual, I don't believe you. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now you are risking her life and mine for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that matter. You've fooled both of us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's two lives against yours and both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them younger ones.

There must be some way</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of this. It isn't just a question of</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, McNeill. I told you I'd give you</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bonus if the trip was satisfactory. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">double that. I'll triple it if you get me</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe into Peking. That was in the contract</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to guard as well as guide. Get me safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Peking, McNeill, and I'll give you a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars. I'll give you five."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "1 wouldn't accept five cents for trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save your skin," said McNeill.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl was still sleeping. He switched his ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the rift above his head and clambered</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the slanting way. It was some four</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet wide and the sides were damp with</seg><seg type="columnLine">moisture. It narrowed, but he wormed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way on and then backed down again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It goes through," he said to himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And it's all soft earth, I'm fairly certain--</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a landslide.

They labored in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark, save for occasional spurts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch, but they made good progress.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remsden watched without speaking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill who had no time to spare for him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the girl awoke and came feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Dragon's Claw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">145</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">through the dusk of the cave to see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was happening. McNeill spared a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so to tell her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll locate us by morning," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But they won't lind us. I was sure I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted a current of air passing down this</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft that has filled up in some landslide</seg><seg type="columnLine">during winter rains. It is not at all prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able they know of its existence. Once we</seg><seg type="columnLine">break through we can get the ponies up</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and make a clean getaway while they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are trying to rush the ledge or fooling about</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bottom of the ravine. We can hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">them off from the cave-front indefinitely."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"As long as we have water," she corrected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's moisture enough in that shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep us going for a while," answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill. "But I'll make shift to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">them our Chinese friends we have with us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as long as they think they have us</seg><seg type="columnLine">trapped, they'll go leisurely about it. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meantime you and Mr. Remsden will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be streaking for Peking."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you, what are you going to do?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Me? I'm going to amuse myself giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lesson in marksmanship to the Hoang</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lung crowd until I've made them very shy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of doing anything else but try and starve us</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. You see they won't figure we have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">back door and not use it. Then, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've got them cautious, I'll come scooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotfoot after you two. There's the Piu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kiang River ten miles east-by-north, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are little villages here and there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You must buy a boat or steal one and take</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the stream.

Those coolies are</seg><seg type="columnLine">slacking up I think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill went after the Mongols, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl subsided. He did not dare to leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">workmen though he dreaded letting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of Ling remain in plain sight in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravine. Not that it much mattered, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, if they got through the tunnel all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. His own chance of getting away on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yellow pony was pretty slim, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty, as he saw it, was to see to the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances of the girl and of the man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">indubitably employed him as guard as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as guide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The current of air was steadily stronger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now and then he climbed Up among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, blinding them with his light, ignoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the murder in their faces, making them turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">their backs while he inspected, whipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with his will and the fear of death</seg><seg type="columnLine">lest they strangle him in a sudden rush.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would not do to let them get too close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ultimate opening. That he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear himself, or they would give the alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, after hours of incredible toil, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was done. It was close to dawn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon had gone, with the stars paling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when McNeill broke through to the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found a fortunate masking of bushes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scrub trees all about the hole. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">again he herded the bound Mongols to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">niche and then, with Remsden struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with blistering hands to help him, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men enlarged the mouth of the shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it was wide enough to allow the egress</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dwarf ponies. All this time the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on watch where the horizontal tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened on the ledge, above the crushed body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ling, while the mists began to wisp out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ravine and the sunrise was imminent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">McNEILL got the two horses up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incline and saddled them, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remsden gathered such provisions</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they would need. Then McNeill fetched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed out to them the lay of the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sloped toward the little river that, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its turn, would bring them out on the water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">highway to Peking. He gave them brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructions as to their course, handing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the maps and two rifles with ammuni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Remsden could use enough Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">dialect to make his offers of money under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood and, as long as they kept ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fanatic priests and their influence, Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neill had little doubt that they could buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">146</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their safety to Peking. At the last mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, when McNeill had crawled off to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff edge on a reconnoitering expedition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl rebelled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall not go without McNeill," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared.

Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">off with you; I have got to get back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw the rebellion in Helen's eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "/1m revoir, Miss Remsden," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let me help you mount. I assure you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I am in no more danger in remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you in going--probably less. On my</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of honor!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked deep into his eyes and slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">blushed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you do not arrive when you say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a few hours of us," she said, so low</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Remsden, for all his straining ears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not catch the words, "I shall come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back after you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill saw them disappear into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gully, his hat off to the girl, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastened down again to the tunnel. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked out one of the Mongols and pricked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him ahead with his knife-blade until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter showed himself reluctantly at the cave</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately there was a flash from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite cliff, the singing of a bullet, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spang of its lead on the rocky lintel of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave and the echoing report. The China-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man shrank back, and McNeill laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They meant that for me, Ba-ti," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Presently I'll return the compliment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had no intention of firing where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not sure of a target. Every moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained helped Remsden and the girl and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he did fire, he wanted to put the fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his marksmanship into the priests. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought they had him earthed. A good</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot or so would make them cautious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tightened up the foot-ropes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mongol and put him back with the rest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he made a little barricade of loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones and sat down to guard the ledge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not dare expose himself to harass</seg><seg type="columnLine">those in the ravine but he hoped that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would attempt to rush the narrow path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hours passed and then a fusillade of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets smashed about the cave mouth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzzed down the tunnel. The comers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill's mouth turned up into a little grin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He squinted down the ledge, lying flat in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">conduit he had made of the rocks, thrusting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rifle through a niche.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he expected, a rush was on. A cluster</seg><seg type="columnLine">of racing figures turned a shoulder of rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and McNeill began firing rapidly, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite aim. Two figures leaped up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged into the gulf; another sprawled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ledge; a fourth dragged back around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buttress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will keep them thinking for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while," McNeill told himself. "I wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">how about the other direction?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned over and, even as he turned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the soft pad of swiftly running feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The priests of Hoang Lung had split and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had meant to attack simultaneously. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">inequalities of the path had hindered their</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect junction, and once again McNeill's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle took heavy toll. Two men, shot almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">simultaneously, whirled, clutched at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other and went spinning down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That'll teach 'em not to be in too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a hurry," muttered McNeill as he slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Dragon's Claw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">147</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh cartridges into the chamber while</seg><seg type="columnLine">stray bullets still sung and splashed above</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "I don't believe they've got more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a couple of rifles at that," he told him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. "Now for the next move. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe they'll try another rush--try and</seg><seg type="columnLine">starve us out. I don't fancy they are wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rying much about those Chinks I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">corraled. Neither am I. I wonder how</seg><seg type="columnLine">many miles are left in that yellow cayuse."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His half-formed plan crystallized as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back into the tunnel and flashed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch over the bunch of bound Mongols.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One man he selected as close to his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">build, though lacking in height. This man</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shuffled back to where the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses were stalled and, at the muzzle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his automatic, ordered him to strip. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man demurred, and McNeill clipped him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the jaw with his pistol, putting him out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he deftly peeled off the dirty, unsavory</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes and reluctantly put these on over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own underwear, after investing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinaman with the outer garb of Neill</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The battery of his torch was dimming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast as he had worked, and it flickered en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely out before he had finished. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got the limping pony to the top of the shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Chinaman with it. He had col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected the few things he meant to take with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him^and now, with the wondering, hating</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of the Mongol watching him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled through the bushes for a last survey</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the enemy, crawled back and, with almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last of his water supply, unflinchingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraped off with a dull blade all the sprout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing red growth on his jaws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he surveyed the lay of the land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To one side, where, almost three hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, Remsden and his daughter had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the river, the fissures offered him ample</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover. To the other the land opened to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat plateau sparsely set with dwarf growths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill forced the Mongol to mount the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tethered yellow pony that was in no way</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to move, tied his feet under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal's belly and his wrists to the saddle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">horn. Once again he slid through the bushes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fired a random shot across the canon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The echoes crashed as answering bullets</seg><seg type="columnLine">came wildly back. He cut the tether,</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed the pony for the plateau, pricked it</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply on the flank and fired a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots beneath it that sent it flying fearfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the scrub bearing a figure in Euro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pean costume on its back, crouching to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid the missiles that sped toward it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">long range, and then McNeill dived swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the nearest depression and, making the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of his start, fled for the Chang-Li</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At nightfall McNeill squatted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of a hut. Outside its door the Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gabbling the local gossip. The boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Duk Sing had been stolen. Sing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it gone when he started for the eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning fishing. The boat had vanished, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold piece was lying by the tether picket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped in a scrap of cloth. So Sing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky, for the boat was old. And Chee Foy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found two ponies with their saddles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been a great day, said Wong Lee, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headman. It was good to talk but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be going, for the tide was right and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were waiting for his cargo in Peking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He envied Sing his luck; money was scarce.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Wong Lee started to go aboard his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargo-boat where the polers only awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">his coming, a figure came out of the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked in the dialect of the district for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not free, oh Wong Lee," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleader as the headman scowled. "For, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the favor of my aunt, I have some small</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of money with me, and the trip is ur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent. I am sick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a lire burning on an iron plate</seg><seg type="columnLine">amidships of the long craft with its thatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin and high prow. By the uncertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">light Wong Lee looked doubtfully at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger. The man's head was bound up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">filthy cloths that concealed all but a strip</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing nose and cheek-bones. The brow</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandage came so low as to hide the eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is thy sickness?" asked Wong Lee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And where is thy money?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not catching. Lo, I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffering long from decayed teeth and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night air brings on the pain, so I journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Peking to seek a doctor. Here is half of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I possess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of the waistcloth in which his auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic was tucked away handily, McNeill</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced some copper cash and two small</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of gold. He held these out on a palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackened with dirt. Wong Lee swept all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it into his own paw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get aboard," he said magnanimously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I will send thee to a cousin of mine who is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mighty doctor in Peking.

Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one ran down toward the river-landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging a flare and shouted, but Wong</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lee, with an oath, took no notice and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft shot swiftly down the broad stream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None but the boatmen had seen McNeill</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that at the last moment. If the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrivals were the priests of the Hoang-Lung</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had no reason to suspect the entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular departure of Wong Lee. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a bend in the stream and the shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lights died out, and McNeill cuddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on some mats in the cabin, groaning a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little from time to Lime about the decayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth that he was forced to protect against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER HI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FEATURES OF FUNG-TI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER nine years of wanderings in in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior China, prospecting, engineering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventuring, Neill McNeill, with his knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of customs and dialects, was compara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively at home in Peking. He changed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">filthy rags for Occidental raiment at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nalive lailor's who was lo him more of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend than a mere tradesman and, Lhus</seg><seg type="columnLine">rehabiliLated, hurried to the Imperial Hotel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the trip of the cargo-boat he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found no trouble in picking up the trail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eccentric American and his daughler.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remsden, wilh a smallering of Chinese, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no fool and, once free from immediale pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suil, he had got together an escort and</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled with speed and comfort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill's connection with him would</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon be over, the latter thoughl regrel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully.

Better,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew when not to do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill stood apart in talk with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearded man who had built many miles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad in interior China only to see his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work undone by fanatic hordes, urged on by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the priests. Neill's field-glasses were slung</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his sides, and he unbuckled the case and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took them out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The moon'll be up in a few minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilson," he said. "It's lightening over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastern ridge now. Canfield and I are going</seg><seg type="columnLine">in alone on foot as soon as it rises. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">we've fixed things at the first arch we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp in one of the caves.

"Wouldn't at least a display</seg><seg type="columnLine">of force help out? Of course you're run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning this show."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've gone over it very carefully," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill.

There are parallel ridges leading in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that general direction and Canfield and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will keep the valleys, though I don't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is much fear of a lookout. They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">expecting us, no doubt, but it is our move</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they are not likely to be worrying about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. We are three days t'o the good.

The arches, particularly the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, were plain to see, their stones silvered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the moon, now clear of the ridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'S up to you," said Wilson at last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"till eight o'clock tomorrow.

He had laid plans accordingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Canfield came forward to meet them, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngest of the troop, a man absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckless, once given his head, but possessing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rare quality of being able to take orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a man he acknowledged capable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ready to go, McNeill?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Righto," returned Canfield, Britisher</seg><seg type="columnLine">and younger son.

There they compared</seg><seg type="columnLine">watches carefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll check again in the morning, Can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field," said McNeill. "I want to pull this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing off to the second, if possible. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">three o'clock now. These priests are a lazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd.

There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sound of gong, no sign of life within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure. The gates were shut, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the frowsy sentinel slept inside. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">holy priests of Hoang Lung were not ascet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ics. So far as they could obtain it, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived upon the fat of the land and denied</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves nothing, and, by virtue of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">claw, their tribute was universal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">munificent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At fifteen minutes after seven McNeill</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a whistle from his pocket and blew on</seg><seg type="columnLine">it shrilly. A wicket in the upper leaf of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate was drawn back, and the sleepy eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a watchman peered out, widened as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the solitary white devil, and suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was fifteen minutes more before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gates were opened and a group of yellow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">robed and shaven priests appeared, escorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a score of so-called soldiery, armed with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nondescript array of swords, wide-bladed</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears, muskets and rifles of all vintages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In their midst McNeill walked through to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner courtyard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A short, fat priest advanced. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient. His avoirdupois spoke eloquently</seg><seg type="columnLine">of self-indulgence, and his face, projecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the draped hood that puffed about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">full neck, held no more expression than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a turtle. The small eyes showed merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, no more emotion than if they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">insets of jet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tao Chan?" asked McNeill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This had been the name of the writer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the letter to Remsden, the name of the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest of Hoang Lung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tao Chan acknowledged the dignity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have brought back the claw?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is the hostage safe?" parried McNeill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"To talk in questions is to waste time,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied the priest. "First answer me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I can make delivery of the claw."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The girl is unharmed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then show her to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Show me the claw."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill laughed, and a red light came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the jetty eyes of Tao Chan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not wise to make a mock of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guardian of the claw," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not wise to take a white man for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool, O guardian that has no claw to guard,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered McNeill. "Show me the girl!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There had been no apparent sign, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">priests fell back and the guards edged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Irishman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Touch me and I destroy your temple,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said confidently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Tao Chan's turn to laugh, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grin was the nearest he could come to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You speak boldly," he sneered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill was gaging his time, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">covertly at the hands of his wrist-watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The bargain was to exchange the girl for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the claw," he said. "You know I must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to produce the claw or I would not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">have traveled so far. I must know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can produce the girl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tao Chan's immutable face gave no sign,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and McNeill's heart sank, then rose again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If they had injured her? To them the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a white maiden, save as they could use it</seg><seg type="columnLine">for torture, was nothing. He tried a lead on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Also there are many thousands of white</seg><seg type="columnLine">maidens, O Tao Chan, and but one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">claw."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is but one maiden for thee, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And yet there are thousands, aye mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions, who hold thee responsible for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">claw," challenged McNeill. "If I return</seg><seg type="columnLine">not with the girl in safety, all China will</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how. Tao Chan has been outwitted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foreign devils, and I do not think what</seg><seg type="columnLine">is left of thy life will be happy. Show me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Still no visible sign, but the guards inched</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. It seemed clear to McNeill that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole thing had been planned before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate was opened. They meant to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">claw and wreak their vengeance on McNeill</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the girl, if she was not already sacrificed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked at his watch. It was five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes of the hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have warned you," he said. "Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I was fool enough to come here alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the claw upon me? There are yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">three days within which to deliver it. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not far from here but in a place where you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can never find it. First I must know</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether you can keep your side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bargain. Show me the girl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think you can be made to tell where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">claw is," said Tao Chan softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not know where it is," said McNeill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So I can not tell you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">154</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke with such utter conviction that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tao Chan's face twitched. He believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the foreign devil might be telling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth. He gave an order. It was repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to where guards lounged on the steps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quaintly-roofed temple. The lacquered</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors opened, and the figure of Helen Rems-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den appeared between two priests, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped back a little from her. She gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little cry, and McNeill, whimsically conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the incongruity of the action, took off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet Then the doors closed again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We shall not torture you the first," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tao Chan very quietly. "First you shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch us work with the girl. After that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you may not care to live. But we shall give</seg><seg type="columnLine">you certain chances from time to time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring in the claw. You foreign devil," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued almost in a monotone that</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened the more with its repression,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"did you think you could ravish the shrine</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dragon god and go unscathed?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fung-Ti has been punished. So shall all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of you be punished. Your prayers</seg><seg type="columnLine">for pity shall lack lips to utter them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Touch me," said McNeill, "and I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot you through the belly, Tao Chan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just one tiny touch--I have you covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">now from my pocket--and you will be ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaining to your gods why you could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep their claw. I give you one chance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tell your men to fall back, bring out th**</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl in a palanquin borne by four priests.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You and four more shall accompany me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot where the claw will be turned over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you. Will you do this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the last few seconds marked by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">march of the hands on McNeill's watch, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men, Occidetal and Oriental, held a</seg><seg type="columnLine">duel of glances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">K'^^IN THE fissure Canfield stooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">f â¢p""above a little instrument of polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">rj^kli^wood and brass. For fifteen min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes he had been expecting to hear Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neill's whistle. Now he knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little lesson they had arranged was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">given, and he glanced at his own watch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked over his adjustments with nerveless</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No," bluffed the high-priest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back of them there was a muffled roar, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift suggestion of exploding gases, a cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke that mushroomed, in which frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of masonry lofted and rushed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">again while the outer arch crumbled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolved before the eyes of Hoang Lung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill had not moved a muscle. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he put the question again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you do this? Or shall I destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shrine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tao Chan thought rapidly. He guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat of the means employed to level</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arch. But it had been done very</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleverly, and he could not offset the terror of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ignorant underlings by a talk on dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mite. To them it was all magic. McNeill</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed very confident, and Tao Chan felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the white man might use more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this magic wisdom to carry out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat. True, the girl was in lie Temple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at his panic-stricken guards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the uneasiness of his priests, trained as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were to avoid emotion, and he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at McNeill, jaunty, nonchalant, all save his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, which were bits of steel. The white</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil might sacrifice the girl. They did</seg><seg type="columnLine">such things when they were desperate, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save them from torture. The claw must</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back. He metaphorically tossed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cards. He was still qualmish in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach that McNeill had threatened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more he gave an order, whereupon</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill whipped out his whistle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded it twice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Canfield picked up his battery and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nections and strolled out of his cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Worked like a charm," he said to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lizards that flickered before him. "A little</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of all right, that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A BAFFLED mob clustered about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ruins of the outer arch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullenly watched the palanquin borne</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the priests depart under the command of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two white devils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill and Canfield walked one on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the chair and talked through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn curtains of elaborately embroidered</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk to the rescued Helen Remsden. McNeill</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Helen did most of the talking, Canfield</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed, and, being a goods sport, he filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the time smoking cigarets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So they came to the camp in the hills,</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling the crest of the ridge, despite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, for McNeill wanted to make sure they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not followed.

Mr. Remsden said</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to the contrary. But, when I left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel, I fancied a Chinaman who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">loafing about the compound noticed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly and when I was in the Bazaar</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was almost certain that this same man</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in and spoke to one of the clerks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This clerk spoke to the man serving me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I fancy I showed some suspicion, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprize, and it only shows how clever they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, for the man who was waiting on me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the principals of the Bazaar, I fancy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who talked beautiful English, asked me al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most instantly if I knew the man.

He rated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man, who slunk out. I knew, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that such a thing was very likely to happen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that almost every tourist purchase has</seg><seg type="columnLine">a squeeze or two behind the price.

The diminutive pony was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being pushed to its top speed by a China-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who swayed in his saddle from weari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. When they came up to him, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not avoid them in the rocky pass, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw he was an old man, far too ancient to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be attempting such a ride without escort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rode his pony to one side along the slant</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the piled-up talus of the ravine, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the party half curiously, half furtively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sight of the girl on the horse seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinate him. Then McNeill, who, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilson, had been playing rear-guard from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a possible pursuit and suqjrize, came gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loping up and the Chinaman shrank on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle to a mere bundle of clothes, hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mummy face by pulling down the folds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the turban-like head-gear he wore against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But McNeill had recognized him, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not seek to detain him.

In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinaman's face was the same mixture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied greed and furtive alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He'll be a bit late with his news,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought McNeill and dismissed him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next nightfall they rode through the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirts of Peking, the cavalcade gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking up as they reached the foreign</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter, only Wilson and Canfield riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">with McNeill and the girl through the arch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of the hotel courtyard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill dismounted, went in and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with the news.

Being free from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hoang Lung pursuit, as he evidently be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved, Remsden had every intention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelving every one connected with it, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluding McNeill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He developed a slight illness that McNeill</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewdly suspected was assumed and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage of it to keep his stepdaughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">in close attendance upon him, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young millionaire as a willing aide. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">Honolulu he took the enamored youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Helen for a long ride during the wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the steamer, and McNeill whistled for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance alone with the girl. Moreover</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words of Remsden bore some weight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill had no right to court the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless his future was assured instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely being rosy-hued, as at present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so, in the rare moments when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the girl alone, he did not tell her, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had hinted at Peking, how she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">repay him for bringing her safely out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger. He was the last man to bid for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a girl's love because he had done what</seg><seg type="columnLine">any red-blooded man would do for a girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">in peril. Mutual desire was the only thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on which to base happiness, he decided.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he could avow his love, backed by worldly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth to attend to all her comforts, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she showed him his love might not be un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acceptable, then he would put the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the test.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile he must attend to his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs in San Francisco while they went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York by the first train, leaving four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours after the Cathay docked.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapid heir was going on the same train,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed, and buzzing about Helen like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hungry bee at sunset.

He had even</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned, more carefully, Helen.

His host's hearty man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, evident interest and keen appreciation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his doings and their financial possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bilities soon put McNeill altogether at</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease with the world. Only one untoward</seg><seg type="columnLine">incident occurred to disturb two hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfactory business talk and establish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of social relations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cox ordered refreshments. The butler</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a Chinaman. Cox's menage was largely</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese, he explained, and eminently satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">factory. As a butler the man was perfect--</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent, careful, deferential. Not once did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seem to glance from beneath his smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">crescent lids at master or guest while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did his serving; but, as he left the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill caught one oblique glance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">those sloe-black eyes directed at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the reflection of a mirror. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes seemed to appraise, to check up, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">menace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill knew what strange tricks imagi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation plays when one allows any subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">of peculiar interest to one's mental or</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical welfare to once become dominant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still he was glad to find the fog had lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his car was ordered and he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the quiet Californian night. Cox</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed him hard to stay until the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, when they would motor down</seg><seg type="columnLine">together and complete the negotiations</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would set McNeill free to go to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York--and Helen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, with the absence of the fog, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of danger seemed lessened. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, if any was brewing, McNeill wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see it through. It was late and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver started back at a good pace for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. In less than half a mile, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine began to stall and he got out</seg><seg type="columnLine">for investigation. They were on the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">road of the fairly populous suburb. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side were Summer villas standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in considerable, well-tended grounds, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind walls or hedges, as the owners' fancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">chose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chauffeur tinkered and overhauled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at last investigated the gasoline tank</seg><seg type="columnLine">in default of better explanation of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. He gave a sharp exclamation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Empty!" he said. "I told them to fill</seg><seg type="columnLine">it up at the garage. We ought to have six</seg><seg type="columnLine">or seven gallons and there ain't a drop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you see it filled?" asked McNeill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I didn't.

'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man started down the road and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him turn into the gates of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">villa. There were a few lights in the nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses and the sound of music came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them. It was all very quiet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaceful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HTHEN, with a rush, they were on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Two figures hurled themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the low wall to his right; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the swift patter of footsteps from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind as he stood at the rear of the car.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instinctively he backed up to it and felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his pistol. The gun was gone. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese butler had helped him on with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his light coat and deftly lifted it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two assailants were coming for him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">head on. Even in the uncertain light he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt sure they carried no weapons. Swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reached out his long, sinewy arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupped a head in. either palm and brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">them together with a thud that dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two senseless in the dust of the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then something flickered about his neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">from behind. He knew what it was as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightened. Some one had climbed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tonneau and deftly slipped a bowstring</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his neck. The cord tightened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank into the flesh, beyond his power to</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosen. A red glare came before him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt consciousness slipping away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then sudden relief, though he sagged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground even as he sucked the air into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tortured lungs. The glaring headlights</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a machine dazzled him as the oncoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">car jarred to a standstill a few feet away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and two men jumped out and came toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's up, old chap?" asked one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers, giving him a hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill saw that the two whose heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had cracked had disappeared. So had</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtless his other opponent. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ibo</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">close shave. Only for these two night birds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had obviously been celebrating, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been all off with Neill McNeill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We ran out of gas," he said, with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty, for the cord had bitten deeply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My man went back to the house there for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply and I had a touch of vertigo. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't been very well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vertigo? That's a new name for it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old pal," said the second man. "I'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spring that on my wife. We thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw a couple of chaps duck out, right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left, as we came along and then we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">you fall. Maybe we had vertigo our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill summoned a laugh. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not inclined to give his confidence now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was well out of it. His driver was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming back with the gasoline in a can.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm all right now, anyway," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thanks, both of you.

He was already wondering how soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could call upon the Remsdens--upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen Remsden, to be exact. It was mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning and he would have to wait until</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon he decided.

Presently he pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the paper and gradually became more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more interested. On an inner page</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a half-tone engraving of two men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most modem of conventional attire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk-hatted yet prominently foreign, Ori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ental.

After making his speech of acceptance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Remsden formally presented the museum</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a curio that is without parallel--a relic dating</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the myths of ancient China, no less an</seg><seg type="columnLine">object than the long worshipped claw of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">legendary dragon gods of the Flowery Kingdom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This morning Mr. Remsden is to deliver an</seg><seg type="columnLine">address on this unique possession to the members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the museum and other invited savants.

While Prince Liu Chi, when inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed last night at his hotel, laughingly deprecated</seg><seg type="columnLine">any belief that the claw actually belonged to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mythical demigod, he professed intense interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in viewing it and listening to Mr. Remsden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Modem China looks at such things as a modem</seg><seg type="columnLine">American might the relics of some Indian cairn,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Prince Ten Shin in corroboration of his cousin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude. "It is fitting that the most progressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nations should hold such an antiquity. I under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand there are certain characters carven upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jade holder that may be of value to twentieth</seg><seg type="columnLine">century research, from our standpoint. We shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly accept the invitation of the museum</seg><seg type="columnLine">authorities."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both princes speak English fluently and seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely at home with our customs, which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have largely adopted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was a staggering thing and McNeill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanically folding up the paper, emitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">so sharp a whistle that the passers-by</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at him curiously. But he paid no</seg><seg type="columnLine">heed to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How could Remsden have presented the</seg><seg type="columnLine">claw to the museum when, he, McNeill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given it over to Tao Chan as ransom</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the girl? Some jugglery had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">on here--jugglery that increased the danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Remsden and his stepdaughter to tlie</seg><seg type="columnLine">wth degree. The visit of the two princes</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be merely a coincidence. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberalism was palpably a blind and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">real mission revealed. They were after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">claw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Yet the claw was with Tao Chan. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be possible that Remsden had</seg><seg type="columnLine">regained it. He had literally fled from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peking. It was almost absurd to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was another relic like it. McNeill</seg><seg type="columnLine">was positive there was not. Even if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, the possession of it--the gift of it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the museum would be as deadly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The interview did not ring true to</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill. It might have been reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">correctly, but what did an American news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paperman know of the subtleties of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Oriental mind? No matter what story</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remsden might have coined as to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtaining possession of the relic, to exhibit</seg><seg type="columnLine">such an object of reverence to the princes</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be, in their eyes, little short of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">insult--a sacrilege. They must surely know</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about what had happened at the temple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Americans might think little of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese museum having on show specimens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of early American culture or crudeness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the claw had been imbedded for unrecorded</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries in the heart of all that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese. It was interwoven with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very essence of ancestor worship. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">holy. No American who had not lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">years in China could ever hope to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">differences of thought in such an affair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The racial ideas of the two nations were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of years apart. Even Remsden</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not properly sense what McNeill felt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the claw was in the museum and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remsden, in his blind pomposity, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevated to the pinnacle he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to spend so much--to risk so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to obtain. But, in the eyes of the princes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all their affectation of Occidental ideas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remsden was a profaner of shrines, a robber</seg><seg type="columnLine">of China's holy of holies. McNeill had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to admit that the museum must have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">claw, though how this had happened was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a riddle hard to solve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What would be the next move? pon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered McNeill. An attempt to get hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the claw, or swift and horrible revenge</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Helen, her stepfather and, perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, if they knew of his presence in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill strove to unravel what might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in the minds of the two princes and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he started north for the Remsdens. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was vital that he should find out just what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had occurred--what Remsden had done--</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the claw came from. He wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether Helen had been present at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reception. The early evening editions came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, but there was nothing more in them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Wall Street magnate had collapsed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the market was in jeopardy. The Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">princes were eclipsed, Remsden forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE East Nineties reached and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house located, McNeill sent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his card by a serving man who ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vated his eyebrows the slightest bit as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronounced the name and then, ushering</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill into a reception room, said--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll see if Miss Remsden is at home, sir."</seg><seg type="columnLine">162</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill heard a door shut somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hall. Then he caught faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoes of a voice he recognized as Rems-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den's.

The museum had been broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">into some time between two and three</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock. Only the vigilance of the special</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchmen had prevented serious vandalism.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The intruders were masked. Only a glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been caught of them in the Oriental</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallery where the claw of the dragon king,</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented by the newly elected president,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was deposited. A protective agency man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt-shod, had seen the marauders bending</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the case in which the claw had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed. He shouted and fired as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burglars rushed for an open window from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the netting had been removed. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">other watchmen had rushed to his assist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance and a general alarm was turned in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blood was found on the windowsill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing that the bullet of the watchman</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been well aimed.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was said that a swift car had been seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking the speed limits in the vicinity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the museum. The police believed they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had an important clew.

The man seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have shrunk like a balloon from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough gas has escaped to make the outline</seg><seg type="columnLine">flabby. His florid complexion was blotched</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were sagging pouches under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, which themselves held a constant</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeal. Something had evidently fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened Remsden badly and he clung to</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill's hand as would a despairing</seg><seg type="columnLine">swimmer to the rescuer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill was not particularly sorry for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and he did not pretend to be.

Moreover, whatever peril</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced him included her.

I saw the claw turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to the priest and I returned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen--with Miss Remsden. Now, in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, I read that you have presented the</seg><seg type="columnLine">claw to the museum and now, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second time,' you tell me that she is in</seg><seg type="columnLine">jeopardy on account of it, and on account</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your own infernal ambition," he added</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Remsden, you concealed from me</seg><seg type="columnLine">your first depredations from the temple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't hide anything from me this time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I warn you that if your stepdaughter's fife</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangs by a thread, as I believe it does,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours is still closer to annihilation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw in the dilated eyes of Remsden</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he, too, realized this. It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror for liis stepdaughter as much as for</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself that had shaken him.

I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay him an enormous sum to overcome his</seg><seg type="columnLine">superstitions--almost as much as I paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fung-Ti in the first place--but he did it</seg><seg type="columnLine">He brought the two to me at the Im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perial-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw the man," said McNeill shortly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I thought you had referred it to him for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion.

He would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrifice his own presidency, so long coveted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In all probability it had been obtained by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his promise of the relic to the museum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Such arrangements were not uncommon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To take back the claw would mean his</seg><seg type="columnLine">resignation, an awkward explanation, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps making him the laughing stock of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific world.

But you'll let me know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">you come out with the princes, won't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neill reflected.

I had to change the talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had prepared in some measure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Remsden got fiery red under McNeill's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewd look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it went off well enough until it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meeting the princes. I say well enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I had felt all through my speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were laughing at me--you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I mean, McNeill, those ivory faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless, the smooth lids that don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">open like a white man's, they just slit apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you see their black eyes laughing at you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like mocking devils. And, when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook hands, it was like touching the skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a snake!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Hands across the sea,' that's what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liu Chi said, 'we are not so far apart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Remsden, after all.'

Nothing of the hatchetman method</seg><seg type="columnLine">about those two slick yellow devils, Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neill. And they smiled when they handled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the claw. I had a wild idea that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might try to claim it. I would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made the presentation if I had known</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their presence in the country, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">just smiled with their eyes and gave it back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Forsythe, our curator, who was watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as he does every one, even me, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyes of a hawk. The gift belongs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the museum and he is responsible. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one is a possible thief in his eyes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose," commented McNeill, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all ancient curios may be styled stolen</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods.

That would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have eased matters. But it would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">some powerful influence to make Tao Chan</seg><seg type="columnLine">let even the copy go.

Neill had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismissed his taxi and now he swung into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the park. His shadow persisted and Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neill led him on at a smart pace, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">a corner abruptly and hiding behind some</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrubbery. He saw the man go by and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw also, stamped on his skull-like face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evidence of opium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall have an interesting interview</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our Oriental potentates, I fancy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told himself as he caught a bus to return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his hotel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His room was made up. Pinned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillow-sham was a gold dragon, six-clawed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made into a stick pin. McNeill shrugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing small about their methods,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said aloud, then deliberately removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pearl from the scarf and replaced it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the emblem of the dragon-kmg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE HAND OF STEEL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE suites allotted to Princes Liu Chi</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ten Shin were costly according</seg><seg type="columnLine">their capaciousness, running the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of one corridor of the famous New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York hostelry. A private elevator was</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the equipment and to this McNeill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having arranged his appointment, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ushered by the urbane secretary of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">imperial entourage that, despite their</seg><seg type="columnLine">affectation of democracy, still retained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attributes of Chinese aristocracy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanying wealth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A Chines boy was elevator pilot and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">once on the floor of the suite, America</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave place to the Flowery Kingdom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no suggestion of anything</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Occidental, save in the electric fixtures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disguised beneath oiled-silk lanterns, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telephones. Either brought with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or secured from New York Oriental mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chants, the furniture, the rugs, the hangings</seg><seg type="columnLine">--every detail were those of an imperial</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment in the Forbidden City.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The secretary, in American clothes, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in the ante-chamber and pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently a giant Chinaman, whose silken garb</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore the insignia of the royal house, ushered</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill into a room where Liu Chi and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ten Shin, arrayed in magnificent brocades,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose to meet him and bade him be seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a lounge tapestried with sprawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill still wore the dragon pin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed as he was for the morning appoint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and a compact automatic was ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his hand. It would not be hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispose of him, he reflected, if he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the chance. He had come up in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">private elevator. No one would know</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he went down, if he ever did, save a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinaman. His body could be smuggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in some trunk and got rid of quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill was not morbid about this possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility.

"Would it be too much if it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitted to me here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Liu Chi smiled and gave orders in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">language to that effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To what do we owe the pleasure of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit, Mr. McNeill? We have heard that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have visited our country, have, in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived there for several years. That is inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting. You will realize, for one thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difficulty of assimilation that besets</seg><seg type="columnLine">a land like ours in taking up Occidental</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought and ideas, when my countrymen</seg><seg type="columnLine">are so steeped with ignorance and super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stition. But we must do the best we can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The idea of these two imperious beings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bred of a thousand years of despotic</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure, being seriously inclined to sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicity of any sort that bespoke equality,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck McNcill as absurd. It would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">many generations for China to become a</seg><seg type="columnLine">true republic. Liu Chi and Ten Shin</seg><seg type="columnLine">were merely going with the current and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking good care of themselves mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while.

Through it all the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">princes sat like statues, immutable, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes only shown by narrow bars of glitter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing jet between their narrowed lids. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the imperial mandarins sit in justice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the close Ten Shin started to exchange</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few words with his cousin, but McNeill</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupted:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understand the Mandarin dialect,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten Slain and Liu Chi gravely nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">an acknowledgment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is very honorable of you," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter.

The mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seums of England, of France, of all coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tries hold relics of past races. Our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">country has long been overrun by con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">querors; it is the most polyglot of nations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mixed blood, mixed faiths. 'The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">order changeth, yielding place to new,' as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tennyson writes.

It is possible that</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of their members may have attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to threaten Mr. Remsden and play upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fears, but, of a surety, we do not wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">the claw. We were curious to see it, yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there our interest ceases. We came</seg><seg type="columnLine">here for things concerning this generation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and those to come, Mr. McNeill, long</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Mr. Remsden visited the temple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hoang Lung.

They also thought that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lied concerning the innocence of Helen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and himself in the affair, or they did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">care. Ten Shin took up the talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can not pretend to influence such</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our countrymen who may still cling</seg><seg type="columnLine">to superstition," he said.

We are sorry we can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing for you, glad to have listened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. We would suggest that, for Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remsden's peace of mind, he might open</seg><seg type="columnLine">up negotiations for the return or exchange</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the claw, speaking merely as those having</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the workings of the Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">trend of thought.

Not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade of doubt, of surprize, of anger or</seg><seg type="columnLine">pity, not one atom of any emotion had they</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be made to understand her danger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The infinite sarcasm of his reception</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned within him.

Promise</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that you will?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She noted his first free use of her name</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she blushed and then answered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well, Neill, what do you suggest?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WHITE DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next day the princes went to Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington by invitation to see the' sights</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Capital City. Their suite was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">reserved, but McNeill breathed a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more easily. The menace hanging over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen seemed less imminent though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could neither dismiss nor fathom the sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestion of Ten Shin that it had already fal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">len, and it had been an assertion rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a suggestion.

The Irishman's polite covering</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the contempt in which he held Remsden</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have enraged him, but it also forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to at least an equal politeness, as a lion</seg><seg type="columnLine">will go through tricks it hates from fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tamer and his whip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were few allusions to the claw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twice McNeill urged Remsden to do some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing toward the restoration of the claw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to communicate with the princes at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel in Washington, but, confident in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of his little army of protectors, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubbornly refused to discuss the question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a week after the departure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liu Chi and his cousin that Helen made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">complaint that struck fear into the heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of McNeill, ever alert for danger against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl he loved and, who, he had reason to</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe, returned his love.

Their banquet</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been set for the following evening and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all New York, especially that part of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">social center that had not been invited,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was agog over the rumored extravagance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the affair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was to be an Arabian Nights enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainment, it was said. There would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic wrought in more ways than one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all the fabled magnificence of Aladdin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gardens would fade before the spectacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the feast to be spread in the private suite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their imperial highnesses as the society</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns, still secretly delighting in titles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">styled these two Chinamen who claimed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be representatives of a new republic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guests had been asked to attend in Oriental</seg><seg type="columnLine">garb, and all the glamour of a fancy-dress</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair fascinated the fashion-writers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stimulated the curiosity and envy of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">not fortunate enough to receive invitations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Remsden, rather in fear than bravado,</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill thought, had accepted for himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Helen, and Neill himself had likewise</seg><seg type="columnLine">signified his intention of being present.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen and he were discussing costumes</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she presented her finger for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is numb, Neill," she said.

Look at it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As McNeill took the tapering finger a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange fear gripped his heart. The men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the roses seemed to have promoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presentiment. Helen's hand was white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well kept, the texture of a gardenia petal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the tips showed the faint rose-hue</seg><seg type="columnLine">of perfect health. The index finger of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand was the one she complained</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, and McNeill noticed that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">subtly different from the rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could bend it between the first and</seg><seg type="columnLine">second joints but there was no reflex action.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The nail lacked color and the pinkness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tip was entirely missing. The flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unshriveled, but it had a frozen look;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was like a finger carved in alabaster,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a finger of Galatea with all the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful statue come to life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tiny, light-brown speck marked where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sharp thorns of the American beauties</seg><seg type="columnLine">had punctured the skin and drawn blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a smaller mark lower down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in the same way. He strove to hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">his premonition. He dared not gaze into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face, though presently he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to force himself to that inspection, he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long have you noticed this?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Since the morning after the thorns</seg><seg type="columnLine">pricked me," she answered. "I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of it, but it has steadily grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse. I asked Dr. Hastings about it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought there might be some slight local</seg><seg type="columnLine">infection, but it has not swelled; it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply lost all sensation. He didn't seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to consider it very serious. It is my sewing</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger, and I do sew occasionally," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed, "so I have noticed it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the way," asked McNeill casually,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he made a strong effort to control</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice, "you never found out who sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">you those roses?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--no one has claimed the honor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You,are quite sure you didn't leave a stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing order, Neill?

It will probably pass."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, I won't worry about it. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably a matter of circulation. I'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be more careful of my diet and cut off</seg><seg type="columnLine">candy I suppose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neill laughed with her and then, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberately forcing back all emotion, he pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded to the test he dreaded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Won't you play something?" he asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadying his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She went over to the piano and Neill</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a point of choosing something that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">must play by note. To aid her in this he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on the piano lights and then settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in a chair that gave him a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of her face, turning it, as she did</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally, toward him. To the ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary observer there would have seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing out of the ordinary, save that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was very fair to look upon with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect oval, the scarlet lips and the steady,</seg><seg type="columnLine">large eyes beneath curving, delicately pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciled brows. It was at these latter that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neill directed his closest attention, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he managed to hide it from her, smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he met her gaze.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Dragon's Claw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">171</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PPJI WHEN he left her that night, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">|Oj|a nails had cut deeply into his palms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       "The cowards!" he said. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">curs! And there is no remedy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the hotel he made discreet inquiries</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the flower stand--inquiries sped by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jovial talk and augmented with a liberal</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip. He traced the flowers. There had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been no special attempt to hide their source,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save from the lack of a card--a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily explained by blaming an underling</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary who would shoulder the responsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility in case of inquiry. They had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered by the secretary of the two Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">princes. A not too unusual compliment</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the distinguished foreigners to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter of the president of the museum</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose soiree they had attended, and who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been placed on the list of guests at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">banquet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flowers and their deadly thorns had</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded and long since been cast away, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be recovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they had accomplished their purpose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Achieved the deadly end of the fiends who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sent them.

Leprosy was infectious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the thorns had been impregnated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deadly virus.- The evidence was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed, but the girl was sentenced to a loath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some, ever encroaching dissolution, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which there was no cure. Only a horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">segregation under the law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Black murder welled up in McNeill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he forced it down. Remsden was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to blame primarily and he, too, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be hard hit, for Neill felt that he loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stepdaughter. As for the Orientals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been hit and they had struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">back according to their lights. And Helen?</seg><seg type="columnLine">His clear brain reeled for a few moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he contemplated the awful fate ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her--a fate that he determined to share</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as nearly as he would be allowed. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">there must be, should be, a reckoning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">First doctors must be privately consulted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen must be persuaded to see them on</seg><seg type="columnLine">some pretext, the stiffening of her finger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lack of circulation, but she must not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed to suspect. It would drive a girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her vitality, her love of life, her sensitive-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, insane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For himself he could only determine one</seg><seg type="columnLine">course.

You will be held</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for the actions of your secretary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite any denial he may make. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorns were impregnated with the virus of</seg><seg type="columnLine">leprosy, which was communicated to Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remsden, as you hoped, by the pricking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her hand. Those thorns have been sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected to analysis, not thrown away, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you expected.

Your rank may keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">you from imprisonment, but your failure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make the loan, the general loathing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion that will be cast upon all Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">diplomacy and personality will not serve</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make you popular with your govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. The evidence is in the hands of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">Secret Service, or will be turned over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them either upon my order or in case I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not leave these rooms unscathed or am in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">any way interfered with. I have spoken."</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill stopped talking, unable to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">from those impassive masks what effect his</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful indictment had made. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">largely bluff. Remsden did have influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the wires had been busy ever since</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had disclosed to Remsden the state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his daughter's health. But they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to recover the roses. Still the cards</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hidden and the stakes were big.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will converse in English," answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ten Shin imperturbably.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that Miss Remsden is not of Howard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remsden's own blood is, I should imagine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a factor.

The costumes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the guests, the elaborately bizarre</seg><seg type="columnLine">decorations, the strange music, the unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">dishes spiced with a bountiful supply of</seg><seg type="columnLine">occidental vintages, the courtesy of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hosts, the exotic atmosphere--all had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the affair a success from the start. Rare</seg><seg type="columnLine">souvenirs, not to be priced,Â«had augmented</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entente cordiale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the cessation of gastronomies came</seg><seg type="columnLine">an entertainment of wizardry, of parlor</seg><seg type="columnLine">acrobatics, of indoor fireworks, until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildered beholders were brought to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiring point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, at the sound of a gong, a booth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was brought in--a hooded tent of silken</seg><seg type="columnLine">brocades, and Ten Shin arose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Much of which you have so courteously</seg><seg type="columnLine">shared with us tonight," he said, "belongs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to the past--the passing China soon, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope, to be revivified with lessons learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from American ingenuity and advancement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there is one element that always</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeals, particularly to the fair sex. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">element is the future. A member of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">little embassy has arrived today from China,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing important matters and, while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been too fatigued from his long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">accelerated journey to join us, he has con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented to give some manifestation of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">skill as a diviner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a murmur of anticipatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">delight and again the gong sounded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From behind high curtains four Chinamen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in vivid emerald silk, brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward a palanquin of brightest scarlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacquer on which were illuminated golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragons in raised and lustrous metal work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Six-clawed they were, noted McNeill, tense</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sense of something pregnant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This they placed by the tent and disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A weird chant, high pitched, nerve</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrilling, came from unseen musicians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shrill piping of the Chinese clarionet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the twang of the gekken. The room</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very quiet and the lights grew gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim. Then the scarlet curtains of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palanquin glowed fiery red, faint streaks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight appeared through the folds of the tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a figure emerged from the carriage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was clad in silk of the vividest yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the robes, McNeill noticed, as his fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped those of Helen next to him, were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">priestly cut. The figure was squat. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">its rotundity it might have been ludicrous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save for a certain dignity that emanated</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it and because of that of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">princely hosts. The face, projecting from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the folds of the hood, was that of a turtle--</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that of Tao Chan, high-priest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hoang Lung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill was not surprized. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked the effort Helen made to suppress</seg><seg type="columnLine">her feelings of astonishment and, perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of terror, though there was, as he assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, no fear of anything out of the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">happening there with so many American</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests present. Yet there was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that thrilled him with a sense of hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">power--of mystery. He glanced at Rems-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den. Remsden was staring at Tao Chan</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he might have looked at a basilisk, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes projecting, his lower jaw sagging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tao Chan had evidently arrived with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the duplicate, leaving some excuse, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">174</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps a second replica, behind him. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was to be exchanged for the original.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everybody's face was to be satfed. Helen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Chinese drugs, to be cured, Remsden</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be left as president, and relieved of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Damoclean fate. Only the museum would</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffer and be none the worse for it, thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNeill, knowing other spurious objects</seg><seg type="columnLine">venerated there as real.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He, Neill McNeill, had brought this</seg><seg type="columnLine">about by taking advantage of China's</seg><seg type="columnLine">position as the Sick Man of Asia, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to America for aid. The princes had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a dual purpose--to get the claw and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to establish friendly relations. Which cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">they held the greater McNeill did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture to imagine. He did not care,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling certain that the evening would see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of their troubles unless Remsden</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved obstinate. In this case McNeill</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised himself that he would devise a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little pressure on his own account.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ten Shin turned to the ladv on his right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Would you read the future?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. "I am sure that for you it will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">rosy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tao Chan had entered the little tent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken his seat before a stand of dark wood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the legs formed of writhing dragons. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a dish in front of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You will not be spirited away, I assure</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," went on the prince. "I will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarantee that you will not be enchanted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but turn about is fair play."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guest laughed nervously at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">raillery but consented to enter the tent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The curtains closed and there was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a low murmur to be heard, drowned largely</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the rising notes of the orchestra. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than two minutes the woman came out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">' "Your wizard is a flatterer, prince," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I wish I could believe half he</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised, though he does not speak very</seg><seg type="columnLine">good English."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has learned it for the occasion,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Ten Shin gravely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Liu Chi next asked his dinner partner</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she disappeared. McNeill could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first visitant answering questions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I can't describe it," she replied. "Wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">till your turn. He showed me a funny plate</seg><seg type="columnLine">first and then--I don't remember really</seg><seg type="columnLine">what happened. It was all over so quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he told me a lot of strange things that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might come true. I hope so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chinese hypnotism," whispered McNeill</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Helen under cover of the chatter. "He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">read her own wishes. It will be your turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">next. Don't be afraid. It is going to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. I can guess what they are after."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At Liu Chi's request Helen went into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">booth, remaining there a little longer than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the rest. When she came out she was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pale, and McNeill handed her a glass of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't talk now," he said. "Tell us</seg><seg type="columnLine">later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">, She nodded brightly at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It sounded like good news," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Some of the fairer guests refused; others</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">accepted and the novelty began to wane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tao Chan pleaded, or pretended to plead,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">exhaustion, and withdrew in the palanquin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then the lights went up. Ten Shin arose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a toast to the United States and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">another orchestra, typically American,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">broke spiritedly into the "Star Spangled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Banner." The brilliant assemblage rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As the strains died, Liu Chi made his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">peroration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Heliogabalus," he said, "smothered his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">guests to death with rose petals. Tonight it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is my cousin and myself who are smothered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with your good-will, but not to death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And, though roses grow in China, we have a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more typical flower that bears the charm of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sweet forgetfulness--the faculty of dream-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">less sleep. The lotus!

Then as they passed on he</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched Remsden on the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A word with you, sir," he said pleas-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">antly, and envious guests marked Remsden</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as one given spacial favors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">â¡ THE two waited for Remsden in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the anteroom. He came to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last with the face of one who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen his own ghost--his features twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a man who has suffered a stroke. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way back to the limousine he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak but plucked clumsily at his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers. At the house he achieved speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an effort, as if his lingual muscles had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered paralysis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Dragon's Claw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">175</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neill and I will join you when you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken off your wraps, Helen," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked anxiously at him and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the drawing-room," she replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men went into the library. Remsden</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured brandy and gulped it down. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sank into the cushions of a big chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a man of ninety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the matter with Helen, Neill?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked thickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leprosy," answered McNeill bluntly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remsden clawed at the arms of the chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasping for breath and speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" he said. "I never thought--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ten Shin said--he said that--as a bruised</seg><seg type="columnLine">plum is to a rotten fruit, as a stained pearl to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bowl of slime, so should my punishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">be compared to hers. Oh, my God, Neill!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Brace up," snapped McNeill. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">else did he say? About the claw?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am to show it him at the museum</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow--Tao Chan I mean.

I must see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNeill guessed what the adjustment</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be. A little legerdemain, such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilson had shown in the desert, this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Tao Chan as the prestidigitator.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But had Remsden already been inoculated?</seg><seg type="columnLine">How was he to be cured?

"Do you fancy that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are already infected?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Remsden nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know it," he groaned. "Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">pricked my palm when I shook hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Ten Shin, and he smiled when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">started. But Helen--Helen has an anti-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dote.

Well, this old chart</seg><seg type="columnLine">was found when I was a school kid and I left school</seg><seg type="columnLine">when 16, and am 36 years old now. My uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">died in 1894 and he and a chum found this old</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle in 1889. So how does that rhyme with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Comrade Young's statement?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It's queer that there are two old - about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the !jcality of the bay and rivers indicated; also</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good clear spring in a line with that tree and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the anchorage; also that tree, which I have found</seg><seg type="columnLine">and identified--by markings, which are similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some on the old chart which Edgar Young no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt can describe. What I can not understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">is how he wrote it in 1910 and it was found in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1889, as I have ascertained by going over some files</seg><seg type="columnLine">of old letters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JsJOW, I'm not boosting this thing for publicity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    I'm on the "lone" trail in this thing and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to believe that there is a rich find for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. If, however, Edgar Young can describe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">old chart and explain how it was written in 1910</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found in lhe Fall of 1889; also how I knew of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and took it to the high school principal here when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a school kid of 14 or so and was a man of 27 when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was written, that's too psychological for me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehend. I would like to get hold of that old</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of that pirate Hlackbume as I think I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">located Lhe old fellow's favorite rendezvous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wonder if Edgar Young can tell me where to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get it.

If his. claim is authentic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and true, then the whole thing is a hoax perpe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated and invented for the purpose of misleading</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deceiving. It certainly accomplished its pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose if so, for I know I've spent hours untold in</seg><seg type="columnLine">corresponding about it and had offers to buy it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from folks who could decipher part of it and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">all (so they said), but were particularly anxious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the original.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This has been no joke in our family.---.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And here is Edgar Young's reply:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                   Brooklyn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first thing that occurred to me when I read</seg><seg type="columnLine">what that fellow had to say about the Capitan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blackbume manuscript was to shut up like a clam.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He has his dates wrong and seems set on making</seg><seg type="columnLine">a liar out of me.

Elsewhere a guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">is unnecessary and a nuisance. The country is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">big and services of guides so little in demand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are no such things that are reliable. Any</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons dependable in the States here are usable</seg><seg type="columnLine">and satisfactory in Alaska, except that for bull</seg><seg type="columnLine">moose and the Alaska grizzly--a not very frequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">met animal--you want a pretty fairly heavy bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun of high power. Otherwise, as to firearms in</seg><seg type="columnLine">general, I advise light ones to meet the difficulty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting over the ground, which is not inconsiderable</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the north, and which calls for as light equipment</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I couldn't promise you "excitement" for a Winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Alaska, as it's a rather quiet country and you do</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a bit of traveling for what you see and get.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But if you're looking for a change, and solitude and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildness, and a fair amount of game, that's the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You could ascend or descend a river to a suitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, in a canoe, taking enough essentials for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winter in the country. But I do not advise this</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless you're bridle-wise to the undertaking. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">means Living mostly on the country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You'd need little equipment.

Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">1739, 12,728 gold mines have made good, and fcr</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past year the average in gold exported has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been over 300,000 dollars' worth per month. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of silver that has been exported staggers</seg><seg type="columnLine">the imagination. Colombia also furnished the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world with the bulk of its emeralds, mainly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the famous Muzo district, from which emeralds</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been mined since immemorial times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The platinum of Colombia is much purer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Russian metal and the supply "is increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">yearly. Formerly this metal was thrown away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was a source of much trouble to the miners</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get rid of it from the gold. Now they are dig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging up the streets where it was formerly thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">and panning the dirt. Copper, tin, lead, zinc,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercury, antimony, arsenic, sulphur, coal, asphalt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">petroleum, iron, rubies, sapphires, garnets, ame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thysts are being extracted and exported.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, for the prospector, due to the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colombia has been fairly well prospected over, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would suggest Ecuador as a more likely spot to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a rich strike. This is the same kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">country and the minerals have scarcely been</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched. I was talking last week to a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the trip from Rio Bamba by foot to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Napo, and on down to Iquitos by boat, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me he saw the Indians with lots of dust to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is a tribe of very hostile Indians called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Jiveros, or Jivaros, up above where he struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, and it is impossible to get up into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, due to the fact that they will not allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white man nor neighboring Indians to enter. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's name is Walter R. Johnson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I was in Ecuador a few years ago I met</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with a Mr. Morley at Huigra and he also told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me about rich gold country over there. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a party went in and the lone man who came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, a negro, the ninth man of the party, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out at Para, brought a huge bag of very</seg><seg type="columnLine">large nuggets out with him. He was crazy as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loon, but drew a map after he got back here in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States. Another party came down</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the map this negro had made and after they</seg><seg type="columnLine">went in nothing was ever heard ol them. Walter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnson told me they were above the little village</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Napo. which is Jivero, and bad country. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">says there &gt;s no danger below this village, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty of it above. Also he claimed the Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very'tame after you leave Napo going down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream. The way he put it, he said he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarantee that a man struck good placer ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this river. The Ecuadorian people are buffa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loed by those Indians over there, and there is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance that there is a bonanza located there. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can take that with salt if you want to; you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ask Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">how visionary we old prospectors get to be, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walt is as bad as I am.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That is the country I would pick if I went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in South America to prospect, due to the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons: Colombia has been pretty well located</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, Peru was worked Out fairly well by the Incas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bolivia is solid full of mineral, and has many com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panies looking it over, Chili is mostly nitrates, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">water is scarce.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My next bet would be either Venezuela or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guianas, and then northern Brazil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is a railroad operated by an American</seg><seg type="columnLine">company running up into the interior of Ecuador</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Quito from Duran, just across the river from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guayaquil. Guayaquil is a hell-hole for fever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but after an hour's ride you arc above the fever</seg><seg type="columnLine">line and it begins to get cool. You can go from</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea level to perpetual snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The climate after you get into the high plateau</seg><seg type="columnLine">about 10,000 feet high, is delightful. The good</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospecting country is on the eastern slope of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, to my notion, in the extreme headwaters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rivers flowing into the Amazon. Right at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rio Bamba you cross a stream that could float a</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe which flows into the Amazon. It could</seg><seg type="columnLine">float one, but it would be hard work, for it's just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few feet across at this point. I looked at it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this view in mind and believe by wading part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way until a man reached more water he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">run a canoe right from Rio Bamba, if he took it</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy and did not get smashed up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is a road running back into the Archidona</seg><seg type="columnLine">district from Quito, and the trip can be made by</seg><seg type="columnLine">mule to Papallacta. There is a man in Papallacta</seg><seg type="columnLine">who sends mules to Quito to bring people out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From there it's pack work with Indian packers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think they charge five dollars (U. S.) for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen days pack (per Indian) from Papallacta</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Napo, packing about a hundred pounds. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian packers are wonders. I just came across</seg><seg type="columnLine">a note in "Quito to Bogota," by A. C. Veatch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which mentions them sending a message one hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred miles in a day by an Indian runner through</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough country. There are other records of runs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 250 and 300 miles that are unbelievable by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man. They have been bred for the purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from ancient times.

Second class is much less,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a hammock and a few dollars to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steward, is not bad.

The climate of Korea is temperate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with snows in Winter and rarely higher tem[&gt;era-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture than 90 degrees in Summer. The Korean</seg><seg type="columnLine">root is collected after the first frost, when the sap</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plant has all gone to the root. It is pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared after an elaborate native formula of macera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in rice water and drying in a closed pot over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slow fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Offhand, I should say that the great difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your climate over the Korean would prohibit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the success of its growing with you.
