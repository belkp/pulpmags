            <seg type="columnLine">Things were shaping themselves better than</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had dared hope. Forty men, more or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">less asleep. Forty men would certainly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mean a considerable number of unlocked</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> And he was. There was no interruption</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to his search. The first room into which</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that by the split volume and syncopation</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of their snores--and this room yielded a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">suit of tan that would, the Kid believed,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">conveniently cover Dake's body. Carrying</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> This time, after trying five doors and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and harkened to the snores. They came,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">regular though subdued. Creeping to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bed, the Kid saw the dim bulk of clothing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">piled upon a chair, lifted the breeches he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">found, held them against his waist, and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Quickly going through the pockets, he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in the pocket under the belt. These he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a symbol o.i the sleeve of the blouse</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">back to the first room he had frisked--it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was rough on a guy, the Kid felt, to deprive</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and in November, too. It might be, after</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">up in the suburban telephone-book. Name</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and address appeared to correspond, per-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fectly. Then--just for assurance which</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">IVyanomah and got Harry Bradford, the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">would need a confidential interview with</seg>
