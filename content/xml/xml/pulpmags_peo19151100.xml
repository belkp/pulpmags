Then, as early in the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he thought admissible, he* went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Mrs. Brookfield; and had the sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isfaction, on leaving her, of knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was as happy as hope could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make her under the circumstances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last thing he did was to see Colo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel St. John and get from him his cre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dentials and the promised letter.

And yet it was certainly unlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel St. John, who had treated him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout with an almost ceremonious</seg><seg type="columnLine">courtesy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time, the vessel was gliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly out into the river, hugging the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wharf closely. As she went out, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups on the wharf began to break up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and straggle away. Once more Talbot</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the man who had shadowed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this time he was with another man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whom he was talking earnestly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Talbot looked after them, smiling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet puzzled. There was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar about the second man, and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not place him in his memory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tried for a moment to do so; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismissed the matter. It seemed too</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridiculous to think about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ridiculous as it was, however, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind continued to revert to the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the effort to place him.

She laughed easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">but softly, and in a way that was a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light to listen to. In fact, Talbot found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself waiting for the low, musical</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripple. It was exactly such a laugh as</seg><seg type="columnLine">one might expect from the possessor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a voice of such golden richness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her beauty was of rather a sensuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort; her lips full and very red--natu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rally so, Talbot decided very quickly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin milky white and running into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell-like pink in her round cheeks;</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of a soft, melting brown; white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even teeth; a round, full throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Talbot also noted that her eyelashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very long and dark, her hair wavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of a lustrous brown, her chin de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liciously rounded and with a tiny but</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-defined dimple in it. Indeed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimples she had a great plenty. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in her cheeks most adorably when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she smiled in the slightest degree; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on her hands. No doubt they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be found at her elbows and--if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she ever wore her gowns so low--on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for her figure, it did justice to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, being exquisitely rounded without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aid of superfluous fat. All her</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements were free and graceful, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if a natural health and strength had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been supplemented by careful training.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When Talbot saw her on deck later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she made him think of a well-fed pan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As his attitude toward the sex was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a pose, he did not hesitate to admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">bis pleasure in her any more than if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been a beautiful horse. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he discovered, as he soon did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she paid no more attention to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he did to her. he watched and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyed her with careless frankness, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meantime eating his lunch and leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the table as if she didn't exist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only other person 011 board who</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested him at all was the young man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">who had brought him word of the box</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of samples from the colonel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This young man was a good-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow, who gave the horses an eager,</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent attention, who was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert and always trim in appearance*</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was the first to greet Talbot when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter went down among the horses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was always unobtrusively ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer any question or to jump to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was so constantly cheerful, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready with his agreeable smile, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time so competent, that Tal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bot. before the day was out, had prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically made him foreman over the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did you learn about horses?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked the young fellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On a ranch in Montana."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what are you going over with</seg><seg type="columnLine">these horses for?

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed, and went on unhesitatingly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is private business that takes me</seg><seg type="columnLine">over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pardon my question," Talbot said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. "I really asked because I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ranch in Texas, and am always glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get hold of a good man. You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">my name?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir; it's Talbot." He smiled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his engaging way. "They call you Talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Talbot.'' He looked his admiration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A silly name," said Talbot curtly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harry Furness shrugged his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders and watched Talbot walk away, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint, odd smile curling the corners of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Late in the afternoon, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and boarded by a British</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser. Talbot was surprised, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken it for granted that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be known that the ship carried horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the British army in France.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The ship's papers were perfunctorily</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined; and then the crew and pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">TALKING TALBOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers were examined with great care</seg><seg type="columnLine">and particularity. It was then that Tal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bot learned that the beautiful young</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman was Mrs. Frank Parker, of San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco, and a widow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The person in charge of the exami-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation of the passengers and crew was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a naval officer, but a civilian; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he plainly knew definitely what to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Talbot was surprised to find that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was treated with unusual courtesy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scarcely questioned. He immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately concluded that his mission was</seg><seg type="columnLine">known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other passengers were treated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with varying degrees of inquisitiveness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some being quickly dismissed and others</seg><seg type="columnLine">being questioned minutely. Talbot got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impression that the inquisitor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking some special person or bit of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Parker, when her turn came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">submitted with quiet dignity to the ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioning, never showing any signs of im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience when the man pushed his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiries to an extreme. Even when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked as if the man suspected her of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being other than she asserted, she did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not lose her calmness, but replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily and placidly, and occasionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">smilingly, to the questions he asked her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess," growled a man to Talbot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"he's taking advantage of the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk to her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Talbot smiled. "I don't know," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered, thinking of the way he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been shadowed; "a lot of fool things</seg><seg type="columnLine">are done these days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd like to punch his jaw for talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that little woman that way," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Talbot remembered that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been paying assiduous court to Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then the inquisitor suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to question the lady, and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">her with a bow that was almost pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Talbot, with a smile, "it</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks as if the fellow had succumbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to those fascinating dimples."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other passenger broke at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a rhapsody over the lady's beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and charm, to which Talbot shut his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears, not being interested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one else on board was subjected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the same close scrutiny as the Cali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fornia widow until Talbot's young</seg><seg type="columnLine">helper, Harry Furness, was reached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His examination took precisely the</seg><seg type="columnLine">course that hers had. In spite of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaging frankness and the readiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his replies to the most searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions, the inquisition was persisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in rudely, and then suddenly dropped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Talbot had a fashion of noting small</seg><seg type="columnLine">things and putting them away in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain. He did so in this instance, puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zling over the matter for a few mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and then dismissing it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning, when he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to look at the horses, Harry said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, in a low tone: "Do you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what's in that box, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The one for the commissary depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is supposed to have samples in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't know what kind.

He had seen it before, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">had paid no special attention to it. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he leaned over it and examined it</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he stood quite still and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly breathed; then he turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at Harry, who was watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When did you discover this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This morning.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the letter from the colonel, the letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the familiar address.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's your idea?" he demanded of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought it might be a bomb."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is possible.

That, he considered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the least they should do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he set out that afternoon, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had his belt of ^cartridges, besides his</seg><seg type="columnLine">money belt, on.

His heart sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that; but, as he was beyond the limit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ruined garden, he hoped it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not significant of her absence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He carefully climbed up and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">astride the wall. He detached the loop</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the stone, doubled the rope, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doubled end over the stone, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid down, pulling the rope after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had so far seen 110 one, nor heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">any suspicious sound. He hugged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall so that the shrubs growing at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglected base would hide him, and, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealed, crept along to the garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sort of fence that once had marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limits of the garden had been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed by a natural hedge of currant</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes and other wilder growths. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pushed his way through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cottage stood about fifty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him.

He could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the princess leading the way up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path, making a picture of dignity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathos. She looked so helpless, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, so alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long distance he kept between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall and the shrubbery; then, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">castle came nearer, he was able to steal</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and use trees and clumps of shrub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bery for concealment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The castle was a huge building, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">set of buildings; for, although con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected by covered passages, it really</seg><seg type="columnLine">consisted of the castle proper and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole village of subordinate buildings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smoke issued from the chimneys of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main building, and from what Tal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bot judged to be the chimneys of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">servants' quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although still fairly light out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors, it was evidently dark enough in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors to require lights; for from open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings in the curtains of the great win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows of the second floor streaks of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A deep and wide moat surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the castle, but there was no water in it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the drawbridge was permanently</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over this bridge the men marched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">led by the slightly swaying figure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">princess.

He wondered if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had begun yet to question if he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever be able to find her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not in his heart to blame the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor child if she doubted him, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see no way yet of doing anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He crept warily near to the castle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited, hoping something would occur</seg><seg type="columnLine">to suggest a plan to him. In a few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes the squad of soldiers with the of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficer marched out again, broke ranks on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the turf and went in disorder to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">servants' quarters, laughing and talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While they were filing out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, a light broke out in one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows on the lower floor to the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the drawbridge. That window was</seg><seg type="columnLine">grated, as was plainly evident, and Tal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bot knew that it was where Sonia had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been placed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was something too sinister</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this disposition of the girl to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted, and Talbot could see her</seg><seg type="columnLine">drooping and losing all hope. If he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only get a word to her to revive</seg><seg type="columnLine">her spirits!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He studied the place as well as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could at the distance, and it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that where the wall of the castle</seg><seg type="columnLine">had once presented a smooth surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the way down it had in the course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time been worn away at the level of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water in the moat so that perhaps there</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be foothold there now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was growing darker rapidly, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he felt safe in approaching nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the castle. Finally he found a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gave him a view into the lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drew in his breath as he looked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was plainly a cell, but it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made fairly comfortable with furniture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though that fact did not seem to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">much weight with the princess, who sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the side of the little bed, a listless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathetic picture of utter loneliness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fury of rage shook Talbot as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked.

He trusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his skill as an athlete to help him</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, however; and presently was near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the window from which the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking in first to be sure she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, he tapped 011 the glass.

He saw no way but to act blindly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To be reckless under such conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be wise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Acting on this conclusion, he listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment at the door that had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">been closed, and then opened it. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver was in his hand, every sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door, as it turned out, was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary one made in the great arch</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had once opened from the draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge into a semicircular courtyard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The massive grating that had once</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded the entrance bad been replaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">by masonry, excepting for the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied by the door. The courtyard</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained as it had been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In front of him, at the top of a flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of broad stone steps, was a great, wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">door which manifestly opened into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the castle-occupied by the noble</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner. At bis left, on the level of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone flagging, was a small, plain door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A similar door opened at his right. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">much was plainly visible even in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took it for granted that the Count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ess Elsa and her companions had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in by the great door at the center; also</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the door at the right led to the part</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the princess was imprisoned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His heart gave a bound. Why not</seg><seg type="columnLine">take this opportunity to free her and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">escape? It was a thing so little ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected by her captors that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken no pains to guard her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was no sooner in his brain than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was executing it. lie ran to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and pulled it open. Once inside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was in total darkness; but after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment or two of hesitation he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to see where a streak of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the blackness of the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Feeling his way along the wall until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came to the light, he then tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find some way of looking into the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">to assure himself that it was the one he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought. The door was tight, however.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He might have spoken to her, but if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it really were she who was there, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">woidd serve no good purpose, and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were not, the sound might serve to</seg><seg type="columnLine">notify some unfriendly person that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger was there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He felt about for the lock, and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the door was secured by a padlock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strap and staples of which were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">-heavy wrought iron, although the lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself was ordinary. It would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">withstood almost any pressure from</seg><seg type="columnLine">within, but was easily breakable from</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With any ordinary tool, or even with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stout stick of wood, it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a matter of only a minute to burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">the padlock; as it was, he took the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in both hands, and, exerting his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, began twisting it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was not easy to do, and it was sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral minutes before the loop of the lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to give way; but once it did be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gin, progress was swift. When the lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">came apart, perspiration was rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down Talbot's face. Fie wiped it has-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tily away and pulled the door open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The princess had heard him working</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her door, and, not suspecting that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be he, had been alarmed; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he saw her, she was at the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the little cell, her back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, her great gray eyes staring in</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Sonia!" he cried softly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir Chester!

He spoke in Hungarian, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his meaning was clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was very dark where they were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Talbot followed the baluster rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found it ran around a sort of bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conv that looked down into the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">half.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From inside the lighted room rose a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hubbub of voices, followed by an erup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion into the hall of the persons there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A swift questioning of the man took</seg><seg type="columnLine">place on the part of Prince Szchymsl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose rage grew as he learned what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly a voice rose clear and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinct above the others.

If they were going to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">avowed enemies, the case would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been different; but it seemed quite cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain that whover these people were, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished the princess no harm, so that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be wiser to accept the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and escape later if need there were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The substance of this he said to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">princess.

After-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward he learned that it was the duke's</seg><seg type="columnLine">own castle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was another kind of trouble, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least it was not one that meant any</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediate danger for the princess, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far preferable to the peril he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescued her from.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The duke was still standing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway, peering out into the darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Talbot bent over the. shrinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl and whispered: "Play your part</seg><seg type="columnLine">boldly, Sonia.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">duke maintained his place by the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the princess, his handsome but dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sipated face glowing with delight as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down at her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was much talk, but it was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Hungarian, and therefore unintelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gible to Talbot, until the duke said</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that made the gay throng</seg><seg type="columnLine">open out before him and the princess.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then she turned and, looking straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Talbot, said in German:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I owe my liberty to this American</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman.

She was very unlike the timid</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl of the old garden, Talbot thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her gown was not unlike the one she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just worn, but was a pale yellow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She wore no jewels at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was her manner that made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great difference. She bore herself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of fierce pride. When she en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the room she stopped and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">imperiously about. Only when her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell on Talbot did her face soften.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Disregarding everybody else, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">went directly to him, waving Szolnak</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside when he attempted to interpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will have my way," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why create a scandal?" he asked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a low tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any scandal is of your making," sh.e</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and passed on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked wonderfully beautiful as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she approached Talbot, but he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her resolve, whatever its nature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had only hardened in the interval. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy he and she might have been, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, but for these meddlers! Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if only the cord would give!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir," she said to the lieutenant, "re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire a few paces!" And when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done so her face relaxed in a sad, sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. "Dear one," she murmured to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Talbot, "this is my farewell. I am sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am doing the only thing I could do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But do not doubt me. No other kiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">but yours shall ever touch my lips. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am a coward now only in my inability</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see you suffer. In other things I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know I shall be brave. I am glad you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came to me. Love is worth everything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let me press your lips once more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She bent forward, and with her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his shoulders pressed his lips with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a cry of rage from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">duke, and a murmur of wonder went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the whole assemblage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-by, sweetheart!" he said. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be for a long time or for a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. I can see that you have some des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate plan in your mind. Wait two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days at least. Give me that much</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will if I can," she answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They exchanged one more look, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it seemed to both of them as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole religion of love was revealed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then she turned and went to where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">archbishop stood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am ready," she said to him. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">the duke she said: "You may win a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crown by this; you will not get a wife."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked her over with a glance at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once wrathful and appraising. "I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the risk of that," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They took their places side by side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a hush fell on the room. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if the strangeness of the wedding</seg><seg type="columnLine">oppressed their spirits. The prelate</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his place in front of the couple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked about him as if he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">call attention to the fact that to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing unusual in the situ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment there was a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion in the hall. The duke looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the door in annoyance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurry, monseigneur!" said Szolnak</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a low tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Talbot, who by reason of his stature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and because of where he stood, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see better than any of the other prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cipal actors into the hall, started in</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise, and stared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The archbishop cleared his throat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started to speak. A movement at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway, and then a clear, rich,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocking voice rang out:</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come then, prince!

When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beyond them, and could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway, he stopped with a muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">oath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Prince Szchymsl and a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman stood there, side by side. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew without being told that the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the Countess Elsa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Count Szolnak!" said the prince.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are we in time for the ceremony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">count?" demanded the countess; then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely followed by the prince, who bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself fiercely, while she was all radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant smiles, she swept forward through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throng that parted to let her pass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came into view of the wedding</seg><seg type="columnLine">party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah!" the prince cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid we interrupt," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">countess, her lips smiling, but her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming. "Do we interrupt Count Szol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nak?" she demanded, turning to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bowed low. "It has just begun,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said in a low voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Princess Sonia turned her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">indifferently. The duke had been star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the newcomers. The prince he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew too well to look at twice; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman he did not know, but he guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">who she was as readily as Szolnak had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done; so it was no surprise to him when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the princess cried out:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Countess Elsa!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The archbishop changed color, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped back.

"But. dear</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, Princess Sonia, is this the way you</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep your word? You were to take no</seg><seg type="columnLine">further part in the revolution. Which</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminds me. Where is our friend, Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chester ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, countess," he answered ; "here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting your kindly help."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The countess looked in his direction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and such persons as had crowded be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween moved away.

"What! They actually have</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome the invincible hero!" She</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed again, and then turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the princess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was something so sinister in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this look that fear woke in the unhappy</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, and with a cry she ran to Tal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bot's side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If only I were free!" he panted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She began to tug at his bonds, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">her little hands were quite inadequate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the task. "I can do nothing,-' she</seg><seg type="columnLine">moaned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Talbot raged, but was helpless.

There was nothing to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">but await the issue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Countess," said Szolnak, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been exchanging glances with some and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispers with others of the nobles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"with your permission we will go on</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the wedding.

And in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment she had reached the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer who stood apart with his drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had no notion of what was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to happen, and was staring wonderingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this beautiful woman who had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn everything into a turmoil; so</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had no difficulty in snatching his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword out of his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sonia saw her coming with her glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering weapon, and feared at once for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Talbot. She cried out and threw her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in front of him. "No, no!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried. "You shall not!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The countess laughed aloud. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">really' is so, then," she said. "Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chester, if I set you free and the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">princess, too, will you stand by me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Talbot understood the instant the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words were spoken. "With all my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, countess," he answered, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurned his back to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment the cord was cut. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grim laugh, Talbot turned. "We can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail, countess," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We need only a few minutes," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said in a low tone. "Do anything to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep them occupied. There will be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">regiment of hussars here in a few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes. Take the sword."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have my revolver," he answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He asked no questions because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood the whole plan. Now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was free he knew how to act. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that the nobles had been so taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">aback by the act of the countess that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were unable to do anything. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply stared at each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not a situation to be thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. With a leap he was by the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the duke, his revolver at his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One movement,'' he said threaten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly', "and I will put a bullet in your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brain.

What</seg><seg type="columnLine">fools you are! Do you think this child</seg><seg type="columnLine">is fit to lead a revolution? Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to lose your heads? Do you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can win because you marry these</seg><seg type="columnLine">two ? Where would you be without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money I bring and the regiments the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prince contributes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the logical thing to do, count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ess," answered Szolnak, recovering</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his stupefaction at finding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables so suddenly turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The duke sullenly said something in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hungarian. The countess burst into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-tempered laugh, and answered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">German: "Sir Chester, do you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what his highness says? He tells me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if he had first seen me he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have been so warm for the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">alliance. Are you not angry with such</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor judgment?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Talbot smiled grimly.

Yet he was not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to refuse a good offer, and, trust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to his wits to extricate him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difficulty, he promptly closed with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His highness is of the Mohammedan</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PLUNDER SHIP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">faith," he said grandiloquently.

He walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">round the reef as far as the channel</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, and devoted the best part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day to finishing his investigation, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result that before sunset he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquainted with every one of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nections, and was in a position to switch</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on or off at will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By nightfall he was back again at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot where the steam siren stood silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the absence of its guardian angel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob Kent.

The course steered</seg><seg type="columnLine">was straight for the sheltering palms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, like music on his ears, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded the thud of the screw, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little later the hoarse cries of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand as the steamer rounded to within</seg><seg type="columnLine">biscuit throw of the shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Whatever happened now. being</seg><seg type="columnLine">within easy ear shot, he could com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municate with the ship at will; but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited a little to see if a boat would</seg><seg type="columnLine">put off. None came. On the contrary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the signs of activity on deck decreased,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he could see indistinct forms tum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling into the fo'c'sle.

Then we came back</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, and I'm called out of my bunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some sort of racket that I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">rightly understand, except that I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">main glad to see you in the flesh again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Lynden. I never thought to."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walter patted him on the back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no time for gush. "Ferrars</seg><seg type="columnLine">was talking about some old nigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd brought from Seluga," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's on board now, isn't he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye--a cruel job," replied Telfer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The old chap came worrying around</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a canoe, and at first they stood him</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. Then they changed their minds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">invited him aboard, and clapped him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">irons. The canoe they stove in, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poor black devils in her had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swim through the sharks for the shore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ferrars and Booth go down and do</seg><seg type="columnLine">things to that old man every night--it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">my belief with hot irons. Anyway, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes him scream."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walter shuddered, but a hail came</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the water and claimed him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sea Hawk had begun to forge slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the mouth of the channel, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice from her was that of Laban</seg><seg type="columnLine">Booth :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're on the move; sing out when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're to stop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can keep on, and stop twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards from the first bend," Walter re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied. and, bidding the diver follow, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">led the way along the bank of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">channel to the first mine, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just round the first acute angle in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zed. It was a contact mine, designed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be fired by a passing vessel striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wire stretched taut from an iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">peg in either bank and communicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a branch wire with the explosive</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber under water. It was not by</seg><seg type="columnLine">any means a perfect contrivance, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that was necessary to make the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PLUNDER SHIP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sage safe was to detach the wire from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the pegs and pay out the slack</seg><seg type="columnLine">till it dropped to the bottom clear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship's keel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walter correctly guessed that the ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangement had been devised for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">convenience of the Tulwar and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessels belonging to Jogore, which when</seg><seg type="columnLine">requiring to pass would land a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lower the wires to safety and tighten</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up again when the vessel had</seg><seg type="columnLine">traversed the danger point. The secur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity of the channel, in fact, depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the locality of the pegs, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret of their use being only known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to vessels authorized to use it. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">that knowledge any vessel, authorized</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not, could have passed safely to and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fro at will but for an additional pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caution. Close to the inner or lagoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the channel there were a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mines contrived to be fired by elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity from some point on the island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weak point in this part of the sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem being that these two mines de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended for their efficacy on the lookout</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was kept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walter had only found the iron peg</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a prolonged exploration, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible by his enforced idleness on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoll during the past week. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven into the rock a foot below high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">water mark, and at full tide they, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their coil of extra wire, were invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">either from the channel or the bank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was to this discovery that he owed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inspiration of the idea that now</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You had better not watch me too</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely," he said to Telfer when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the first angle in the zigzag</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage. "It may come in handy to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be able to swear that you couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the place. I shall want you later</seg><seg type="columnLine">on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swung himself over the shelving</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank, and found the peg under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Having done what was needful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hailed the Sea Hawk that she might</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely round the bend. When she had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">done so he hailed again that she must</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceed slowly and then stop as before</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the next angle. As he did not im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately reappear, Mark Telfer went</seg><seg type="columnLine">and peered over the bank and saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantically busy below, his body sway-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing apd one arm waving with a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular motion. It was much too dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Walter's movements to be seen from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the now slowly receding ship, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any case they would have been unin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligible to those on board. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expert in subaqueous matters, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had a grim significance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, you're never-" the diver</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was beginning in a throaty whisper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Walter silenced him with an angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sooner you realize that a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much may cost your life the bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter," whispered Walter as he rejoined</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on the bank.

A contented grin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had replaced the look of alarmed sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise that had furrowed his good-hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mored face at first sight of his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion's maneuvers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the second mine exactly the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">performance was gone through; the Sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk passed the dangerous point in</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety, and Walter was again slow in</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning to the bank after she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">glided by.

But it was not his habit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave matters to chance, and, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not cease to curse, he hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his clothes and quitted his apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The "palace" of Jogore was built,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as has been stated, some way inland,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, for purposes of privacy, out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the lagoon. To verify or re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fute the astounding statement of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling menial, Hussein had to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceed to the summit of a wooded hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the walls, where by day it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual to keep a lookout man posted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By night the precaution was dispensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with, and, indeed, such was the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence in the secrecy of the channel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the efficacy of its protection that</seg><seg type="columnLine">even by day the watchman was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed there to signal the arrival of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tulwar from her periodical trips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a stone hut under the brow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hill on the landward side, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was kept the electrical apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">for firifig the two mines at the lagoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the channel, and the hut also</seg><seg type="columnLine">served to give shelter to the watchman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This man, a swarthy Arab, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first to discover the presence of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer in the lagoon, and Hussein</seg><seg type="columnLine">found him still staring at her through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his telescope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snatching the glass from the man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hussein leveled it, and saw at a glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that what he had believed to be the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible had happened. That coal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">black vessel of three thousand tons was</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly not the smart little steamer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which Zohrab was wont to idle about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lagoon, and which was used for</seg><seg type="columnLine">importing European goods from Bom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay. There was no doubt that for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time in the history of that curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">"kingdom" the inviolate channel had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been found and safely passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Hussein's scrutiny was prolonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and told him more than that. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized the intruder as the Sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk--the steamer to which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid that nocturnal visit in the Royal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albert Dock, on the eve of her much-</seg><seg type="columnLine">advertised departure in quest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost galleon's treasure--the steamer</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose expedition he had taken a hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried voyage to Europe to prevent by</seg><seg type="columnLine">any means. As he shut the telescope</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a snap, he remembered how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had crept aboard her with a knife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for Powlett Ferrars, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled on honest Walter Lynden</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hussein Ali, though too cosmopolitan</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a strict observer of the rites of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his creed, was imbued with the true</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mahommedan fatalism, and the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of the Sea Hawk did not alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether disconcert him. It was disquiet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing certainly, but what was ordained</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be, and matters had not gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far yet that by luck or judgment--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter chiefly--he might not per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suade fate to stand him in good stead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would be time enough to accept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">decree as against him when it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">openly declared--not a moment before</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and in the meanwhile he would do</seg><seg type="columnLine">his level best to prevent that disaster.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It might be that he could twist the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advent of the Sea Hawk to his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this philosophy strong upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he bade the lookout man report</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest movement of the steamer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or, so far as they could be observed, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew, and made his way back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PLUNDER SHIP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">palace of Jogore. For the moment he</seg><seg type="columnLine">put from his mind vague speculations</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to how the steamer had safely passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contact mines in the channel, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">why she had come, and set himself face</seg><seg type="columnLine">to face with the actual fact of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence in the lagoon, and its bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon existing circumstances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These, on the whole, were not quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his liking--apart from the tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous one that had dragged him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bed two hours earlier than was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wont. He had retired to rest on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the previous night happy in the belief</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Walter Lynden had been slain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud of his victory over Maisie Sellon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied that his policy of effecting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less forced union between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zohrab and an English girl would bind</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nominal master in closer bonds than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever; and yet, as he had closed his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sleep, he had been conscious of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight uneasiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This had been due to the behavior</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Zohrab after the interview at which</seg><seg type="columnLine">consent had been wrung from Maisie</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a price of her lover's life--the lover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">be it remembered, whom Hussein be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved to be already dead. Dazed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first from the effect of the hypnotic</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure put upon him, Zohrab had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown sullen as the influence wore off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally almost rebellious. Hussein's</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasiness was due to a half doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether he would be able to keep his</seg><seg type="columnLine">"subject" up to the mark till the return</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Tulwar with some individual able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to travesty a marriage service.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time he reached the palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclosure, his active brain had ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered out of an unpromising situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">the germ of a very promising plot which</seg><seg type="columnLine">should serve two ends. The chief one</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the destruction once for all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zohrab's scruples by hurrying on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">union with Maisie; the second had ref-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erence to the final disposition of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sea Hawk. That the steamer had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew strong enough to attempt violence</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not aware, but he knew that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">magic word "treasure" must be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of her arrival, and he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention of allowing her to depart. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealously guarded secret of Jogore was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be endangered through sentiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the lives of a few seamen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On passing through the guarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">gates into the inclosure, instead of go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing indoors, he turned aside and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the quarters where the armed re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainers lived. He saw at a glance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rumor of the strange ship had pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etrated here. The men were hurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their accouterments. The air was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with a buzz of excitement, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid the crowd stalked to and fro the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sikh commander of the forces of Jo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gore. Twenty years before Mirzah</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khan had vanished mysteriously from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his regiment at Rawal Pindi, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting his colonel, and there was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big reward offered by the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">government for his capture. Zohrab's</seg><seg type="columnLine">father had had a genius for spiriting</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and turning to his own uses male-</seg><seg type="columnLine">factors who had made the mainland too</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot to hold them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing Hussein, this man came for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and saluted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is to be a fight at last, O</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hussein Ali Sahib--a fight after all</seg><seg type="columnLine">these years," he said, with a gleam in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eye. "I shall not have drilled these</seg><seg type="columnLine">rascals for nothing, after all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hussein laughed a little at the other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiasm. "It is well to be prepared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mirzah Khan; but this little surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">may, after all, be settled by subtler</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods than your strong soldier ways.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How do you account for this vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">having passed the contact mines in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">channel through the atoll? There is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging ahead for some one who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been remiss in his duty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That mongrel son of a dog, Ayoob,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who commands the Tulwar, is respon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, anyway," replied Mirzah Khan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">between whom and the chief of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"sister service" there was a long-stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing jealousy.

Nor did he allude to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">original purpose for which the steamer</seg><seg type="columnLine">had visited those seas. He affected a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jocular vein, rallied Lena on her want</seg><seg type="columnLine">of appetite, and expatiated on the su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periority of brandy and soda to coffee</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a breakfast beverage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chafing inwardly at being able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather no clew to his intentions, Wal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter fell in with his evident desire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided the forbidden subjects.

So the Kid hadn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">killed the big picture, after all!

"We're on our own feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">now ; and those feet are firmly fixed.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"They are--very!" There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer note in Jimmy Hamilton's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he stepped up behind the Carltons</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made the quiet statement that</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused Polly Nelson to turn from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gracie Heyburn and look at him. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's eyes saw new lines around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight-shut lips, there was a look in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp eyes that she couldn't quite define</seg><seg type="columnLine">--then she remembered what Gracie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heyburn had told her upstairs. His own</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife and child had been killed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quake; and here was another wife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">child that could be helped. A new side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Jimmy Hamilton, an unsuspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, but as suddenly as the lines had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to Jimmy's face, they went, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice had all the old-time business</seg><seg type="columnLine">crispness, that was softened by a smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he finished. "Come on down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office and I'll fix up those contracts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good scheme, George," he compli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented, doubling into his pocket the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">manuscript envelope that held the latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">offerings from the New York office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come on, a couple of you, for wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll all go,'' decided Gracie Hey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burn, with characteristic leadership.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll make it shot-proof and unsink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able.

They all crowded into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, littered office, and talked as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy wrote the contracts.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Polly was young in the business,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she hadn't yet learned that all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination to be used had been given</seg><seg type="columnLine">to scenario writers and directors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, run along, children," ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy, as he pulled the manuscript en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velope from his pocket.

Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, she thought he needed a bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">extra friendliness, a word to show that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she understood and sympathized, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">already he had turned to his desk. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">ivory cutter was ripping at the big en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velope, and over his eyes were the lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of concentration that came when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at a cold, typewritten sheet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper and saw moving, living charac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters live, die, love, and hate, men</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighed and found wanting; sacrifice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vengeance. His mind saw them all be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the cold black lines. Polly Nel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son stood with her hand on the knob of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open door as the others walked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and away toward quarters. She looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his bent head and hunched shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">--shoulders that seemed to droop as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he were very tired. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">something told him of her lingering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned, and a word of womanly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathy was on her lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Close the door when you go out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polly," he said sharply. "Busy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She choked back the words she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to say, with a little catch in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat, and went out, pulling the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed after her, and leaving him alone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The others were hurrying on ahead, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she made no effort to catch them. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to be alone, and to think. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">she walked the whole length of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">studio building, around its back, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the length of the other side. The happy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">members of No. I company were too</seg><seg type="columnLine">engrossed with their own affairs even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to miss her. She walked to the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the building again, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the dusty window of Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamilton's office. She knew that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see his face there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Polly Hamilton did see his face, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not the face of the Jimmy Ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilton she had known. It was drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and haggard, the chin rested in the cup</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his hands, and his eyes stared out</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight before him, unseeing, unwink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, staring into nothing--or into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of his dead wife and child, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps. Even as she watched, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged his shoulders as though to</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw off some heavy burden, his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped to the papers before him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was Jimmy Hamilton,'director, once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, planning moving pictures on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred-thousand-acre stage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Polly Nelson was very quiet that aft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernoon, or as quiet as she dared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the laughing party, without excit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing comment.

But her</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOVIE MAKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mind was on the hunched-up, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had been in the rough office</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the studio building--then this new</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble had come to Jimmy Hamilton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Polly remembered that snappish</seg><seg type="columnLine">remark when she had waited; she knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sympathy would not only be wasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">but would be resented, so she forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself to read. Naturally the Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">story interested her. She devoured</seg><seg type="columnLine">every line of it, and the last two lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the very last story she read brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">an exclamation from her lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Feature stuff!" she murmured. "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">big chance!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paper in hand, she rose and went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the porch. As she had become in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested in the stories, she had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">no count of time, and when she got out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the porch she was surprised to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the girls had gone to bed, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">only Jimmy Hamilton and Joe Bates</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained talking over their cigars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter with bed, little</seg><seg type="columnLine">one?" called Joe Bates, as she appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the doorway, and Timmy, too. looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she stood there a sudden desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to Polly Nelson to give Jimmy her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip when he was alone. Somehow, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frivolous-tongued Joe Bates didn't seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fit in the picture she had seen through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window of the director's office. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">she answered lightly as she dropped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chair:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too fine a night for bed, Joe; think</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll stay up and chat a while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was half an hour later when Polly's</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatience had almost become rage, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe yawned, and announced that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to bed. For several min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes after he went there was silence on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon-lit porch, and it was Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamilton who broke it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Raise, Polly?" he asked quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning his head to look at her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Jimmy, you're more than fair,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polly's voice, too, was quiet. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that feature stuff." She saw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes narrow, as she held up the paper</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she had folded under her arm. "Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines here look like a big chance for us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">President Carlton is going to inspect his</seg><seg type="columnLine">S. F. &amp; G. system this week, paying</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular attention to the operation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small way stations. That coop of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place down at the southeast corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranch is one of those way stations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He almost snatched the paper from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands, and there was a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardness in his voice as he said: "Let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that!" Polly hadn't an idea that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing had hit him so hard; she didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspect that anything could. He took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paper to the porch rail, and by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the moon read the lines she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had pointed out; read them, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes narrowed and lips set. "Thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">God!" he muttered, as his eyes had cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roborated Polly's statement. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to meet her curious stare. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that lie was on the verge of saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">something, but that he changed his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't overlook that bet, Polly," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared, with characteristic brusque-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, jamming the paper in his pocket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Always knew that some day I'd have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance to write a scenario of my own.</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way I wanted it. This is it! I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">write one around Carlton. It'll be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peach, too. Get to bed, now. I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded jerkily, and, hurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the steps, started in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his office. Polly watched him go, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as she could see him in the bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the moon; then she turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door with a sob that caught in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat; a sob of sympathy and under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing. She obeyed Jimmy's order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she tossed restlessly on her bed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleep would not come. After hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossing, she rose and looked out of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. The light in the window of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy's offiCe burned brightly. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">working on the scenario; what kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scenario would it be--the story of</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Carlton, junior, of his wife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby? She shook her head. It couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be that. Jimmy wouldn't dare make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">film out of that, and with John Carl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, senior, appearing personally. Fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture stuff must always make a hero of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "feature." Dawn came, the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">still burned in the office window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the breakfast table, Polly, heavy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed, saw that he showed no signs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his all night at work. He even smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerfully, though in a low-toned aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her he cautioned silence. She under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood that he did not want the Carltons</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know that there was a possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elder Carlton coming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got a fair picture," announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy, when he liad demanded a third</seg><seg type="columnLine">cup of coffee. "Called 'Outcasts.' Rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl marries a poor fellow. Her father</seg><seg type="columnLine">casts her off. By Jove!" he had appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently just got a new thought. He stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Carltons. "Why can't we put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a scene with a baby, like Dorothy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the girls found her, only adding</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unconscious husband, or, better yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have Dorothy and the baby just as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, and have the husband, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out searching for food, come back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">find them." He gazed around at them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with shining eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Polly drew in her breath sharply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was he going to work John Carlton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">senior, into that picture? He wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare! She looked around the table, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy's enthusiasm was contagious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great!" cried Gracie Heyburn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Big-time stuff with a punch!" as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">severated Joe Bates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even the Carltons, who had caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atmosphere of the big ranch in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">week they had been together on it, ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted the idea joyously. They, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to see only "pictures" and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">making of films as the day's work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had come to "sense a situation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine!" they chorused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you know little Johnnie gets a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred for every picture he gets in!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy Hamilton smiled. "There's two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred to his credit now. That des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ert stuff drew a bonus."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thanks of the Carltons were al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most pathetic, and for the instant that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the others' attention was on Dor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">othy and her husband, Polly again</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought she saw the tight little lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Jimmy Hamilton's mouth. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were gone again instantly, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought she must have been mistaken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can have another day off." de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared Jimmy, when they rose from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. "Pm going to look over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground for 'sets' to-day, and to-morrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll start in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately the No. i members be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan planning an all-day picnic. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very few days when one or more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them didn't work. Polly Nelson took</seg><seg type="columnLine">no interest in the plans. Her mind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere else. When she got an op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity she strolled out on the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch in time to see Jimmy in his auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobile scoot off in the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad tracks and the small telegraph</seg><seg type="columnLine">way station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her brow puckered in puzzlement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something on Jimmy Ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilton's mind that no picture had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">put there before. Was he going to risk</seg><seg type="columnLine">his position merely for a chance to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feature on President Carlton ? But</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mind refused to entertain it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy was square. He was hurt, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">justly so, at his relegation to second or</seg><seg type="columnLine">third place by the officials of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany, but he still had bis common sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell him what the pictures of Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent Carlton on a moving-picture film</seg><seg type="columnLine">would mean. Of course, if it could go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it would make the younger</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carltons known all over the country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the baby a household word. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby! To her mind again flashed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture of the hunched-up man at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk, whose eyes apparently stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. Would he sacrifice everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put the Carltons on the road to fame</seg><seg type="columnLine">and money for the sake of the mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">and child--and the memory of a mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">and child that had been taken away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him?</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOVIE MAKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">119</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They bore Polly away to the picnic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, but all through the day her mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on Jimmy Hamilton and the pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture he had spoken of. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion in the minds of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">players; no suspicion because Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had failed to mention "Outcasts" when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had spoken of the batch of scripts</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had come from New York. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a "fair" picture, Jimmy had said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that was all that concerned any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night, Polly got Jimmy aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked the question, and he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered it with a slow shake of his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it seemed a long while after when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Polly," he said quietly. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't their story." Polly raised her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly to peer into his, for she had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected a shade of peculiar emphasis on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "their." But his eyes met hers</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily, with no flicker of expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell what he had meant or whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been right, after all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day began the work of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new picture. Once more Dorothy Carl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton proved that she was a natural mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion-picture actress, just as two or three</seg><seg type="columnLine">other women have proved it to skep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical film directors throughout the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try, for several of the best leading mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion-picture actors and actresses never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had any experience on the stage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it wasn't all natural acting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorothy's case. Once more the clever</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy Hamilton had given her a part</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had really lived; that she knew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In life, and in great acting, the heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the prompter for expression, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the early scenes of "Outcasts,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorothy Carlton's face only had to obey</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dictates of her heart, that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned so bitter a lesson. John Carl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton needed experience, and needed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly. He was stiff and constrained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaccustomed to playing parts before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clicking camera that would show</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on the films in a thousand cities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His wife's work carried him through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the first scenes, and as time went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted him out of himself, just as it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted other actors out of themselves in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "big picture."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the first two days of rehearsing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and playing. Polly Nelson saw nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable in the scenes of the scenario</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy Hamilton had written. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were commonplace enough, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that Jimmy was breaking the se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quence of the scenes even more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">location and setting of the various parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ranch required. Moreover, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual snappy haste was missing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">work went through in a leisurely man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. and would have made the Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamilton that Polly had known throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the seven fits of rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the third day, the mail was due at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town, and Polly volunteered to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">after it. Her young brain was sorely</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled, and she wanted quiet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">straighten out its kinks. She rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, there was no hurry, and tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to figure out in her mind the feature</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff that Jimmy Hamilton was holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">back for. Something was in the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his shrewd head. She knew it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every time he looked at Dorothy Carl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton. or John, or the baby, Polly sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised that curious look in his eyes; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">look that Polly could not fathom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She rode down toward the tracks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the natural amphitheater two</seg><seg type="columnLine">small hills made, through the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorge that had been the scene of a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred moving-picture holdups, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">it curved sharply, and hid from view</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything that might be coming down it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and also the railroad tracks a few hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet farther on. She always went</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way because she always had a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">words with the hopeless old derelict</seg><seg type="columnLine">who watched over the way station and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telegraph key.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She didn't have to hail him this time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was standing out on the rotten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarded platform, and began to talk as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as she got within sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's a telegraft that just came fer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at	...	......</seg><seg type="columnLine">120</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mister Hamilton." By the time he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished that sentence, Polly had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought her galloping pony to a dust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising stop beside him. "The owl man</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be here about half past two in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon to-morra," he volun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teered, with no thought of breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">State and national laws regarding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanctity of telegrams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The old man ?" puzzled Polly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrusting the envelope into the bosom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her waist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. The prisident, owld Carl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To-morrow?" gasped Polly. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course she had known that he was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, but the shock of explicit informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and the nearness of the crisis took</seg><seg type="columnLine">her by surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certain'y !" The aged telegrapher,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who sought peace and quiet in loneli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, winked up at her with owlish</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisdom. "Don't be tryin' to fool me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Didn't Mister Hamilton wire him</seg><seg type="columnLine">t'other day that his son and daughter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in-law and baby was all here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He did that?" The words came</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly from Polly's lips, and she sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly felt numb all over as her whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world turned topsy-turvy. Jimmy Ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilton had told Carlton, senior, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young Carltons had hidden them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves.

Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamilton a traitor to the people he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretending to help! But it couldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible--the picture there at the desk;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then she remembered the eye narrow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, the grim lines around the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor's mouth, the curious looks she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised in his eyes whenever they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were turned on the Carltons. So it</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't been all imagination. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been true. But why? Why? Why?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She took the mail bag without both-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering to answer the greetings as usual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and galloped full speed back toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch. She went the way she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, for she wanted to speak again</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the old telegraph operator. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">had she gone away so quickly ? He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been about to say something else, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps shed a different light on the thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polly Nelson didn't want to think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy Hamilton was anything but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man she had respected for so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks; the man who had shown a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wonderfully human side in the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">few days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she had no chance to speak with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man. She saw Jimmy Ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilton's car, and she saw him and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ranch's moving-picture-machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">men carefully looking over the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the station. He saw her com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and walked rapidly toward her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "O'Brien give you a message for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me?" he asked curtly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Polly handed it to him, but her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were looking down at the pommel of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her saddle, and her lips were tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">compressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Told you all about it, I suppose,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, ripping the flap open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked up then.

That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the God of gods, the Deity of Empy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rean. "Don't spoil the film" had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinned into her ears as the greatest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all laws.

All the authority</seg><seg type="columnLine">over ten thousand men on his railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">system was in President Carlton's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he made that demand of his son.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stretched forth a hand to grasp him</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell him to go to the devil, John!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy Hamilton's crisp voice broke in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tone as it always was when he is-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sued a direction.

"See that</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine there!" He pointed a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. "You were too full of your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrath to see or hear it, weren't you ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Know what it is?

Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">camera caught your train, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">alighting. They're howling for feature</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff back East, Carlton, and I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps a couple of our news-interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">camera men caught you in Frisco and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the way.

"No! It isn't black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mail, Carlton!" Jimmy's voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse, low, so they had to strain their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears to catch the words. "I'll tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of this moving-picture story.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's called 'Outcasts.'

In-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">side, the hall would be cheerfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted--the stairway, too, and his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">suite on the floor above--and the ''night</seg><seg type="columnLine">man" would be moving about, making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemn circuit of the many rooms. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the outside, the place looked un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterably cold, lonely, and unhomelike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Knox admitted this to himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he fumbled for his keys--admitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as he had admitted it innumerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">times before. For--perhaps--the thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandth time, he was wondering what</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world lie could do about it, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he became aware that he was not alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the broad vestibule. Some one--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in evening clothes--had advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiselessly from behind the ornamental</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxwood in the corner, and he wore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">black silk mask over the upper part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his face. Also, he had a revolver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was leveled directly at Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knox's heart--or so it seemed to Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knox.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His dark eyes opened wide with curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">NOCTURNAL ADVENTURES OF MR. NICHOLAS KNOX 141</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">osity and interest--brightened with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement. He was conscious of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrill that had stirred him in years. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">burglar! A masked burglar, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, in his own vestibule--exactly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">block and a half from the weary po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liceman on fixed post--and only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet from the night man on duty some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where within 1 Mr. Knox instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot his fatigue, his inevitable bore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom, his satiation. His heart began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat actively. His blood began to flow</seg><seg type="columnLine">more quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How d'you do?" he said pleasantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning a bit so that he faced the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly. "Fine night for a murder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eh ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The burglar seemed for just an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant a bit astonished. However, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedily recovered himself, and an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered grimly, in a voice that was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite steady:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This isn't a joke. I'm in dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest, and this gun is loaded. I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no compunction about shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Really?" asked Mr. Knox, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take your hand out of your pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and don't attempt to call for aid. Inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dentally, I am a crack shot!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shouldn't think of calling for aid,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered Mr. Knox frankly. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be too bad to spoil such an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting situation. Seriously, you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned a dull and stupid evening into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-letter night. What can I do for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The highwayman--evidently never</seg><seg type="columnLine">having met with such a reception under</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar circumstances--was silent an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant, studying his victim in the dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. Then he responded curtly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I want money, of course. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">much have you about you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Knox reflected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, a hundred or so, perhaps."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A hundred?" repeated the burglar</seg><seg type="columnLine">in astonishment and disgust and disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointment. "A hundred dollars?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"About that, probably. I usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry somewhere in that neighborhood."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The burglar was silent. Mr. Knox</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited an instant, peering regretfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the other man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Isn't it enough?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not nearly," answered the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. "I might have known you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have much more with you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But I- Haven't you any checks?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not here.

If you'll come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing in his voice but</seg><seg type="columnLine">polite invitation. The burglar laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly, his amusement conquering his</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointment. Mr. Knox laughed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Would that be destroying the ethics</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your profession ?" he asked. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare say it would. Or do you suspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">me of attempting to lead you into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The idea would never have occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me," answered the gentlemanly high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wayman sarcastically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Knox sighed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I suppose the natural thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be for me to snare you--or try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to. But, on my word, I'd no such in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention. I was thinking that I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend an hour or two pleasantly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your company. I suffer from insom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nia, you see, and I get sick of books</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chess. My man sometimes plays</seg><seg type="columnLine">chess with me, and there's nothing else</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but solitaire. I was thinking that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, comfortable chat with you might</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep me amused until my bedtime.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How much money were you expecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take from me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I need twenty-five thousand dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars," answered the burglar slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've got to raise that much before</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twenty-five thousand ! Is that your</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual night's haul ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," answered the burglar mod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">estly, with the hint of laughter in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice; "no, not my usual night's haul</seg><seg type="columnLine">142</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly.

"I'm afraid I haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">that much in cash in the house. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evef, if you'd take my check, or some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">odds and ends of silver or jewelry-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Would that do at all?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't make me laugh!" begged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highwayman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Still fearful of treachery? That</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't complimentary, you know, consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering that I've given my word."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your word to a highwayman isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">very binding, especially when he has the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'drop' on you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put down the gun, then, and I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">give you my word voluntarily. You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">still have the advantage of me. Phys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ically, you're bigger and more mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cular."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The highwayman apparently thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that over. Then he put down his gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. If there had been more light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have been seen to look a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazed by this turn of things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," said Mr. Knox cheerfully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"here's a sporting proposition for you:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come in with me, and we'll have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink and a little chat. You shall be</seg><seg type="columnLine">my guest for an hour or so, entitled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the courtesies of my hospitality.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then you are to be free to go, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my check for twenty-five thousand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I give you my word--I'll do it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing, if you like--that the check will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be stopped, neither will I attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to seek you out and reclaim the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">or punish you! How's that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You aren't serious?" gasped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highwayman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I am. On my honor! Why, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrill you've given me to-night and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entertainment I expect from your con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation are well worth twenty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars to me. I've so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">money that twenty-five thousand dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars has absolutely no value to me. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrills! Surprises! Good stories! In-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting philosophy! Ideas! Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, those things are invaluable! Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The burglar hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, come! My word of honor</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll stand by my bargain," went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knox. "I simply can't miss this op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity of conversing with a real,</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuine, honest-to-goodness burglar!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The burglar sighed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I'm not a regular burglar," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted. "I've never attempted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">burgle before to-night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No? Then you are a man of cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age and nerve, anyway--and of ideas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there must be a story behind your</seg><seg type="columnLine">little flyer in crime. Come in! Burglar</seg><seg type="columnLine">or no burglar, my offer holds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well," agreed the near-high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wayman finally. "I'D take you up !"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Knox breathed a little sigh of</seg><seg type="columnLine">content, thrust his hand deep into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket, found his latchkey, and opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy, brass-trimmed door. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperado, still in his black silk mask,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carrying his gun, followed his host</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the big, gorgeously furnished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliantly lighted foyer hall. The night</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, a huge fellow, ruddy-faced, sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a big armchair by the grate, smoking</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pipe and reading the newspaper. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose in haste--at the sight of his mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter--and stood aghast before his mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter's companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Evening, Rogers," said Knox ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sently. "Are there lights in the study?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, sir," said Rogers, his eyes go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wildly from Knox to the masked</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Trained as he was to express as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonishment at nothing, this visitor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost too much for him. Besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were the paper and the pipe to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain and ask pardon for. "Mr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Knox, sir-" he began, wetting his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some of that French brandy, Rog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, in the study." said Knox, interrupt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. "Unless you prefer a cocktail--</seg><seg type="columnLine">or--something else?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned politely to his guest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">NOCTURNAL ADVENTURES OF MR. NICHOLAS KNOX 143</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The brandy sounds inviting," an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered the masked man, nodding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At once, Rogers," ordered Knox.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he added to his visitor: "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">way!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They mounted the great staircase to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor above. There Mr. Knox</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned left, and threw open the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his study. A low tire burned here</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the grate, too. to battle with the chill</seg><seg type="columnLine">and damp of the early spring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will find this chair most com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable," said Mr. Knox, indicating a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge-armed one. "Throw your hat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat anywhere, and make yourself at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. I'll just change for a lounge</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat, if you don't mind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He passed through a second door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way into his bedchamber, and closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door behind him. The burglar, left</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone so unceremoniously, glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him, listened, shrugged, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped his revolver into the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket of his light topcoat. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed the coat, threw it upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">couch, put his hat with it, and, remov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his mask, added that. He stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed, now, a man of perhaps twen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty-six or so, exceedingly well molded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and distinctly handsome. He was fair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had blue eyes, but his features were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather rough-hewn, and his skin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanned. He suggested the out-of-door</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, the man who is engaged in "do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing," rather than in directing and plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning; but he wore his formal clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one who had been born to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. Sinking into the big chair that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knox had indicated, he drew out a cig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arette case. It was of gold, and ini-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tials were done on it in platinum--B.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A. Selecting a cigarette, he lighted it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put the case back into his waist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat pocket, as Knox came back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is infinitely better," he com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented, with satisfaction, as bis eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell upon his guest. He had changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dress coat for a Tuxedo jacket of</seg><seg type="columnLine">royal purple stuff edged with cardinal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the colors emphasized his darkness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--skin ivory and pallid, eyes and hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">very black. He had lighted a cigarette,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, but he smoked it through a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, ivory-and-gold cigarette holder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seating himself opposite the unmasked</seg><seg type="columnLine">highwayman, he observed critically : "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not mistaken in my guess.

Then Mr. Knox conducted Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aimes to the head of the stairs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched Rogers let him out below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The erstwhile thief strode content-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly down Fifty-seventh Street to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenue, and down the avenue for two</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks, at which point he mounted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps of the Aimes residence. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nicholas Knox entered his bedcham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, and, with the aid of his valet, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bed. For the first time in a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of years, he fell asleep at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Knox awoke at one o'clock upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following afternoon.

And by the time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had completed his afternoon toilet, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in splendid appetite for his break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, or luncheon, or whatever you</seg><seg type="columnLine">might choose to call his first meal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day. That afternoon there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only two teas and one reception, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he felt called upon to appear, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had time to stop at the bank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cash a check, getting five thousand dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars in notes and gold. This, against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening's adventure. Then he drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the park, picking up Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phillip Ladew and Miss Ladew, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had promised the night before, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signedly began his afternoon rounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By six o'clock he was free, and, hurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing home, he changed in good time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Aimes, as it happened, was late.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, Mr. Knox had just begun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder if the whole thing had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">NOCTURNAL ADVENTURES OF MR.

If ever there lived a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">keenly alive young man than Mr. L5ige-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low Aimes, Mr. Knox had never seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.

The huge table was set</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gold plate and fine china, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">decorated with American Beauties.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aimes, staring about him, grinned ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preciatively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Reminds me of the 'Arabian</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nights,' " he observed.

Or, better</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, keep this for headquarters, anti</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll open a flat on the side.

It's only just begun !" prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised Aimes. "We'll pick out an apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment to-morrow, and furnish it and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stall servants.

Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, he remained in the dining</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, and an under servant made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trips. Consequently, Mr. Aimes talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about South Sea Islanders, his luck at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monte Carlo, and the stupidity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">London cabmen, until the coffee and</seg><seg type="columnLine">liqueurs had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Aimes had come at a quarter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight, instead of at seven, as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed.

There was a safe, too, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pat Crogan, in gilt letters, on it; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a second doorway, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded by any gate.

This completed the fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nishings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two men and a woman were already</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, waiting. The woman looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Syrian peddler, and she carried a suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">case similar to the ones they use for</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding their linens and spangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">shawls. She had the dull, listless face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vapid eyes of ignorance; but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">her turn came, when genial Crogan</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the door to escort her in, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformation occurred. She became,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an instant, a very eagle of a woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewdness, wisdom, ingenuity gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in her face. The two men would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been taken for crooks anywhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had the low foreheads, the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row, close-set eyes, the ape jaws of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crime; and there was in their bearing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain uneasiness that revealed an ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">present, secret fear. The Syrian ped-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dler woman was with Crogan half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour or more, coming forth without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suit case.

Then he ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached Neece, Knox, and Aimes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You gentlemen together?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Neece.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You want to see me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," answered Neece, producing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pawn check.

He rose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and moved toward the safe. Throwing</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the great doors, he searched for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the number on the ticket in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For some time he searched, going over</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless tickets, while Knox, Aimes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Neece looked at one another nerv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously and waited.

Then she'll tell Duke that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewels turned up--that they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">mislaid merely, and that will end the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But will it?" asked Aime.

She'll tell him that she put</seg><seg type="columnLine">them into the wrong case by mistake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that finding the right case empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had raised the cry of thieves, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the time they were there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Admitting, then, that he believes</seg><seg type="columnLine">her," went on Aimes, "what will you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do? You've no money left to take you</seg><seg type="columnLine">West, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neece hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll find something to do around</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," he replied. "1 can find something</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do, surely. I'll change my name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and take anything that offers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll send you West," volunteered Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knox.

His face lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it had not since the three had met.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes shone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It used to be my ambition to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowboy when I was a kid," he said. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never thought I should be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They drew up before a little hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">on West Forty-seventh Street and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended. Knox paid off the taxi. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bill was something short of twenty dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars. Then Neece left word at the desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a woman inquiring for him was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sent up directly to his sitting room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the three of them ascended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a typical hotel sitting room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was just enough furniture to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vide necessities. Draperies, carpets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures, had been ordered by the doz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ens, and looked that way. A great</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch of roses that Mrs. Duke had sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, thrust into a water pitcher, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of other vessel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not very elegant," said Mr. Neece,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he switched on the lights and closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door behind him, "but a palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside of what I've had these past</seg><seg type="columnLine">few years.

I hope so," said Neece</seg><seg type="columnLine">somberly. He looked older as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts dwelt upon the subject. Bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter memories quickened to life, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aimes, watching him, felt the necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an interruption.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Smoke?" he asked, producing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigarette case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neece hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It should be my place to play host,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "but 1 have little to offer you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing worthy of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You could offer me nothing to equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own brand," smiled Aimes.

There's nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an English cigarette, in my esti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Knox and Neece joined him, and Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aimes struck a match, from which all</seg><seg type="columnLine">three drew fire. As he tossed away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned-out stick, the telephone rang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neece was across the room in an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant, answering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello?" he called. . . .

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he moved toward the door and opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">it slightly, waiting there for the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">to appear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your sister trusts her absolutely?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Aimes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. She's had her for a long time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost since she married."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aimes shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"It just occurred to me that here is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big enough temptation to appeal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost any one.

And then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked out of the half-open door, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift door clanged, and called: "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, Nina!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The woman who entered a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later was short, thin, meek looking, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Englishwoman obviously, of incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">insignificance. She had an ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and an ordinary figure, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore an ordinary black dress and black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat. There was nothing distinctive</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her, nothing individual. Hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of her kind are serving the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try all over the world, as their moth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers served before them and as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughters will serve in future. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd, she would have gone her way</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseen, undisturbed. Aimes, studying</seg><seg type="columnLine">her keenly, was forced to admit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing about her to distrust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Here is a package, Nina," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neece, "that you are to take back di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly to Mrs. Duke.

Nina advanced toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, which Neece threw open for her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she did not depart, for the sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple reason that she could not. The way</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still barred by two gentlemen, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, apparently, been in the act of en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering. One of them was short and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stout, with a protruding paunch in front.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was dressed in brown, and carried a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown bowler in his hand. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">freckled, green-eyed, and red-haired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other man was bigger, and had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">black mustache. He was frowning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both men, finding the door so con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veniently opened, walked in, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowning dark man closed it behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Nina had retreated, still hugging</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jewel case. Neece, Aimes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knox were staring, taken completely by</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise.	'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a minute, miss," said the red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired man suavely.

Marty had been pitching for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eagles for nine years, and for a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of seasons sporting cartoonists had pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured him, with white locks and a cane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hobbling into the box. He was exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty years old, according to the rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ords in the family Bible, but in league</seg><seg type="columnLine">baseball he was a veteran of veterans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not a man on the team now playing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a regular had been with the club when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marty pitched his first game. Pie was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one survivor of Manager Pat Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan's first championship nine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up to the middle of September, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that year, Marty had pitched twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five games for the Eagles. Of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had won seventeen, and six of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight he had lost had been decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him in April and May. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring had been cold and rainy, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">veteran pitcher like Esmond needs</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear, hot days to be at his best; a hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun to bake out his muscles. Young</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitchers do well enough in arctic</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather; the old-timers dread the days</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the stands are sparsely filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivering fans in overcoats and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coachers at first and third wrap them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves warmly in sweaters or macki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It looked, in the first weeks of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">172</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">season, as if Esmond was going back;</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if be had about come to the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his usefulness as an Eagle pitcher. For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately, however, for the team's stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the race, appearances were mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading. With the coming of real</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather, in June, he -began to pitch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly, as well as ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was a different sort of pitch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. For the last three seasons Esmond</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been changing his method in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, and now the change was complete.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He no longer relied at all on speed; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast ball, when he pitched it at all, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed in simply to baffle the batters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He depended now on his control, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ability to make the ball break as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased, to cut the corners. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eagles bad a safe lead he served up</seg><seg type="columnLine">balls that were easy to hit, trusting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fielders to cut off hard drives; set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tling down to pitch only when there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were men on bases and there was a real</seg><seg type="columnLine">and absolute necessity for him to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pat Dugan knew that Esmond was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going back; Charley Greene, now his</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular catcher, knew it. But no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">except himself knew the agony that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esmond endured during and after every</seg><seg type="columnLine">game; the shooting pains that did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappear from upper-arm and shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles for several hours after the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball was pitched, despite the expert min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istrations of Sam Jackson, the prince</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rubbers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every day, before he pitched, Marty</seg><seg type="columnLine">submitted himself to Sam, and the mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles of arm and shoulder were rubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kneaded until they were soft and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pliable. But they tightened up under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strain of actual pitching, and every</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, as Sam pounded and rubbed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kneaded and pulled, Marty swore that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing would induce him to go through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pain and torment again. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, even as he made that resolution,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would keep on, just as he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this was his last season. The stiff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening that would come in the long win-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ter meant the end. The hot days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Texas spring had rejuvenated him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the last time; next year he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to pitch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, when this season was over, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to quit, and his one purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">now was to help the Eagles into an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other world's series.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't ambition alone that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marty so keen to get into one more</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's series. Of course he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wind up his career on the diamond</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a blaze of that sort of glory, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than the glory he wanted--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed--the extra money. Even a los-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing share of world's series receipts</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant a check for about two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars; a winner's share might be half</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much again. It was on that check,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which hadn't yet been earned, that Es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mond had to depend for a new start</seg><seg type="columnLine">in life. He hadn't saved a cent; hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to. ./</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Except for the anxiety he felt as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his future, Esmond took the inevi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table and inexorably approaching end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his career as an Eagle calmly enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wasn't sorry for himself. Ball play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, as a rule, know about bow long they</seg><seg type="columnLine">may expect to remain in fast company.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are sorry to leave it; they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry to see friends slow up and go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the minors. But they don't regard such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things as tragic, certain authors to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrary notwithstanding. Most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, nowadays, have a comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">nest egg laid up for the days when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to leave the bench, and a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">many spend their winters building up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a business that they can step into when</seg><seg type="columnLine">their playing days are over. Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">improvident ones can, as a rule, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pend upon from two to five extra years</seg><seg type="columnLine">in good minor leagues, where the pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">is smaller, but is still big enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give them time to get ready for other</seg><seg type="columnLine">work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Esmond, unfortunately, wasn't so</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">confided to Esmond and one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">others that he was losing a lot of sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the bench, he was like a wild man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Errors that were made with the hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could forgive; slow thinking, wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking, resulting in what ball play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers call a bone-head play, drove him</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lashed his.young players unmer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cifully with his tongue when they went</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong. He had to, as he saw it. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">come into the stretch, with a chance for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pennant, they had to play just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little bit better than they knew how,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only Dugan knew how much de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended on their success. Let them win,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this year, and they would be confident,</seg><seg type="columnLine">irresistible for two or three more sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons; but if they lost, they would lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a pennant--they would lose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew, the chance to be transformed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a squad of promising players into</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of those great baseball machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stand out in the history of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The youngsters on the team didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind the abuse. They were dazzled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glamour of actually being in a real</seg><seg type="columnLine">pennant fight. But Marty Esmond had</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much at stake, in his way, as Dugan</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. His nerves were just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched and taut as Dugan's own, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the manager called him down pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">licly for mistakes in pitching, mistakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were due to the imperative neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sity of saving his arm, Esmond grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot and sullen. In ordinary times, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dugan liked one another; but these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not ordinary times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, with less than a week of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">race left, the climax came. Both the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kite? and the Eagles were playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the season against second-division</seg><seg type="columnLine">teams. If both clubs won all their</seg><seg type="columnLine">games the Eagles would win the pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant by a single half game. The stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing then would be: Eagles, won, 97;</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost, 56; pc., .634. Kites, won, 97; lost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">57; pc., .630. There was a postponed</seg><seg type="columnLine">game that the Eagles couldn't play off;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but if the Eagles lost one of the half</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen games that remained, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kites won all of theirs, the Kites would</seg><seg type="columnLine">win the pennant, for the percentage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Eagles would drop to .627.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every game counted; none was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">important than another. But it hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened that circumstances gave a ficti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tious importance to a Saturday affair in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Marty Esmond pitched. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands were packed. Even the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tail-end Reds were playing couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the crowds away at such a crisis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Reds turned loose a young pitcher</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was the sensation of the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">league, one Schultz, who had joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Reds too late to improve their stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. but was full of promise for suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeding years. He had beaten every</seg><seg type="columnLine">team in the league. The last time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eagles had faced him they had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hits and no runs. In the first in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, errors behind Schultz gave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eagles a run. Marty realized that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was strictly up to him to protect that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead, since the chances were all against</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more scoring off Schultz.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, for eight innings, he bent all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunning, all his deep knowledge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">art of pitching, to the task. Inning</seg><seg type="columnLine">after inning the Eagles went up, swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wildly at the fancy shoots and daz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zling speed of Schultz. Inning after</seg><seg type="columnLine">inning, too, the Reds, though they hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esmond hard, though they had men on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bases almost every time, tried vainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get the hit that would drive home</seg><seg type="columnLine">a run or two. In the pinch, Marty baf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fled them every time. He worked a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">174</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slant change of pace when there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">men on the bases. At all other times</seg><seg type="columnLine">he let them hit the ball, depending on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fielding stars who backed him up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This much he could do; he could de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termine almost exactly where the ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be hit, and whenever he pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straight ball he turned deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave the signal to Keohan, the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond baseman, who, in turn, signaled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other fielders to shift, and cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">the threatened spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thanks to Marty's strategy, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">score, when the Eagles took the fieid for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ninth inning, was still one to noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Three more outs, and the game</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be won. The Eagles would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to face Schultz again this season;</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other pitcher they might have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet would begin to be so dangerous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, in the ninth inning, every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing went wrong. The first man up</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit to Keohan. The ball, coming easily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a bad bounce, and shot over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder for a lucky single. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">man sacrificed; Burns, on first base,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming in for a quick play at second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw just too late to get the runner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and both men were safe. The third</seg><seg type="columnLine">batter, swinging wildly, trying to knock</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ball out of the park, topped it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the demon of bad luck turned the hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">into one of those slow-rolling, sneaky</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounders that are impossible to field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three men raced for it together; by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time Keohan got it the bases were</seg><seg type="columnLine">full, with none out!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anything would tie the score now--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long fly, a short single. Marty grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Keohan as he took the ball, walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly back to the box, and stared con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">templatively at Hammond, the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">batter, who crouched menacingly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate. He had pitched hard that day;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder was on fire with quick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbing pains that shot up through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his neck to the back of his head. Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan, on the bench, stared at him ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pealingly. Then, with three pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">balls, Marty struck Hammond out,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">while the crowd raised a pjean of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. Again he paused, and then was</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled by another cry from the crowd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a welling shout, made up of derision</seg><seg type="columnLine">and delight. He turned and looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scoreboard, to see a great five posted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Terriers in their game with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kites--in the ninth inning! He smiled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and relaxed. The Kites had lost; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant that the Eagles could drop this</seg><seg type="columnLine">game and still have a chance. But then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he looked, the score for the Kites</seg><seg type="columnLine">went up--a staring six, token of a rally</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had won the game for them, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pitched to the next batter. Ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">one! Again; another ball. He tried a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve. Ball three! The ball had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused to break. The pain in his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der had redoubled in intensity; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to him that he could not pitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">another ball. Dugan came running out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marty welcomed the respite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've got to give him curves," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugan tensely. "Even if you walk him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't let him hit it! If he walks, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">force in a run; but we've still got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to keep the score tied. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">let him hit it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more Marty pitched. This time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he curved the ball. His shoulder mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles shrieked as he achieved the task.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strike one! Then he knew, suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could pitch no more curves. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must depend on the team behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At his signal, Greene came out anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't help it,'' growled Marty. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to give him a fast one on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside. He ought to hit it to Keohan</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a double play.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Straight and true the ball flew for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate. The batter lunged forward; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball, a white streak, cut the grass a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond Keohan's outstretched fingers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A clean hit to center! Two runs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ! Dugan, raving like a madman, tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the diamond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get off the field!" he screamed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marty. "You threw the game--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">MARTY ESMOND'S ARM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">175</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pennant, most likely. What's the mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter--you got money up on the Kites ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another pitcher came in. He retired</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Reds with one more run, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mischief was done. Marty had not fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished dressing when the Eagles, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couraged, disgusted, sullen in defeat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured into the clubhouse, without hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing been able even to get a man to first</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their half of the ninth. And there</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and Dugan growled and spat at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another like two angry cats, Dugan full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of anger at Marty's disobedience, ^Es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mond resenting Dugan's insinuation</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all the strength that was in him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He might have guessed that it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a hasty taunt; that Dugan himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">had probably forgotten it by now. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words rankled, left him furious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as, without waiting for Jackson's rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, he made his way to the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Marty had told Dugan the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his arm there would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">no trouble; but he couldn't bring him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to do that, somehow. Even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew that his pitching days were</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, he still hoped against hope that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter's rest might work some miracle;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the spring would see him restored</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some measure of his former ability.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was foolish, no doubt, but certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was human.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night he paid for his neglect to</seg><seg type="columnLine">submit to Sam Jackson's rubbing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain in his arm and shoulder kept him</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake. In the morning it was not much</seg><seg type="columnLine">better. He went to a doctor who knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, of course, and didn't try to hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">his surprise and interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be frank, Mr. Esmond," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It doesn't look very good. It may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">neuritis--it may be just a temporary</seg><seg type="columnLine">affection of the muscles. I'd prescribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">a complete rest, electrical treatment--</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps mud baths and such things at</seg><seg type="columnLine">some spa. Oh, you needn't shake your</seg><seg type="columnLine">head! I'm not going to prescribe at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. I'm going to do something highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">unprofessional--send you to an osteo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">path. I don't say he can cure you, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he ll help the pain, and he can't do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">any harm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Osteopath, eh?" said Marty. &lt;'Ilow</seg><seg type="columnLine">much will he soak me, doc?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you care?" asked Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emerson quickly; too quickly, if Marty</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been in a noticing mood. "We all</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the sort of salaries you fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">get."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, well 1" Marty flushed. "I'm no</seg><seg type="columnLine">pauper, exactly, but a lot of that talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">about big salaries is bunk, doc. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't want to believe everything those</seg><seg type="columnLine">baseball reporters write."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, don't worry," advised Emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. "Kammer won't charge you too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much; and it'll be worth it. Give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">this card."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Esmond had just happened to visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emerson. He knew no doctors, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">the club physician, and he had purposely</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided him. Emerson's sign was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first he saw after he left his hotel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had controlled his choice. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor, he thought, would do as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as another. Had he asked for an opin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion as to Emerson from those qualified</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give it, he would have heard nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the doctor's professional skill;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he might have heard some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories about him that were current, sto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ries of his rather lurid outbreaks amid</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white lights of the city; of his inti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">macy with certain gamblers. Probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">this would have made no difference,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however. Marty might have felt, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">justly, that Emerson could act as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased, without affecting his ability to</seg><seg type="columnLine">heal a sore arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doctor Kammer, the osteopath, diag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosed the trouble with Marty's arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must not pitch again this sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son," he said. "If you do--that will</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost certainly be the end. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest now, and submit to treatment, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have an arm next spring as good</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was five years ago. I do not think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will, but you may; and it is certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you can then do some pitching. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">176</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">if you abuse your arm any more now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you subject it to any great strain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you may have very serious trouble--</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble so serious that you will not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to write, to do the most ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilings which arms are for. Now I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">give you a treatment that will relieve</seg><seg type="columnLine">your pain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marty left Kammer's office in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtful mood. He took little stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the suggestion that he might be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pitch another season or so. No mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter what doctors said, down in the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom of his heart he knew. But about</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking a rest now? He would almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly be called on for one more</seg><seg type="columnLine">game, and, if the Kites happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose another game, and so let the Eagles</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the world's series, after all, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would pitch one game at least of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big series. The way his arm felt now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could do it, too. Why couldn't he</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a treatment from Kammer every</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, and take the chance?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Relief from pain helped his mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude. He worried less about the fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. Something would turn up. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lots of friends; he ought to land</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good job, even without the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's series check to tide him over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He decided to spend the rest of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunday in the country. He wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget baseball for a while, anyhow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he came back, he dropped off</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trolley car outside his hotel. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't intend to go in, though it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unofficial headquarters of the Eagles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But three Eagles, spying him, rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, slapped him on the back, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged him into the lobby. There a</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting of jubilation was in full prog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ress, with ball players, fans, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sundry taking part. The incred-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible had come to pass. The Kites had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped two games of a double-header</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Sunday afternoon, in their home</seg><seg type="columnLine">town in the West. They had cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the strain. The disaster was due,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might well be, to overconfidence, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result of the Eagles' defeat of the pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vious day. Now the Eagles had their</seg><seg type="columnLine">margin again; they could even afford</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lose another game, and still win the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pennant. For the first time in weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pat Dugan was smiling. He greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esmond jovially.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello- there, Marty, old boy!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Some news, what? Say! For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get that panning 1 handed you yester-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. It was pretty raw, but I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean a word of it, really."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Marty was not to be so easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeased. His look was still sullen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess you meant it, right enough,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">be said; "and I guess you'd still be</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning it if the Kites had won those</seg><seg type="columnLine">games to-day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dugan looked black for a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chase yourself off to bed, Marty,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie said. "You're tired, old boy. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it easy. I'll save you this week--</seg><seg type="columnLine">so you'll be right for the big series.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll be depending on you for that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marty went off, glowering. So far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could know, his meeting with Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emerson, just outside of the hotel, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result of pure chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, how's the arm? Kammer fix</seg><seg type="columnLine">it up?" asked the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure! Feels great!" said Esmond</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, I heard about the roasting you</seg><seg type="columnLine">got yesterday," Emerson continued. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed his arm through Marty's in</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly fashion. "Rough stuff, that!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Use you all up, and then pan you when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were suffering torture every time</seg><seg type="columnLine">you threw a ball!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sympathetic note got an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">response from Marty. He was just in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mood to be confidential. He liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his associates on the team well enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was a survivor of an older gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eration. These youngsters had their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own friendships, naturally. He had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">his intimates in the past, and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered now. Some were in the mi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nors ; some had quit the game alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">MARTY ESMOND'S ARM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">177</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. There was no one to whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could unburden himself. Consequently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he quite realized what he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing, he was telling Emerson every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gad! That's tough--it certainly is!''</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the doctor. "I guess we outsiders</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to thinking you ball players all have</seg><seg type="columnLine">it easy. But who'd ever think a club</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the Eagles would treat you so?</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'd turn you off next spring, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, if your arm was gone?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, sure ! Why not ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They ought to do something for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. You've made thousands for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">club. Why, it's because of you that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're practically sure to get into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's series. How about the series?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who'll win it ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will--on the dope," said Esmond</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly. "The odds'll be on us, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm good for one winning game, young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bentley ought to win twice, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the staff can pull us through</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, among the lot of them. The Her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ons win in their league because they</seg><seg type="columnLine">got so far ahead at the start no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">could catch them. But they've gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad the last few weeks. Their pitch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers arc on the bum, and Spike Mallo</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with a broken leg."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right," said Emerson thought-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. "I heard the betting would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">about three to one on the Eagles. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance for a clean-up--if they lost."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't you worry any about our los-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing," said Esmond. "If we beat out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kites, we should worry about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herons! They're not in our class--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the way they've been shot to pieces."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I suppose not, but just the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's no law against thinking about</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a clean-up there could be if any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one fixed it for the Eagles to lose, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their eyes met, and in that moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esmond began to understand. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them said anything, but the pitcher's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were the first to fall. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">now what was in Emerson's mind, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw a way to end his diamond career</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a small fortune, instead of just</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to give him a start. After all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the receipts, his share of a world's se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ries, could not be figured in advance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bad weather, any one of a dozen rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons, might cut down attendance. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought was planted in his mind, at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">events.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw Kammer," said Emerson, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming irrelevance. "He says he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you not to pitch again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's all he knows," said Esmond.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've got to get in on that series."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But suppose your arm went bad dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a game? That might happen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure--it might!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Emerson was wise. He said nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. They parted. But Marty was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not suq&gt;rised when he learned from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk of the hotel, in answer to his dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creet questions, that Emerson numbered</seg><seg type="columnLine">among his patients some of the biggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">gamblers in town, including one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had tried to start a nation-wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">weekly pool on the standing of the big-</seg><seg type="columnLine">league clubs, a scheme that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken up by the National Commission,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which knew that the taint of gambling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">once it affected baseball, would kill the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game, as it had killed horse-racing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost every State in the Union.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the middle of that week the Kites</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped another game, and the Eagles</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinched the pennant, even if they lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of their contests. At once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's series talk dominated the city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a good deal of betting, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small way. The odds, as Emerson</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard they would, favored the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eagles. They had passed successfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">through their great crisis, and the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensus of expert opinion favored them</seg><seg type="columnLine">now over the Herons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dugan, the pennant once won, became</seg><seg type="columnLine">his normal, genial self. He did every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he could to encourage his team</seg><seg type="columnLine">of youngsters. He wanted them to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the Herons full of confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">178</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in themselves, convinced that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbeatable. The result, as a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, did not greatly worry him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected his team to win, but he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could accept defeat with equa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nimity, provided they made a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing. This, of course, before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first game. After the series had once</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun he would be after victory ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer and tongs. That was Dugan. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">conldn't let up once the fight was on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Marty Esmond, he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day for the first game approaching with</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingled, uncertain feelings. His own</seg><seg type="columnLine">injuries, as he saw them, dominated</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Emerson had worked skillfully on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feelings. He couldn't forget Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan's accusation. He had done his best,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as a reward, bad been publicly ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cused of throwing a game. If he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be suspected, why shouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">he get something out of it? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldn't he feather his own nest, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had the chance? The club to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had given the best years of his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the loyalty of nine years--to which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally, he had sacrificed his greatest as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set, his pitching arm, would cast him</seg><seg type="columnLine">off without a thought as soon as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could no longer serve it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Emerson knew that Marty would</seg><seg type="columnLine">think along those lines. He met him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly by accident, every evening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the day before the first game of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great series he struck home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A lot of my friends are lined up,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "They've got this series doped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. It's going to run to six or seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">games. You'll pitch the deciding game,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they know you're with us, they'll put</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a lot of money. Tf they win, there'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be five thousand in it for you. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can pitch good, winning ball in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">game. That'll only lengthen the odds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How would I be sure of getting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money?" asked Marty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It'll be put in a safe-deposit box.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the Eagles lose, you can get the key</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Tim Casey. You know him. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">held a good many hundred thousands of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars in stakes. He'll never squeal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either. What do you say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were in front of Esmond's ho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tel, and at that moment the demon of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mischance sent Pat Dugan by on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side of the street. He saw Es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mond, and came over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a minute, Marty," he said. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">led him away. "What's the matter with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ?" he asked. "Are you plumb</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy, letting yourself be seen with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crook? He's mixed up with gamblers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, if some of the newspaper boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw you with him, they'd swear you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rigging up a plant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeh ; an' I suppose they'd remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you said to me 011 the field 1"</seg><seg type="columnLine">flamed Marty.

Then the teams jumped West,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and broke even again in the Heron</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronghold. But, despite the closeness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fight, the attendance in those first</seg><seg type="columnLine">four games was disappointing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herons came from a small city, that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, in any case, a good baseball town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and threatening weather had kept a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of people away. Marty scowled as be</seg><seg type="columnLine">read the receipts. The winners' share</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be less than twenty-five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars apiece, for it is in the receipts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the first four games only that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">players share.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back East went the teams. The Her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ons won the fifth game. Another jump.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Eagles tied up the series. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a seventh game necessary, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the toss of a coin brought it to the home</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Eagles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He won't let me pitch--he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only stringing me," thought Esmond to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. But in the train, on the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, Dugan told him quietly that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">depended upon him. The newspapers</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced that he was to pitch. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning of the last game, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had finished dressing, Emerson</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked at his door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, it's up to you," he said. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole roll's down on the Herons."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Get out!" growled Marty. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">needn't remind me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rest of nearly two weeks, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant treatments by Kammer, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his arm feel as good as new; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that morning, when he went to the os-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teopath for a final treatment, Kammer</seg><seg type="columnLine">scowled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you going to pitch?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Marty nodded. "Well, it'll spoil all I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">done for you. You'll be lucky if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can finish the game." He went into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reasons for what he said. Marty</seg><seg type="columnLine">got some vague notion of certain liga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and tendons, still too weak to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear the strain of pitching. He only</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled. They would furnish a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">alibi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He warmed up easily before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game, just tossing the ball. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to pitch, with an ease, a freedom</seg><seg type="columnLine">from effort, he had not known all sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. Ferber, the Heron star, opposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He had won two games already,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutting the Eagles out in one and al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing a single run in the second. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was young, as big as all outdoors, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly without a nerve in his body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For six innings he and Marty indulged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in as pretty a pitching duel as the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabid enthusiast could ask for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll let 'em get a run--that'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough," thought Marty. "We'll never</seg><seg type="columnLine">score on this bird."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the seventh, Marty himself, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was proverbial for bis weak batting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even among pitchers, swung wildly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of Ferber's shoots, and lifted it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right-field stand for the fiukiest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">home runs. The whole team slapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on the back, grasped his hand, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came to the bench, and the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">went mad. But Marty saw Emerson</seg><seg type="columnLine">scowling from a box right behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eagle bench. He dared not recognize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor, but surely any one must</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what an accidental hit that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the eighth inning his arm began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to trouble him. He stopped curving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball and sent it up straight. But, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringing drives left the Herons' bats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marty's fielders performed prodigies</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him. Two hits went safe, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Keohan, with two men on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bases, flew over toward third, speared</seg><seg type="columnLine">a screaming liner, dropped back on sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond for the second out, and shot the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball to first in time for a triple play.</seg><seg type="columnLine">180</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was sheer robbery. Carson, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit the ball, had been entitled to a three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bagger, perhaps a home run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got a horseshoe in that glove?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Dugan, when Marty went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why don't you send Bergman in, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you don't like the way I'm pitching?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped Marty. Bergman had spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon in center field, tossing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few balls now and then, to be ready in</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of need. But Dugan said nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, only stared hard at Marty, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the water cooler for a drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the ninth inning. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd was roaring. Marty turned, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went to the box, and caught a glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Emerson's strained, white face. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the last chance. His arm was sore</seg><seg type="columnLine">now; constant twinges warned him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kammer had been right. In about two</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes he changed the whole aspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the game. He passed the first man;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next bunted, and Marty messed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the simple task of throwing him out, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that two men were on the bases. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to catch the man on first, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw low to Burns, and both runners</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced. That spoiled the chance for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a double play. On the next ball pitched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keohan, getting a slow ball, held it so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long to keep the man on third from</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoring that the bases were full.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take him out!" roared the crowd in</seg><seg type="columnLine">unison, and from the bench came Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan, beckoning to Marty. They met</seg><seg type="columnLine">just off the diamond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Marty, I'm on to you," said Dugan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're trying to throw this game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've done it--because you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bergman isn't good enough to stop 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the bases full. He's no good after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man gets on. You're the only man</seg><seg type="columnLine">we've got that can still win this</seg><seg type="columnLine">game-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My arm," began Marty. Dugan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm, pitying tone upset him; he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluster, somehow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know," said Dugan. "Marty--</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're going to stay in. I'm going to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trust to you--to the man that's been my</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief reliance for nine years. I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell you something you haven't known</seg><seg type="columnLine">--or any of the boys. This is my last</seg><seg type="columnLine">game in uniform. I'm through to-day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've started to throw this game--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I'm going to trust to you to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and be the white man you've al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways been before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned away quickly and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the bench.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pat!" called Marty. "Pat-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got no answer. Dazed, wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, he went back and faced the batter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the howling mob in the stands. Dugan</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted him! And, all at once, the enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mity of what he had agreed to do, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness of his treachery, came over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He knew he couldn't do it. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">those nine years of loyalty to Dugan, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great game, swept over him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">set his teeth. Dugan was right. He,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he alone, could still save the day--</seg><seg type="columnLine">if his arm lasted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he began to pitch. Not for three</seg><seg type="columnLine">years had he used such speed, such con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">summate skill. The first batter watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">three balls cut the corners of the plate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was out on strikes. For the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond, remembering his weakness, Marty</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched a drop, a ball that involved an</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful tearing of his shoulder muscles;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he had his reward. The batter</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck, lost the ball on the drop, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent it straight up in the air, to fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Greene's big mitt for the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now great beads of sweat stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on Marty's forehead. For a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment the pain in his shoulder made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">dizzy, so that black spots danced before</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes. One man to get, and his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going. It was the crisis of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kammer had warned him. The nails</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his left hand bit into the flesh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew blood. He shot over a swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike, seeing the batter out of position.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a curve, a wide, sweeping ball,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that broke and came in after the batter</seg><seg type="columnLine">had decided to let it pass. Two strikes</seg><seg type="columnLine">MARTY ESMOND'S ARM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">181</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--two out. He was in agony. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">one ball left, his old fast ball, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast rise; but he had not used it since</seg><seg type="columnLine">early in July; even then the strain had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been too much. To pitch it now meant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew, the breaking of those over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained ligaments. But then, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base runners all started, he pitched it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The batter swung--missed it by a foot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The game was over--the Eagles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">champions of the world, but Marty Es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mond's arm bung, numb and useless, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The club doctor lifted it in the club-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house--looked grave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll be able to use it--but not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitch," he said. "You finished it in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">last inning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind," said Dugan crisply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Marty, come here!" He took him</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside. "Marty, I was onto that business</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Emerson. But--I knew you. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">made good. Marty. I'm quitting to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">president of the club. I've bought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock.

Ye see, when we was all children,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little thing took such a fancy for</seg><seg type="columnLine">both of us that we couldn't help likin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">her for it, and so we became, in course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time, like big brothers to her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come down on the shore with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill an' me an' sit quiet all the day an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">never say a word or do anything to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noy us or put us out. Sometimes we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">go out sailin', an' then she would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' sit beside whoever was steerin' till</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd ask her to come up an' sit on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee. Then she'd put up her little arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">round his neck an' kiss him, an' would</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay as quiet as a mouse till she'd have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to change her place. That was the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir, that we both came to be so fond</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An', sure enough, when she began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow up, Bill an' me wanted none other</seg><seg type="columnLine">but her. An' the more she grew, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prouder we were of her, till at last we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out that we were both of us in</seg><seg type="columnLine">love with her. But we never told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, or let her see it; an' she had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">up so among us that she never suspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. She said so long after.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Bill an' me held a kind of coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cil about what was to be done, an' so</seg><seg type="columnLine">we came to be talkin' on the bridge that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Mary was growin' into a young</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, an' we feared that some other</seg><seg type="columnLine">chap might take her fancy, if one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us didn't get her at once. Bill was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious, far more serious than me. for</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had somehow got the idea into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head as how Mary cared for me, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">as long as I felt that I couldn't feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">either unhappy or downhearted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All at once Bill's face grew brighter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' there was a soft look in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Joe," he says, "whatever happens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary must never hang her head. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lass is tender-hearted, and she likes</seg><seg type="columnLine">both of us, we know; an' as she can</seg><seg type="columnLine">only love one of us, it might pain her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that when she was marryin' one</seg><seg type="columnLine">man she was leavin' a hole in the life of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his comrade. So she must never know</seg><seg type="columnLine">as how we both love her, if we can pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we got that far, I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow uneasy.

Why won't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> you go, or why not draw lots ?" I've</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> had a many hard tussles in my time,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> both with men an' things, but I never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> had such a struggle as I had to say</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> them words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Joe," says Bill, "you must do all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> you can to win her yourself, an' don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> let any thoughts of me hinder you. I'll</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> be best pleased by seein' her an' you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> happy, if so be she loves you." Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he stood up from leaning on the rail,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> an' says he:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Joe, give me your hand before we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> go, an' mind, I charge you on your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> honor as a man. never while I'm livin',</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to let Mary know as how I loved her,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> in case she chooses you." So I prom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ised. I felt Bill's hand grip like a vise,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> an' then we turned an' walked away</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> home an' never spoke another word</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that night, either of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I didn't sleep much that night, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> when it began to get to mornin' I got</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> - up an' went down to the sea an' had a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> swim, an' that freshened me up some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> what. I wasn't much of a swimmer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> myself, but I could manage to keep</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> myself up pretty well. That was the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> point where I envied Bill most of all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was the finest swimmer I ever see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did a many things well, an' no lad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> in this county could come near him in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> anything he chose to do; but in swim-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> min' none could come anigh him at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An' many's the time it stood to others</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as well as himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Well, when I had had my bathe, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> went up toward Mary's home, an'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> found myself goin' in to ask her straight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> off to marry me. Then I began to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> think it was too early for Mary to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> up; so I stole away on tiptoe, an' walked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> round the house. Then I thought I'd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> go an' look up Bill, an' came anigh his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">house. But when I came to the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I didn't like to knock, I thought I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">speer in, an' see if he was asleep. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stole to (he window an' looked in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I never shall forget to my dyin' day</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I saw then. I wasn't a bad fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, thank God, at any time, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't be a bad fellow or do anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought very wrong after that. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Bill, just as I had left him the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. He had never changed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes, an' the candle was flickerin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in the socket, unheeded. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">kneeliu' down by the bed, with his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched out before him, an' his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the quilt. That was thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven year ago, but it seems like yes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terday. I thought at first he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepin', but I saw from a movement he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made that he was awake. So I stole</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, guiltylike, an' went down an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood beside the sea. I took off my hat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' let the wind blow about my fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, for somehow it felt burnin', an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 looked out over the sea for long.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somehow my hgart beat like as if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lead, an' I felt half choked. 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">dunno how long I would have stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">there only for Bill. He came behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and put his hand on my shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said, sudden :	*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Joe, what are you doin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">here ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned, startled, an' saw that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was smilin'. I was so thunderstruck</seg><seg type="columnLine">at seein' the change, that for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said nothin'. He says to me again:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Joe, I thought you'd have more to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do than think of eatin' this mornin', an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's bad to court on an empty stomach !</seg><seg type="columnLine">So come up to my place; I've got break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast for the both of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I couldn't realize that this hearty</seg><seg type="columnLine">chap was the man I saw prayin' after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long night. I looked at him keenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blit could see no sign of his actin' a</seg><seg type="columnLine">part in his face. He was gayer an' live-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lier than ever, an' in such good spirits</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he made me gay, too. I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget how Fd seen him a short while</seg><seg type="columnLine">184</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">since; but I laid the thought by, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't let it trouble me. I went up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his place. It was clean an' tidy as ever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' the breakfast was ready. He made</seg><seg type="columnLine">me eat some, an' when I was done, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushed me up an' tidied me, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">says be:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go in an' win, old lad. God bless</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye!" I went away toward Mary's</seg><seg type="columnLine">house; but before I lost sight of Bill, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, an' he waved his hand to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a kind smile an' went in an' shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went on toward Mary's; but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther I went the slower I got. An'</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I got to the garden gate I stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether. I stayed moonin' about</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for a whiler till at last Mary sees</seg><seg type="columnLine">me an' comes out. I don't know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell you what took place then. I ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">more bashfuller than a man of my years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to be, but somehow it comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough on a man to tell this kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Oh, no; it ain't that I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember it all; for I do, well. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye see--ye won't laugh at me? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know'd ye wouldn't; I ax yer pardon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, to prove it to ye, I'll say what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never said yet to mortal, except Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">--an' that only once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mary comes out to me, runnin' like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little girl, with her face all dimplin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">over with pleasure, an' she says:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Joe, what brings you here at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this hour? Come in, Joe! Mother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">here's Joe! Have you had your break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, Joe? Come in!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt that I would never have cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age to speak out before her mother if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went into the cottage, so I stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the gate an' let her talk on. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked at her then, I could hardly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve what I was come for; it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like doin' something wrong to try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">change her from what she was. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked so lovely an' so bright that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed a pity ever to wish her to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">aught else--even my own wife. An',</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside, the thought came an' hit me</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard, that mayhap she wouldn't have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me, after all. I tried to think on that;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but. Lor' bless ye, I couldn't. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">somethin' so terrible that I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it. However, I stood still, sayin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothin', till she began to notice. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't used to be sheepish before Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">or any one else; so when she had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">her talkin' she looked at me sudden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' then her eyes fell, an', after a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, she blushed up to the roots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hair an' says:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Joe, what's the matter with you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You don't look as usual."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I blurted out all in a moment:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Mary; nor I ain't the same as</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual, for I'm in trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She came close to me before J. could</seg><seg type="columnLine">say any more--she wasn't lookin' down</seg><seg type="columnLine">or blushin' then--an' she says:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Joe, I'm sorry for that." An'</seg><seg type="columnLine">she put her arm on my shoulder. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she went on, in a kind o' tender voice:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did you tell Bill?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," I says.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what did he say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He told me to come to you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To me, Joe?" she says, an' looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," I says, in despair like. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">in trouble, Mary, for I want you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Joe!" she says, an' drew away</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little. Then she says to me, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer look on her face:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Joe, run an' tell Bill I want to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">him--to come as soon as he can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, them words went through me</seg><seg type="columnLine">like so many knives, an' if ever I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have hated Bill, it would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">then.' What could she want Bill for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 thinks to myself, but to find out if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he loves her, too--an' to have him? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinks how mad a woman would be to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have me when she could get a man like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill. I was afraid to say anything, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">set off smart for him, for I feared I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be able to tell him if I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">go at once. I tried not to think while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was goin' down the road; but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't get her words out of my head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">GREATER LOVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">185</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They seemed to keep time with my feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' I heard them over an' over again:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tell--Bill--I--want--to--see--him !</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tell--Bill--I--want--to--see--him !"</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last I got to the house, an' found</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill inside, mendin' a net that hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">agin' the wall. He turned round quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I came in, an' his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to beat so hard that I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">it thumpin' inside his guernsey. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw I wasn't lookin' pleased, so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came near an' put his two hands on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders an' looked me in the face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''What cheer, Joe?" he says, an' I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that he was tryin' to control</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. When I told him the message,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began tremblin' all over, an' got as</seg><seg type="columnLine">white as a sheet. Then he says to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a thick kind o' voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Joe, how did she look when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried to tell him, an' asked him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a minute," says he, an' went into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he came back I turned round,</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectin' to see him got up a bit; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there he was just as he went in, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">old workin' clothes. But he was quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookin', an' had a smile on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bill, old lad," I says, "aren't ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' to tidy up a bit? Mayhap Mary'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to see ye neat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he says; "I'll go as I am. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">it be as it may be, she won't like me</seg><seg type="columnLine">none the worse for coinin' quick; an' if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it don't be- Come on, Joe, an' don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">keep her waitin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, we walked up the road without</seg><seg type="columnLine">sayin' a word. When we came in sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mary's cottage it seemed darker to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me than it had been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mary came out of the gate to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, an' when she spoke to Bill 1 dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind. They two went into the arbor</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had built for her. They sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">talkin' for a few minutes--I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">them through the hedge--an' at last I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Bill bend down his head an' kiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. She put her arms round his neck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an' kissed him. An' at that the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the light seemed to go out of the sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' I wished I "was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I would have gone away, but I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly stir. I leaned up against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hedge, an' didn't mind any more till I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Bill's voice callin' me. I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in at the gate, puttin' on as good a face</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I could, an' came into the arbor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill an' Mary was standin' up, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill's face looked beamin', while Mary's</seg><seg type="columnLine">was red as a rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill beckoned me over, an' when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came near, he says:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Mary, shall I tell him now?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, Bill," she says, in a kind of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper; so he says to me:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Joe, I give her to you! She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't let none do it but me; for she</seg><seg type="columnLine">says she loves me like as a brother.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Take her, Joe, an' love her well, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">God bless ye both !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put her in my arms, an' she clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was bewildered, an' could hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">see; but when I came to look about</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was Mary in my arms, with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face buried in my breast, an' her arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">round my neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill was makin' down the road, up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right an' steady as ever. Even then, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, I couldn't think of Mary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my thoughts went back to when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Bill kneelin' beside his bed, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms stretched out, an' I felt--if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll believe me--more sorrow than</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy. I know now that Bill had wrestled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the devil that night, an' threw him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if ever a man did. Poor Bill! Poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 suppose I needn't tell you what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary an' me said? It wouldn't sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">much, at any rate, altho' it pleased us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I felt that she loved me I forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">even Bill, an' we was happier than</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue could tell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, the time went on for a month</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two, an' we was thinkin' of gettin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">married soon. I was gettin' my cottage</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready an' spendin' some of the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">186</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I had saved to make it bright for Mary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill worked with me early an' late, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wasn't only his time that he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. He would often go into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town to buy the things I wanted, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm sure he never got them for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told me. I said nothin', for I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would only hurt him, an' it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">little enough that I could do for Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let him help if he chose. I used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch him to see if be wasn't unhappy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I never seed a sign of sorrow on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He always looked happy an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright, an' he worked harder than ever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' was kinder to all around him. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he didn't forget--for how could</seg><seg type="columnLine">he forget Mary?--an' I feared at times</seg><seg type="columnLine">lest he might fret in secret. But I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seed him grieve. I could hardly imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ine, when I would think on it, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary came to take me or love me when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill was nigh her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, the time wasn't long goin' by,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for we was happy, an' had all our lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us, an', at length, the day came</seg><seg type="columnLine">round before we was to be married. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Easter Sunday we was to be mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried on, an' all the people as knew Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' me--an' that was all the village--</seg><seg type="columnLine">was goin' to have a grand holiday. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to go an' have a feast out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island, an' we was gettin' the boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaned an' nice an' smart for the occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. In coorse, everybody had to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own dinners; but we was to join</seg><seg type="columnLine">them all together an' make a grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feast. We had got a cask o' beer, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">we was to have great doin's an' a dance</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the grass. There's the finest sod</seg><seg type="columnLine">for dancin' in the countryside out yon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der on the island, an' we'd got Mike</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wheeler to bring his fiddle, with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">extra set of strings. We weren't to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come home till evenin', when the tide</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, an' then we would have a race</seg><seg type="columnLine">home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, Bill an' me, we both took tea</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Mary's house that evenin', an' when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we came home Bill asked me to go into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his house for a while an' have a quiet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">talk. We lit our pipes, drew up our</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs, an' sat down by the fire an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed away, without sayin' a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some time, an' then Bill says to me:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, Joe, there won't be a man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the church to-morrow that won't envy</seg><seg type="columnLine">you--except myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought of him kneelin' down by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bedside that mornin' when he says</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, so I thought to tell him. I put</seg><seg type="columnLine">down piy pipe an' came an' put my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms on his shoulder, as I used to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we was boys together, an' told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him all I knew. He just shook hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me, an' says he:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Joe, it was a hard fight, but, thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">God, I won! I've crushed out all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old love now. Why, lad, to-morrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">she'll be your wife, an I'll care for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more than any other woman--as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetheart, I mean, for I'm a brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her now as long as we live--an' to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Joe. It ain't that I think less of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, for I'd walk into the fire for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">this minute, but--I can't explain it, Joe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You know what 1 mean."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bill," I says, "you've been a true</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend to me an' Mary, an' I hope we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">always be able to show how much we</seg><seg type="columnLine">both love you. May God judge me</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard when I die if ever I have a hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of you as long as I live!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We said no more after that. I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, but came back in a minute to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill to be sure to come an' wake me if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was up first; but when I was passin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window I see him hangin' a coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">up over it. It wasn't that he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd spy on him again that he did that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that in his face; but he feared I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might see him again somehow, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might pain me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, I woke in the mornin' as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was daylight, an' went down an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a swim, an' then came home an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushed my new clothes an' laid out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt that Mary had worked for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself, an' washed as white as snow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Bill came down to me. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take his breakfast with me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">GREATER LOVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">187</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mornin', an' he came all dressed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weddin' in a new suit of clothes. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a real handsome, fine fellow at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, but he looked like a gentleman</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mornin'. Then I thought that Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have done right to choose a la-</seg><seg type="columnLine">borin' man like me rather than a chap</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Bill, that was above all of us, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept in his heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We went off to the church an' waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">till Mary an' her mother came. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people was there outside the porch, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the gentlefolks was inside. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">squire's family was in their pew, for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye see, Mary was a favorite with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, an' they came early to church to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see her married. I felt very solemn</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, but I could hardly feel as how</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary was goin' to marry me. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was, as lovely as an angel, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">blushin' like a rose. I said my "I will"</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a low voice, for it seemed awkward</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me to say it loud; but Mary said</seg><seg type="columnLine">hers out in a clear, sweet voice, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the parson blessed us, an' spoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us so solemn that we both cried, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary nestled up close to me. When it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to kiss the bride, Bill was first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' claimed the kiss, so the other lads</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to give up. Bill bent down an' took</seg><seg type="columnLine">her pretty face between his two hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' kissed her on the forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Agin the weddin' was over, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for service, so we all went to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">seats--an' I never felt solemner in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life than I did then; nor did Mary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the service was over we all</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out; an' the people stood by on</seg><seg type="columnLine">both sides to let Mary an' me walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the churchyard together an' go</seg><seg type="columnLine">first out of the gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We all went down to the beach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the boats was ready on the shore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of them was freshly painted, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple had bright ribbons tied about</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Bill's boat wa's the one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary an' me was to go in, an' Bill him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self was to pull stroke oak in her. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had got for a crew three of the young</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows we knew best, an' who was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracks at rowin', an' we was determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to race all the other boats to the island.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lads had all run on before us, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we came down to the beach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boats was all ready, an' the baskets</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the dinner put in them, so we all</seg><seg type="columnLine">got on board, an' off we started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mary an' me, we held the rudder to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, an' Bill an' his lads bent to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">oars, an' away we flew, an' in a quarter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an hour came to the island, leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others by a hundred yards. We all</seg><seg type="columnLine">got out, an' the lads carried up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baskets to the slope up yonder, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see the moonlight shine on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island, where there was a fine, level</seg><seg type="columnLine">place on the edge of the cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The grass there was short an' as</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth as a table; an' when you stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the edge of the cliff the water was</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight below you, for the rock went</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer some forty feet. Mary an' me</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there on the edge while the lads</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' the girls got ready the feast, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they wouldn't let us put hand to any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing; an' we looked at the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurryin' by under us. The tide had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, an' the water was runnin' like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mill race down away past the island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' runnin' straight away for the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">off there as far as you can see. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">currents is very contrary here, so you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">better not get caught in them when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're sailin' or swimmin'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We all sat down, an' if we didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoy our dinner, all of us, it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer thing; an' after dinner was over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girls insisted on havin' a dance. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">got the things all cleared off an' danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">away for some time, an' then some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed blind man's buff. One young</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow was blinded, an' we all stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">round; an' then the fun began. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">young chap--Mark Somers by name--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to make wild rushes to try an' get</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one, an' then the girls yelled out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' they all scurried away as quick as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could, an' the fun grew greater an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater. At last he made a dive over</seg><seg type="columnLine">188</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to the place where Mary was standin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the brink of the cliff. We all</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled to her to take care where she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was goin'; but I suppose she thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely our fun, for she laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' screamed out like the others--an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped backward. Before any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stop her, she went over the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cliff an' disappeared. I was sif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin' up on a rock, an' when I saw her</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall over the edge I gave a cry that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have heard a mile away an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped down an' ran across the grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a better man than me was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me. Bill had pulled off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket an' kicked off his shoes, an' was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the edge before me. Before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped, he cried out:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Joe, run for the boats, quick 1 I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep her up till you come. I can swim</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger nor you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't wait a second, but ran down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to where the boats was drawn up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach. Some of the chaps came</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me as hard as they could run, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">we shoved down the nearest boat. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of all our efforts--an' we was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so mad with excitement that not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us but had the strength of ten--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">took us a couple of minutes to get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair on the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, when we was fair started I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled so hard that I broke my oar, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had to stop to get another; an' then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had to row all the way round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spur of the rocks out there before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could even see whereabout Mary an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill should be. The men an' women</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rocks -screamed out to us an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed in their direction, an' the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew along at every stroke. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current was mortal strong, an' they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been for nigh five minutes in the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we caught sight of them. An'</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed to me to be years before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">came anigh them at all. Mary was</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighed down with her clothes, an' Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his; an', in spite of what a swim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer I knew Bill was, I feared lest we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should come too late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last we began to close on them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see over my shoulder as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowed. I could only see Mary's face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that was beacon enough for me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to one of the men to slip into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my place an' row, an' he did. an' I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the bows. There was Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her face all white an' her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, as if she was dead; her hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all draggin' in the water, an' as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current rolled her along, her dress</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved as if it was some strange fish</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the water. I could see nothin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bill; but I hadn't need to think, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew that where Mary was there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill somewhere anigh to her. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">we came nearer I saw where Bill was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Look here, he was down under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, an' with his last breath he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">keepin' her afloat till we came. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his two hands rise up out of the water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holdin' her up by the hair; but that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. Many's the time since then that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of all I loved Mary, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to be cross with her--for we</seg><seg type="columnLine">laborin' men is only rough folk, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, an' we have a deal o' hardship to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear at times. But whenever I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to say a hard word, or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think hard of her, them two hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bill's seemed to rise up between me</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' her, and I could no more think or</seg><seg type="columnLine">say a hard word than I could stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet an' see another man strike her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An' I wouldn't be like for to do that!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, we took them into the boat an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">came home. Mary recovered, for she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had only had the shock of her fall; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we took in Bill, it was only-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He kept his word that he spoke to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night; he gave up his life for hers!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'll see that on his tomb in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">churchyard that we all put up to him :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Greater Love Hath No Man Than</seg><seg type="columnLine">This: That a Man Shall Give Up His Life</seg><seg type="columnLine">For His Friend."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There's no more left like Bill.

A clump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush, looking out upon the northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspect of the mountain and the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of the pass, and not more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five feet from the stony pinna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cle, accommodated him.

The faintest pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible wreath of gray smoke curled from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tumbled-down chimney. "Camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers," thought Nat, later reflecting that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this conjecture seemed improbable, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">deciding that it would be imprudent, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time, to make any further investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The twilights are long in the San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juan highlands, and Nat, awaiting dusk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'</seg><seg type="columnLine">192	PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for what seemed an interminable time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied himself in reviewing, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">every possible angle, his plan to capture</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kennedy gang, concluding satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torily that they were almost certain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprehending the majority and scatter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the remainder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ella, as night came on, unable to oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupy herself with any of her usual tasks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to pace nervously about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. Finally she threw a shawl about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her shoulders and walked out upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch deck of her father's fish trap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bosquith, his throat swathed in several</seg><seg type="columnLine">folds of bandage, a rifle in his hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just emerged from the watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">shanty, preparatory to taking up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightly vigil.

Several times, as if dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traught, Ella turned and focused her</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze upon the mountain top, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose clear and distinct from the deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows which enshrouded its base.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bosquith seized her hand. She with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew it angrily, and turned as if to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the house. He resumed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleading, and she paused to listen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. Then, reaching forth, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasped his fingers. A second later she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was running rapidly to the house. ' Bos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quith entered his tiny cabin, threw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle of clothing into a dory which</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay bumping against the piling, wrote</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly a note, which he pinned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shanty door, then climbed into the craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rowed swiftly along the shore to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north. Ella, in almost the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, her slender form hidden be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the folds of her father's tar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paulin coat, emerged from the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying a small lantern. Fearlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">she turned into the darkness of a path</seg><seg type="columnLine">that led away also to the northward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nat, busy with the speculations w'hich</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually traversed his mind, became</seg><seg type="columnLine">more alertly watchful as the darkness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">deepened. Unhappy misgivings with</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard to Ella and Bosquith continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">to obtrude themselves, however, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">were suddenly dismissed when a sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming faintly from below, struck upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hearing. Then a stone, loosened</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the trail, went tumbling noisily</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the mountainside; a branch</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched back into place; a scrambling</seg><seg type="columnLine">footstep followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strained his eyes toward the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the trail emerged from the brush.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More rocks went tumbling. Twigs</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracked. Footsteps drew nearer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer. Whoever it was, was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">on at a rapid pace, with a fine disregard</seg><seg type="columnLine">for caution, and making no effort at</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealment. "So much the better,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought Nat. "My presence, very evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently, is not suspected."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt in the armhole of his vest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he always carried his handcuffs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see that they were safe, and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped the flap to the holster which</seg><seg type="columnLine">held his automatic pistol. "I'll just</seg><seg type="columnLine">handcuff you to a tree, my friend,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he communed, apostrophizing his ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching visitor, "then I'll set off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal flash, after which you and I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">march down the mountain, with you in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Nat uttered a half-sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed exclamation.

Then followed a body clothed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rough garb of a fisherman. Came</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a second, a third, a fourth, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifth, the last a gigantic, shambling crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, hands hanging almost to the knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil, pig eyes searching the mountain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side suspiciously, without a doubt was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dread Cultus Kennedy himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There had been a hitch in the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gram ; something had gone wrong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Young Baker promptly dismissed any</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of employing the handcuffs; in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TURN OF THE TIDE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">193</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stead, slipping the automatic from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster and snapping the safety down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the firing notch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four of the pirates stopped at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the monolith which comprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">the actual summit of the mountain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the leader, growling peevishly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed to the top.

Not until that moment did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sense to the full the fate that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him. In a few moments, piti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully few, he must meet his supreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony.

Pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly, he thought, if he could contrive</seg><seg type="columnLine">to loosen the thongs ever so little, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be able to hold his mouth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose above water until the tide began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn. Finally the pain of lacerated</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh, actually bringing surcease to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more poignant mental agony, he man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to tear one arm partly free.

Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the brackish water entered his nos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trils.

A quarter of a mile astern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and coming on at a rapid rate, were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights of another craft, the identity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, in the darkness, Baker could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">determine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly the landing was made.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">look was one of fondness. It was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambition to establish a large, modern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scientific poultry farm run on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">profitable basis.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">such an establishment cost money, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, and money was the one means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of barter that Joe had not.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable, he thought, that the fish were</seg><seg type="columnLine">biting like the devil--or some other rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonably good excuse for putting off a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry, Hank," said Joe, follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing this line of reasoning, "but I'm too</seg><seg type="columnLine">blamed busy to get away this morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, that's all right," answered Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">num brightly, as he pulled off his driv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gloves and fished for a cigarette.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm not going to interfere with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">work this morning. I'm here on busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness; in fact--I might as well get it</seg><seg type="columnLine">A GRAVE SITUATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21 I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">over with at once--I came to tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I'm going out of the hen industry."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The announcement did not surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe any. He had expected it to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">at some time or other. Nevertheless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he experienced a slight pang of envy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe had been of material aid to Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">num when that impetuous person had</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposed of a whole trainload of hogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take up the business of making hens</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay. He had chosen most of the equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment for his friend, and superintended</seg><seg type="columnLine">its installation. When complete, it em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">braced all of the ideas Joe entertained</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his own place, if his means ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted. Now that the equipment</seg><seg type="columnLine">was for sale, he bemoaned the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was unable to buy it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," repeated Barnum, "I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to raise Airesdales--dogs, you know--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'm going to let you have the poul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try layout, hens and all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe jumped. It was too good to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">true. He held out his hand impetu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can have it," Barnum went on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"for eight hundred dollars--cash."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe's face lost its smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why cash?" he demanded, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown. "You infernal hog, you've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">more money than Coal Oil Johnny!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, have I ?" Barnum wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. "Well, you have another guess,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my son. At the present time I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay my hands on five hundred dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could rightfully call my own. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast amount of wealth you allude to is</seg><seg type="columnLine">held in trust, dammit, and it's doled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in semioccasional spoonfuls. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing due for several months, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I simply must have eight hundred im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately, if not sooner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why?" demanded Joe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why? Because," explained Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">num impatiently, "that New York dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancier refuses to talk business with me</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless I can scare up three thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars. He fails to be impressed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my line of credit. You see," said he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking from his pockets a mass of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">literature appertaining to that breed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dogs known as Airedales, fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeming with the words "sired" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"dammed," "there's money in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, sure," interrupted Joe some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what sharply, "I know; but what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to know is, why can't you let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">have that poultry equipment of yours</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a note, say, for three months, six</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, or a year?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing doing on the time, Joe!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered Barnum positively. "Jenkins</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have cash for his pups, so I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have cash for my hens. Why," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed suddenly, "you could raise</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight hundred on this jewel of a farm</seg><seg type="columnLine">without an effort!" Joe laughed rue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Unfortunately." said he, "there's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little parasite on this 'jewel of a farm'</seg><seg type="columnLine">already--1 inherited it. But," he added</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopefully, "perhaps I could raise the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money in some other way. Will you</seg><seg type="columnLine">give me an option?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barnum considered this carefully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It might be arranged," said he. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">option for the dogs is only for a month,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know." He smiled, and eyed Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewdly. "Fred Rand has made me</seg><seg type="columnLine">an offer," he observed. Joe started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll give you twenty dollars for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">two weeks' option," be offered, his man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner changed. Now that Rand was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">factor, be would raise the money if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad to steal it. Rand, it might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">added, at one time attempted to win</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from Joe the love of Gertrude</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crowinshield, with disastrous results to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rand's right eye. Since then there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a coolness between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twenty dollars for an option," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated Joe impatiently. "How about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Done!" exclaimed Barnum. "Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustle around for that twenty. I'm in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hurry. And. mind you," he added,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning from the operation of crank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his automobile, "two weeks is all</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll get. Although you and I are</seg><seg type="columnLine">212</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">good friends, I'll sell out to Rand if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't get the coin. Business is busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's fair enough," said Joe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Only don't trouble yourself about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rand," he added grimly; "I'll get the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he considered means of rais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing money, Joe's mind turned instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Amos Studley, regardless of the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that their relations never had been what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you might call neighborly. They sel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom met but to quarrel, usually about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe's potato field, and usually, during</seg><seg type="columnLine">these discussions, Amos lost his tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per. Secretly Joe maintained a liking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his choleric neighbor, while deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in his heart, Amos nursed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration for the youthful Bender.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore, Joe decided without hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation that Amos should purchase his</seg><seg type="columnLine">potato field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three elements entered into Joe's de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termination to sell his land to Studley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">First, Studley's potato field adjoined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parcel of property he wished to sell;</seg><seg type="columnLine">secondly, Amos made a specialty of po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatoes ; and, thirdly, Amos had plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of money. These arguments were un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">answerable, thought Joe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten minutes after Barnum had left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe crossed his field and found Stud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley instructing two swarthy sons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Italy in the art of applied hoeing. Ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently the lesson had not been won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derfully successful, for the farmer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrinkled face was flushed. Had Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">been less engrossed in his "big idea,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might have scented an impending</seg><seg type="columnLine">squall, and waited for a more favorable</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment to broach his proposition. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead. he sailed blindly but enthusi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">astically ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got five minutes, Amos?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amos eyed his neighbor silently for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, then walked off a few paces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I s'pose," he began, with a frown,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that you've come over here to kick</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">about one of my cows getting into your</seg><seg type="columnLine">field ?" He looked up expectantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing like that," answered Joe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a short laugh. "I've come over on</seg><seg type="columnLine">business." Amos stiffened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, business!" said he, with fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarcasm. "Now, why didn't you men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that in the first place? You would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have saved time for both of us." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowned for a moment. "Waal?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe spat accurately at a potato bug,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground the enemy into the earth with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heel, and cleared his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Amos," he said, "I want to get rid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my potato field. Twenty-four hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred dollars and it's yours. How about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. shall I see about the deeds to-day?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You shall not," answered Amos pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itively. "I don't want your blamed old</seg><seg type="columnLine">potato field. I might take it as a gift,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because it's good potato land; but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">for buying it"--he laughed shortly--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"not on your life! I've got troubles</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough now." He started back toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laborers, but Joe restrained him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a firm hand upon his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not so fast, Amos," he protested.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I need the money, and I could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">along without the land. You could</seg><seg type="columnLine">spare the money and could use the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">to good advantage. It adjoins your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">potato field. Think it over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've thought it over all I'm a-goin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">to," answered Amos, shaking off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. "I tell ye I don't want the land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whether I've got the money or not ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">got anything to do with it. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want any more land, and, what's more,,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no man is goin' to force his potato fields</seg><seg type="columnLine">down my windpipe!" He regarded Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">defiantly. Joe regarded him silently for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, then his face hardened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Amos," said he, "when I try to force</seg><seg type="columnLine">land on another man I'll not be in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">right mind. It's a straight business</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal with me every time. And. let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you," be added, bis voice rising in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignantly, "you'll have to get down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">your knees and beg before I'll sell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that land now!" He snapped his fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">A CRAVE SITUATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">213</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gers disdainfully, and departed with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amos regarded him for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then cackled. "The knees of my pants</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't bag fer some time." he remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">dryly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe returned to his work with anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his heart, and, although he worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with feverish energy until late in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon, he could not shake off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of resentment. After a hearty</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper, however, as he sat on his fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vorite spot on the back steps, smok-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. he cooled off somewhat. He racked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain for means of disposing of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, or some other way of raising eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred dollars. He went to bed with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a solution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For ten days, Joe tried every scheme</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could think of to raise money. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">centered his energies in an effort to sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">the potato field, but failed to get a bite.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A young married man from the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">visited town in search of a small place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe promptly collared him, and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out to his place. No house went</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the field, however, and the stran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger politely declined to buy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe tried the national bank, but John</seg><seg type="columnLine">P. Crowinshield spiked that gun. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid a fatherly hand on Joe's shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and advised him not to fool with sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond mortgages. He didn't want to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe get in too deep, he explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Undiscouraged, Joe sought Henry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Craig, an old family friend, who, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife and widowed daughter, lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the north part of the town. Craig</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened politely, then shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But this is such a beautiful oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity!" explained Joe in despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry, Joe," answered Craig,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but I can't do it. If you were in real</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble I'd be only too glad to help you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this is different. Win that girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">with your own wits and muscles, Joe;</seg><seg type="columnLine">not with a friend's money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe drove home in gloomy spirits. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not discouraged, but for the life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of him he could not figure out where</seg><seg type="columnLine">that eight hundred dollars was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from. However, he still hoped that op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity would knock at his door be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the option expired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Opportunity arrived the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next forenoon, while Joe was repairing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a henhouse. It came from town in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobile and amid a cloud of dust.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barnum played the role unconsciously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and entered the yard, ignorant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that he was to act the part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">good angel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, there, Joe!" said he briskly, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hopped out of his pulsating motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">car. "Just thought I'd stop off and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread a little gossip." He laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly. "There's a merry row up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">town," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uh hull!" answered Joe, continuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his work on the henhouse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're going to have a new ceme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery," said Barnum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A cemetery! Place where they bury</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, you idiot!" exclaimed Barnum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with good-natured impatience. "Lem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">me explain: Father Murphy, of All</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saint's Church, has just awoke to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that his dead parishoners are scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered about the township sort of pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miscuouslike, as you might say, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't see the fitness of it. He wants</seg><seg type="columnLine">an honest-to-goodness, regulation cem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etery, same as the other churches have."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is there scandalous about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?" asked Joe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's no objection to his having</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cemetery," answered Barnum. "No-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body cares a hang if he has a dozen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. What they're frothing at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth about is the fact that he has his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes on the old Dean place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The deuce you say,!" exclaimed Joe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The same," said Barnum. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can imagine the outbreak that greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bit of news.

Poor Father Mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phy didn't stop to consider that the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dean place was the first place in town</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be cleared back in the days of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians. I didn't know about it myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">until recently."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," demanded Joe, "what are</seg><seg type="columnLine">they going to do about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, they protested," answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, with a laugh. "Yes, indeed, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly did protest! Father Murphy</seg><seg type="columnLine">met them fairly, but his parishoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't fancy the tone of the protest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Can't say as I blame 'em, at that. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't beat the average New Englander</seg><seg type="columnLine">in stating hard, cold facts in a way that</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not fail to be understood.

Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because," answered Joe, dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hammer and making for the barn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll save them the bother."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe hitched up his horse and drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly to the parish house of All</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Saints' Church, where he was closeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Father Murphy for over an hour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He emerged smiling, shook bands with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parish priest, and took the steps in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a jump.

Past differences,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far as he was concerned, were for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">given.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine day," said he, as he hopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his buggy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jus' so," muttered Amos, as Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove off. He paused a moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed at the retreating buggy, puzzled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wondered--but it was too prepos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terous! He dismissed the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his mind, and walked on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime Joe drove out to see Henry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Craig. He found that gentleman en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged far out in a cornfield. Joe talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily while Henry listened. At first</seg><seg type="columnLine">he frowned in perplexity, then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned, and bit off a chew of "Honey</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dew." Before Joe finished talking, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was laughing, and he was laughing long</seg><seg type="columnLine">after Joe had driven off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amos Studley, going out to feed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock early the following morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped short halfway between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and barn, and stared. A strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight greeted his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the devil!" he exclaimed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of this outburst was Joe Bender,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a notoriously late riser, performing</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange antics out in his potato field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under one arm he carried a bunch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly hewed stakes, while in the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand he carried a hatchet. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace off a distance, drive a stake, pace</seg><seg type="columnLine">off another distance, and drive another</seg><seg type="columnLine">stake. This he continued for upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an hour, until the entire field was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dotted with stakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amos found time to watch his young</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbor occasionally as he performed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his morning work. He saw Joe drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">off toward town about eight o'clock, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">A GRAVE SITUATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">215</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned bis work for a moment to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch him. When the buggy had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared from view, he smiled craftily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Evidently Joe don't know the law,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he chuckled, highly pleased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless, after his chores were</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished, he crossed the field and studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stakes with interest. Thanks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe's crudity, he could make neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads or tails out of them. After puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zling over it for a while, Amos gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">it up, and returned to his work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe drove back from town about an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour later, and in the buggy with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat Father Murphy. Amos, ever watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, witnessed the arrival, and covertly</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched them from a sheltered spot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two men walked slowly about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field, Joe doing most of the talking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">much pointing, while the priest was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent to listen. After a time, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed into the buggy and returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout the performance in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field, Amos had chuckled softly to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Now that they were gone, Amos</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated himself upon his front veranda</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waited. When Joe returned, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour later, aloue, Amos strolled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the road to meet him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just wanted a minute's talk with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye," he explained, as Joe halted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse in response to an upraised hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe waited expectantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "H'mm!" began Amos, a crafty smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing over his features. ''See you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a visitor this morning." Joe's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared, and he smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ' Oh, yes," said he.

"It's not good sport</seg><seg type="columnLine">to endanger life, and it's not good sport</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dare every one to take such a fool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardy chance. Why, you wouldn't let</seg><seg type="columnLine">your wife go in there if she really</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to do it; and you're crazy if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">go yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The whole trouble began with poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Fielding's death," said Arling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a shrug.

His death was shock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. of course, but the people made too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much fuss about it. Everybody said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Purgatory was a death trap, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no one would ever ride there again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, I'm trying to redeem the poor old</seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH PURGATORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">219</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">valley. If I'm willing to ride there my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, and let my wife, that shows what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think about it, doesn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll follow you, Arling!" called out</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ted Braddock, just out of college, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">desirous of having a voice in affairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crossfield frowned upon the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man contemptuously.

"Well, I won't follow you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arling," he added, "as I have already</seg><seg type="columnLine">said; and I should hate to think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Arling would do anything so reck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't expect to stir up such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempest," said Arling. evidently not dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased with the developments.

His horse was a line chest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nut gelding, one of the best in his fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther's stable, and the sight of it brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden impulse to Crossfield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strode quickly across the yard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the stirrup leather out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster's hands, with friendly fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliarity rather than rudeness, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily measured it for himself on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''I'll take your horse, if you don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, Ted," he said boldly, as he shifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buckle.

"By Jove, that's rather too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much, you know ! You said you weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to ride, you know.

"Sorry, Ted, but I've just</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to ride. This will be a hunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I wouldn't care to miss. Hope I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a chance to do something for you</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swung into the saddle, leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man still protesting, and rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the yard at a fast gallop. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling had come upon him that he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">see who entered upon the projected</seg><seg type="columnLine">dash through the dangerous valley, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt an added satisfaction in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that he might be saving Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Braddock's son from a rash adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">by depriving him of his horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The field was at the third fence on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tomlinson farm when Crossfield</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">overtook it on the fast chestnut, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunters cheered him gayly as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went over the rails after them. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fresh, breezy morning, and the horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">were full of ginger, many of them hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to be held hard on the curb in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">exuberance of spirit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Crossfield passed the riders that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were holding to the rear, he saw Ben</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arling and his wife riding hard at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front, with Harry Tennant following</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely. Peggy Arling's big, rangy</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, F.rebus, was already shining with</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous sweat, and the delicate veins</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood out like cords on his satiny skin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peggy was pulling hard on the curb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the notoriously vicious horse was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flirting his head and fretting at the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">straint with constantly increasing anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arling's own mount was one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best hunters in the field, Irish bred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">English trained, but as mikl-tcmpered</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Erebus was vicious, and Crossfield</seg><seg type="columnLine">was furious when he perceived that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arling was holding steadily about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">length in advance of the black horse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereby aggravating its ill humor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">making it the harder for his wife to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of the women sought the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">gates and the gaps in the hedges, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a fast company in general, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jumps on the Tomlinson and Drake</seg><seg type="columnLine">places were taken at a steady drive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were no spills, and all but four</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the field were in joyous</seg><seg type="columnLine">mood.

His wife's pallor had in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased, it seemed to Crossfield, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were larger than usual. Harry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tennant was simply grim ; he rode hard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his eyes to the front, never open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his lips or turning his head to reply</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the casual jests that were flung at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from the rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two miles of good country were cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered; then, before any one seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize it, the last meadow on the Drake</seg><seg type="columnLine">place was behind them, and the old saw-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■</seg><seg type="columnLine">222</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mill could be seen by the roadside, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter of a mile away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hounds swarmed down the road,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the hunters saw them break and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause beyond the mill; then, leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, they disappeared into the verdant</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley below. They saw the huntsman</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to check them, but without suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess, and then they saw him ride after</seg><seg type="columnLine">his charges into the ravine, but at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautious pace, with his horse held in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm through for to-day!" cried Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winant, pulling up her roan mare.

"He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">good for the jumps!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did not turn her head or so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as nod to show that she heard him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erebus took off at the three-foot stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall with scarcely a break in his wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace, clearing it as though it were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a hummock on the turf. Ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling's mount, Ladybird, was well in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and it took the wall conserva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively, losing a couple of lengths in</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tennant came on, a close third, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had a handful in Featherheels. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse had been trained as a steeple-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chase racer, and it took off abruptly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with little pause, and did not "dwell" on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farther side of the juiftp; so Ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant, accustomed to country hunters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself pitching in the saddle like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a novice, and holding on for his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew, however, that the horse could</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay--that it would be with him when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he called for action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came presently to the first nasty</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump, a rail fence with a ten-foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">breadth of brushwood on the near side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erebus checked his mad flight when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to it, and took the long leap with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an obvious effort. There was stubble</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the far side, with pebbles and sand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the black horse floundered an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant. snorting angrily as be gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself together and dashed on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arling went over cautiously, picking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jump, and was a dozen lengths be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind his wife when he went on. Feath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erheels took it like an old racer, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to Ladybird when he gained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">turf beyond the stubble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three now rode for the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump, a wide, deep brook that tumbled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">v</seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH PURGATORY	223</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">noisily over rocks, with a rough hedge</seg><seg type="columnLine">four feet high and as many broad on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the near side of it, and with nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddy gravel at the take-off. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump, it was often said, was the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning of "hell." Beyond it there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a half mile more of the valley, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that stretch were six jumps, terminat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the five-barred gate with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-foot drop beyond it--the jump</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had killed Tom Fielding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peggy's hands no longer tugged at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reins ; she merely held her seat. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat was off and her long, fair hair was</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose and fluttering behind her as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black horse ran wild. His hoofs threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the gravel as he struck the take-off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he slid for a yard, but it did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop him. He rose splendidly over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hedge, clearing the difficult jump like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bird, and ran on beyond the brook,</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster, wilder than ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arling and Tennant came close be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind. They had passed the plodding</seg><seg type="columnLine">huntsman, and they could no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the horses of the other riders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tennant was holding back Featherheels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Arling came to the jump first. Lady-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird slid into the wet gravel and floun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered. Arling struck her with his crop</seg><seg type="columnLine">an(J swore. She reared, floundered</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and refused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Featherheels took off without a slip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cleared the hedge and brook pret-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tily, then Tennant checked him in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran, and looked back for Arling. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter had not followed. Tennant looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously ahead, and saw Peggy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black horse clear the next fence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he whirled about, rode roughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the brook and a ragged gap in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hedge, and saw Arling walking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse slowly toward the bank that led</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the road above the ravine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Arling," called Tennant sharply, "is</seg><seg type="columnLine">your horse hurt ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, but she's done--she refused!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied the M. F. H. curtly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tennant touched his horse with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spur and leaped to Arling's side. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the mare's bridle with his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and pulled her sharply around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No man or horse will refuse now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arling!" he cried. "We'll finish the run</seg><seg type="columnLine">--you and 1 !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arling swore, and struck him over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head with his crop. Tennant took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow; but he turned Ladybird's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the water jump and struck her</seg><seg type="columnLine">furiously across the rump with his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">crop. She squealed shrilly, and leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. Before her rider could check</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, she was over the brook, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">striving desperately to keep his scat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tennant took the jump again, close</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him, and raced even with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the marshy turf beyond. Arling</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove to rein in the mare, but Tennant</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck her again with his crop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on, Arling!" he thundered. "Go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, or I'll kill you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mare was entirely beyond Ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling's control, in spite of his strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">and horsemanship, and he fought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep his seat just as his wife was light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to keep hers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tennant pressed hard upon the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider at the second jump beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brook and slashed at the mare again as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she took off. They went over together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Arling swayed in the saddle, catch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the mare's mane to save himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arling's mount stumbled and went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. knees, and the man almost fell, hut</seg><seg type="columnLine">the merciless Tennant threw his horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">back on its haunches, to reach back like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a polo player and cut the mare again</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his crop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ladybird was panic-stricken when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she dashed on, and she was breathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard from fright and strain. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence was no more than three and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, but she topped it with her heels</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she went over, and narrowly missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arling's pallor was now more from</seg><seg type="columnLine">fright than anger. He had lost his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve. He was afraid of the horse un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der him and afraid of the man that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode relentlessly at his side. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">224</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PEOPLE'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not stop his mount in her frantic flight;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not even fall from the saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">at such a pace, and least of all could</seg><seg type="columnLine">he move a hand to combat his enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With their eyes strained ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, the two men saw the woman and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black demon rise over the brush</seg><seg type="columnLine">hedge and disappear into the thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">foliage that lay beyond it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That jump, Arling!" gasped Ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant breathlessly; "and then the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate! We'll finish together!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were over the hedge the next in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant, and Arling was like a pale ghost</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to the saddle. It was a three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred-yard dash to the gate, and Ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant's breath almost stopped as they be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan it. He did not believe that Peggy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse could make the gate. His own</seg><seg type="columnLine">mount was now showing the strain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long run, and.he expected to makp</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in the fatal crash. The ghastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture flashed through his mind in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the awful remaining seconds: three</seg><seg type="columnLine">riders falling at the gate where Torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fielding fell--the spot made tragically</seg><seg type="columnLine">historic for years!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw the opening in the tall trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the blue sky showed above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highway that ran past the gate. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peggy's fair head against the light, ris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and falling with the leaps of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse. Tennant was as wild as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses now, and he looked at the fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic mare beside him with savagely cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culating eyes. It seemed to him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">her pace was flagging, and he raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crop and struck her again with all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he saw the gate. The girl he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had loved and lost, whom he had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">on loving in his secret heart, was dash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward it, and her horse would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never clear it. The three-foot drop be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low it would not be needed to complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tragedy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the topmost bar of the gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell. The next one followed it. A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pulling them off, working furi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ously to tear down the barrier in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the charging black runaway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another instant but two bars re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained. and Erebus fairly loped across</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, gaining the road in safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man at the gate courageously</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw himself upon the last two bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the other horses came on, tearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them away from the posts, and leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">for safety. Arling's mare was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him as he did so, and his leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">added to her terror. She shied sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right, and crashed into the stout</seg><seg type="columnLine">post. Her rider went into the air, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell in the middle of the macadam road,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Featherheels, quick of eve and hoof,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped over the fallen mare and landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the road below; then, heedless of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider, and still ardent in the chase, raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the black horse, which was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearing around a turn in the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crossfield, who had ridden around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ridge to the south of the valley, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the gate in time to tear it down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed upon the strange scene for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in a helpless daze; then, hurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the pink-coated form huddled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road, he knelt beside it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes later a horse walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">sedately, and a little wearily, around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the turn of the road and approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.
