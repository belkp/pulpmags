From the start</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole thing has the precision of</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine work. Fate and its working--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wonderful Providence which watches</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Man and his future. The whole thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">unerring: the incident, the work, the ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamity, and the martyr. In the retrospect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disaster we may all of us grow strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">in wisdom. Let us go into history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A hot July day. A sun of scant pity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a staggering street; panting thousands</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dragging along, hatless; the sultry venge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of a real day of summer. A day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot pavements, and wrecked endeavor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartaches for the seashore, for leafy</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowers beside rippling water, a day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken hopes and listless ambition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps Fate chose the day because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its heat and because of its natural benefit</seg><seg type="columnLine">on fecundity. We have no way of know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. But we do know this: the date, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, the meeting; the boy with the burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing glass and the old doctor. So common-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, so trivial and hidden in obscurity!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">6</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who would have guessed it? Yet it is--</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the creation---one of the most im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant dates in the world's history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is saying a whole lot. Let us go</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it and see what it amounts to. Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us trace the thing out in history, weigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">it up and balance it with sequence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Of Charley Huyck we know nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to this day. It is a thing which, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some reason, he has always kept hidden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Recent investigation as to his previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">life and antecedents have availed us noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Perhaps he could have told but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he has gone down as the world's great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">martyr, there is no hope of gaining from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips what we would so like to know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After all, it does not matter. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day--the incident, and its purport,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its climax of sequence to the day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great disaster. Also we have the blasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains and the lake of blue water</seg><seg type="columnLine">which will ever live with his memory. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatness is not of warfare, nor personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambition; but of all mankind. The wreaths</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we bestow upon him have no doubtful</seg><seg type="columnLine">color. The man who saved the earth!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">From such a beginning, Charley Huyck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lean and frail of body, with, even then,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The red light of terror shot straight up into space, a thousand miles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the four great, wonderful globes held the life of the sun captive to</seg><seg type="columnLine">man for the few precious seconds that would spell the difference be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween life and everlasting oblivion</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the wistfulness of the idealist, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of a poet. Charley Huyck, the boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing the hot pavement with his pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of papers; the much treasured piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass in his pocket, and the sun which only</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should master burning down upon him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A moment out of the ages; the turning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straw destined to out-balance all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous accumulation of man's history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun was hot and burning, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">child--he could not have been more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten--cast a glance over his shoulder. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the way of calculation. In the hey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day of childhood he was not dragged down</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the heat and weather; he had the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiasm of his half-score of years and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the joy of the plaything. We will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">presume to call it the spirit of the scientist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it was, perhaps, the spark of latent</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigation that was destined to lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment picked out of destiny! A</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy and a plaything. Uncounted jnillions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of boys have played with glass and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun rays. Who cannot remember the little,</seg><seg type="columnLine">round-burning dot in the palm of the hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the subsequent exclamation? Charley</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huyck had found a new toy; it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple thing and as old as glass. Fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">will ever be so in her working.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the doctor? Why should he have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been waiting? If it was not destiny, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at least an accumulation of moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the heavy eye-glasses, the square, close-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut beard; and his uncompromising fact-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking expression. Those who knew Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Robold are strong in the affirmation that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was the antithesis of all emotion. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the sternest product of science: un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending, hardened by experiment, and caus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic toward the frailness of human nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had been his one function to topple</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the castles of the foolish; with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard-seeing wisdom he had spotted sophis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try where we thought it not. Even into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">castles of science he had gone like a jug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gernaut. It is hard to have one's theories</seg><seg type="columnLine">derided--yea, even for a scientist--and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be called a fool! Dr. Robold knew no</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle language; he was not relished by</seg><seg type="columnLine">science.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS memory, as we have it, is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an eccentric. A man of slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">compassion, abrupt of manner and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no tact in speaking. Genius is often so;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is a strange fact that many of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest of men have been denied by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows. A great man and laughter. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not accepted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> None of us know today what it cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Robold. He was not the man to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Perhaps Charley Huyck might; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips are sealed forever. We only know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he retired to the mountain, and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subsequent flood of benefits that rained</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon mankind. And we still denied him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The great cynic on the mountain. Of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrets of the place we know little. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not the man to accept the investiga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor; he despised the curious. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at--let be--he would work alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the great moment of the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the light of the past we may well</seg><seg type="columnLine">bend knee to the doctor and his protege,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charley Huyck. Two men and destiny!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What would we be without them? One</seg><seg type="columnLine">shudders to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little thing, and yet one of the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments in the world's history. It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been Fate. Why was it that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern man, who hated all emotion, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">so have unbended at this moment? That</seg><seg type="columnLine">we cannot answer. But we can conjecture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mayhap it is this: We were all wrong;</seg><seg type="columnLine">we accepted the man's exterior and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fession as the fact of his marrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No man can lose all emotion. The doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, after all, even as ourselves--he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">human. Whatever may be said, we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the certainty of that moment, and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charley Huyck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun's rays were hot; they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning; the pavements were intolerable;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the baked air in the canoned- street was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing like that of an oven; a day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog-days. The boy crossing the street;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms full of papers, and the glass bulg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in his little hip-pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the curb he stopped. With such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun it was impossible to long forget his</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaything. He drew it carefully out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket, laid down a paper and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN WHO SAVED THE EARTH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">distancing his glass for the focus. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not notice the man beside him. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should he? The round dot, the brownish</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke, the red spark and the flash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame! He stamped upon it. A moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of boyhood; an experimental miracle</seg><seg type="columnLine">as old as the age of glass, and just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">delightful. The boy had spoiled the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a great Governor of a great State; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paper was still salable. He had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">his moment. Mark that moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hand touched his shoulder. The lad</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yessir. Star or Bulletin?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll take one of each," said the man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There now. I was just watching you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you know what you were doing?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yessir. Burning paper. Startin' fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's the way the Indians did it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man smiled at the perversion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact. There is not such a distance between</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticks and glass in the age of childhood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know;" he said. "The Indians. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you know how it was done; the why--</seg><seg type="columnLine">whv the paper began to blaze?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yessir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, explain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy looked up at him. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">city boy and used to the streets. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was some old high-brow challenging his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisdom. Of course he* knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the sun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There," laughed the man. "Of course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You said you knew, but you don't. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't the sun, without the glass, burn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paper? Tell me that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy was still looking up at him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw that the man was not like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others on the street. It may be that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange intimacy kindled into being at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moment. Certainly it was a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbending for the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would if it was hot enough or you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get enough of it together."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! Then that is what the glass is</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yessir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Concentration?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Con--I don't know, sir. But it's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun. She's sure some hot. I know a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the sun, sir. I've studied it with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass. The glass picks up all the rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">and puts them in one hole and that's what</seg><seg type="columnLine">burns the paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's lots of fun. I'd like to have a bigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">one; but it's all I've got. Why, do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, if I had a glass big. enough and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a place to stand, I'd burn up the earth?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The old man laughed. "Why, Archime-</seg><seg type="columnLine">des! I thought you were dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My name ain't Archimedes. It's Charley</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huyck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, is it? Well, that's a good name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. And if you keep on you'll make it as</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous as you did the other." Wherein</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was foretelling history. "Where do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">live?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy was still looking. Ordinarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would not have told, but he motioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with his thumb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I doVt live; I room over on Brennan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I see.

The subtle, odorless</seg><seg type="columnLine">pall was silently shrouding out over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. In a short time the hospitals were</seg><seg type="columnLine">full and it was necessary to call in medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid from San Francisco. They had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even time for diagnosis. The new plague</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fatal almost at conception.

In the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such terror there were those who stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with grimness and sacrifice hung to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their posts for mankind. There are some</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had said that the stuff of heroes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed away. Let them consider the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">of John Robinson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Robinson was a telegraph operator. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til that day he was a poor unknown; not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whit better than his fellows.

Ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribly thirsty. Will stick it out if I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">get enough water.

When</seg><seg type="columnLine">they returned in the fall they went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving beef-steaks. But inland cattle must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have more than forage.

It was four</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock when he drew up at the little pine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheltered cabin that was his headquarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the summer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been on the road since midnight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was tired. The long weary hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving, the grades, the unvaried stress</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the deep red dust, the heat, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch of a night and day had worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">both mind and muscle. It had been his</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to go after salt; now that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, he could lie in for a bit of rest while</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brothers did the salting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a peaceful spot this cabin of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pizzozis; nestled among the virgin shade</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, great tall feathery sugar-pines with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mountain live-oak spreading over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door yard. To the east the rising heights</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Sierras, misty, gray-green, undu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating into the distance to the pink-white</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow crests of Little Alpine. Below in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon, the waters of the Mokolumne; to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the west the heavy dark mass of Mt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heckla, deep verdant in the cool of coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe drew up under the shade of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">live oak. The air was Jtull of the cool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet scent of the afternoon. No moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have been more peaceful; the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear sky overhead, the breath of summer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the soothing spice of the pine trees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A shepherd dog came bounding from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway to meet him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was his favorite cow dog. Usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Joe came back the dog would be far</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the road to forestall him. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered, absently, coming up, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog's delay. A dog is most of all a creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of habit; only something unusual would</seg><seg type="columnLine">detain him. However the dog was here;</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the man drew up he rushed out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">greet him. A rush, a circle, a bark, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whine of welcome. Perhaps the dog had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Joe noticed that whine; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise in the ways of dogs; when Ponto</seg><seg type="columnLine">whined like that there was something un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual. It was not effusive nor spontaneous;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but rather of the delight of succor. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarce a minute of petting, the dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatted and faced to the westward. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">whine was startling; almost fearful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pizzozi knew that something was wrong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The dog drew up, his stub tail erect, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hair all bristled; one look was for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">master and the other whining and alert</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mt. Heckla. Puzzled, Joe gazed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain. But he saw nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was it the canine instinct, or was it</seg><seg type="columnLine">just coincidence? We have the account</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Pizzozi. From the words of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Italian, the dog was afraid. It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way of Ponto; usually in the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger he was alert and eager; now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew away to the cabin. Joe wondered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside the shack he found nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence of departure. There was no sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his brothers. It was his turn to go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep; he was wearied almost to numbness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for forty-eight hours he had not closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eyelid. On -the table were a few un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed dishes and crumbs of eating. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the three rifles that hung usually on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall was missing; the coffee pot was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor with the lid open. On the bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coverlets were mussed up. It was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">temptation to go to sleep. Back of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open door and Ponto. The whine of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dog drew his will and his conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness fftto correlation. A faint rustle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sugar-pines came from the canon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe watched the dog. The sun was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing over the crest of the mountain;</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the western line the deep lacy silhou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ettes of the pine trees and the bare bald</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of Heckla. What was it? His brothers</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be on hand for the salting; it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not their custom to put off things for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow. Shading his eyes he stepped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dog rose stealthily and walked be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side him, uneasily, with the same insistent</seg><seg type="columnLine">whine and ruffled hair. Joe listened. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain murmurs, the sweet breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the forest, and in the lapse of bated</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath the rippling melody of the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">far below him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What you see, Ponto? What you see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the words the dog sniffed and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced slightly--a growl and then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden scurry to the heels of his master.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ponto was afraid. It puzzled Pizzozi. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever it was that roused his fear, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on Mt. Heckla.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS is one of the strange parts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the story--the part the dog played,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what came after. Although it is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trivial thing it is one -of the most inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicable. Did the dog sense it? We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no measure for the range of instinct, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">we do have it that before the destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Pompeii the beasts roared in their cages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still, knowing what we now know, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to accept the analogy. It may, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, have been coincidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless it decided Pizzozi. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle needed salt. He would catch up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinto and ride over to the salt logs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is no moment in the cattle in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dustry quite like the salting on the range.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is not the most spectacular perhaps, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely it is not lacking in intenseness. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of Pizzozi was musical even if not</seg><seg type="columnLine">operatic. He had a long-range call, a rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythm that for depth and tone had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar effect on the shattered stillness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN WHO SAVED THE EARTH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It echoed and reverberated, and pealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bottom to the top of the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain. The salt call is the talisman of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alleewahoo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two thousand cattle augmented by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand strays held up their heads in</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer. The sniff of the welcome salt call!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the whole range of the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice the stock stopped in their leafy</seg><seg type="columnLine">pasture, and listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alleewahoo !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An old cow bellowed. It was the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning of bedlam. From the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain to the top and for miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond went forth the salt call. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand head bellowed to the delight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of salting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pizzozi rode along. Each lope of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinto through the tall tangled miserie was</seg><seg type="columnLine">accented. "Alleewahoo! Alleewahoo!" The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rending of brush, the confusion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pandemonium spread to the very bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the leafy gulches. It was no place for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pedestrian. Heads and tails erect, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle were stampeding toward the logs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few head had beat him to it. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">he quickly drove away and cut the sack</seg><seg type="columnLine">open. With haste he poured it upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">logs; then he rose out of the dust that</seg><seg type="columnLine">for yards about the place was tramped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the finest powder. The center of a herd</seg><seg type="columnLine">of salting range stock is no place for com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort. The man rode away; to the left he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascended a low knob where he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be safe from the stampede; but close</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to distinguish the brands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In no time the place was alive with</seg><seg type="columnLine">milling stock. Old cows, heifers, bulls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">calves, steers rushed out of the crashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush into the clearing. There is no mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment exactly like it. What before had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a broad clearing of brownish reddish</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust was trampled into a vast cloud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellowing blur, a thousand cattle, and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming. From the farthest height came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoing call. Pizzozi glanced up at the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mountain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then a strange thing happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From what we gathered from the excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">accounts of Pizzozi it was instantaneous;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet by the same words it was of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar and beautiful effect as never</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be forgotten. A bluish azure shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with a myriad flecks of crimson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar vividness of opalescence. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole world, scintillating; the sky, the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain, a vast flame of color so</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide and so intense that there seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a thing beside it. And instantaneous--</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was over almost before it was started.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No noise nor warning, and no subsequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">detonation. As silent as winking and much,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, like the queer blur of color induced</seg><seg type="columnLine">by defective vision. All in the fraction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second. Pizzozi had been gazing at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain. There was no mountain!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither were there cattle. Where before</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the shade of the towering peak</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now the rays of the western sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where had been the blur of the milling</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd and its deafening pandemonium was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now a strange silence. The transparency</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the air was unbroken into the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far off lay a peaceful range in the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set. There was no mountain! Neither were</seg><seg type="columnLine">there cattle!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment the man had enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do with his plunging mustang. In the blur</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the subsequent second Pizzozi remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers nothing but a convulsion of fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">horseflesh bucking, twisting, plunging, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentle pinto suddenly maddened into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">demon. It required all the skill of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowman to retain his saddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not know that he was riding on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rim of Eternity. In his mind was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim subconscious realization of a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had happened. In spite of all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts the horse fought backward. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">some moments before he conquered. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a slow, hesitant moment. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot account for what he will do in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open face of miracle. What the Italian</seg><seg type="columnLine">beheld was enough for terror. The sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">immensity of the thing was too much for</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the first sight his simple mind went</seg><seg type="columnLine">numb from sheer impotence; his terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a degree frozen. The whole of Mt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heckla had been shorn away; in the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">16</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of its darkened shadow the sinking sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">was blinking in his face; the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">western sky all golden. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestige of the flat salt clearing at the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mountain. Of the two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle milling in the dust not a one re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained. The man crossed himself in stupor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mechanically he put the spurs to the pinto.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the mustang would not answer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another struggle with bucking, fighting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maddened horseflesh. The cow-man must</seg><seg type="columnLine">needs bring in all the skill of his-training;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but by the time he had conquered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind had settled within some scope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pony had good reasons for its</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror. This time though the man's mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeled it did not go numb at the clash</seg><seg type="columnLine">of immensity. Not only had the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain been torn away, but its roots as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. The whole thing was up-side down;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world torn to its entrails. In place of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had been the height was a gulf so</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep that its depths were blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was standing on the brink. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cool man, was Pizzozi; but it was hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the confusion of such a miracle to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly; much less to reason. The prancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustang was snorting terror. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The very dizziness of the gulf, sheer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">losing itself into shadows and chaos, over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">powered him, his mind now clear enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for perception reeled at the distance. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth was nauseous. His whole body suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumbed to a sudden qualm of weakness;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sickness that comes just before falling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went limp in the saddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the horse fought backward; warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by instinct it drew back from the sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks of the gulf. It had no reason but</seg><seg type="columnLine">its nature. At the instant it sensed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapping of the iron will of its master. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment it had turned and was racing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its wild way out of the mountains. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">supreme moments a cattle horse will al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways hit for home. The pinto and its limp</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider were fleeting on the road to Jackson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pizzozi had no knowledge of what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred in Oakland. To him the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing had been but a flash of miracle; he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could not reason. He did not curb his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse. That he was still in the saddle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">due mare to the near instinct of his train-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing than to his volition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not even draw up at the cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That he could make better time with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor than with his pinto did not occur</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. His mind was far too busy; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that the thing was past, too full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror. It was forty-four miles to town;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it" was night and the stars were shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he rode into Jackson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"MAN-A GREAT LITTLE BUG"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND what of Charley Huyck?

He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first and perhaps the last of the school</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Dr. Robold, a peculiar combination of</seg><seg type="columnLine">poetry and fact, a man of vision, of vast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">far-seeing faith and idealism linked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">based on the coldest and sternest truths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">materialism.

Which any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us who have read or been at school know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is not.

Perfectly willing to follow as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as facts permitted, he refused to step</seg><seg type="columnLine">off into speculation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Which was the point between them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charley Huyck had vision; although exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">as any man, he had ever one part of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind soaring out into speculation.

Cosmic grandeur; mind; chaos,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eternity--a night for dreaming. Whoever</seg><seg type="columnLine">had chosen the spot in the desert had</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked full well. Charley had spoken of</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness. On that night when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed up at the stars he was its personifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation. Surely a good spirit was watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cool wind was blowing; on its breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated the murmurs from the village;</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter, the song of children, the purring</seg><seg type="columnLine">of motors and the startled barking of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog; the confused drone of man and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization. From the eminence the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servatory looked down upon the town and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheen of light, Spotting like jewels in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dim gloom of the desert.-To the east</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mellow .moon just tipping over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain. Charley stepped to the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could see it all. The subtle beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was so akin to poetry; the stretch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the desert, the mountains, the light in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eastern sky; the dull level shadow that</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked the plain to the northward. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">the west the mountains looming black to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the star line. A beautiful night; sweet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened with the breath of desert and tuned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its slumber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Across the lawn he watched the profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor descending the pathway under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">acacias. An automobile was coming up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driveway; as it drove up under the arcs</seg><seg type="columnLine">he noticed its powerful lines and its driver;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soft purr of its motor; its coating of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust. There is a lure about a great car</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming in from the desert. The car stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charley noted. Doubtless someone for Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams. If it were, he would go into the'</seg><seg type="columnLine">observatory alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the strict sense of the word Huyck</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not an astronomer. He had not made</seg><seg type="columnLine">it his profession. But for all that he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">things about the stars that the more exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">professors had not dreamed of. Between</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and the stars lay a secret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He crossed the office, passed through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">reception-room and thence to the stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">that led to the observatory. In the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would lapse before the coming of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend he would have ample time for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">observation. Somehow he felt that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was time for discovery. He had come down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Arizona to employ the lens of his friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">the astronomer. The instrument that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had erected on his own mountain in Colo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rado had not given him the full satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that he expected. Here in Arizona,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dry clear air, which had hitherto</seg><seg type="columnLine">given such splendid results, he hoped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find what he was after. But little did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect to discover the terrible thing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is one of the strange parts of the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that he should be here at the very mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment when Fate and the world's safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have had him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy and the burning glass had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown under the tutelage of Dr. Robold:</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time was about at hand when he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">out-rival the saying of Archimedes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though the world knew it not, Charley</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huyck had arrived at the point where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could literally burn up the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he was not sinister: though he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power he had of course not the slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est intention. He was a dreamer and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was part of his dream that man break his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thraldom to the earth and reach out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the universe. It was a great conception</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were it not for the terrible event which</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his life we have no doubt but what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have succeeded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was ten thirty when he mounted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps and seated himself. He glanced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his watch: he had a good ten minutes. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had computed before just the time for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">observation. For months he had waited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">just this moment; he had not hoped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be alone and now that he was in solitary</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession he counted himself fortunate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the stars and Charley Huyck knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret; and not even he dreamed what</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would amount to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From his pocket he drew a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers; most of them covered with nota-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions; some with drawings; and a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">sized map in colors.

A number of figures and a rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">computation. He nodded and then he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the observation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WOULD have been interesting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">study the face of Charley Huyck dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the next few moments. At first he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely receptive, his face placid but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the studious intentness of one who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the moment; and as he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find what he was after an eagerness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction. Then a queer blankness; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight movement of his body stopped, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tapping of his feet ceased entirely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a full five minutes an absolute in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentness. During that time he was out</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the stars beholding what not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had dreamed of. It was more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret; and what it was only Charley</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huyck of all the millions of men could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have recognized. Yet it was more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">even he had expected. When he at last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">drew away his face was chalklike; great</seg><seg type="columnLine">drops of sweat stood on his forehead; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrible truth in his eyes made him look</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten years older.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My God!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment indecision and strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">impotence.

The man thought of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">town below and its peril. But Huyck</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought also. He shouted in Winter's ear:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Never mind the town. Keep straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">north. Over yonder to the point of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.

Dimly now he realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were really running a race against</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Winters was a daredevil; the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">catastrophe sent a thrill of exultation</seg><seg type="columnLine">through him. It was the climax, the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of his life, to be driving at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred miles an hour under that wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roar was terrible. Before they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">half across it seemed to the two men that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very,sound would drown them. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing in the world but pandemon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ium. The strange flash was forgotten in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terror of the living wall that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching out to engulf them. Like in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects they whizzed in the open face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deluge. When they had reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip they were so close that the out-running</seg><seg type="columnLine">fringe of the surf was at their wheels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Around the point, with the wide open</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain before them.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew this dam and its construction; to</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlast the centuries. It had been whiffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a second.

His companion, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it happened, was in even better shape than</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, and waiting.

"In the name of Heaven, Charley, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it? What is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Came the answer; and it drove the lust</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all speed through Winters:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bob," said Charley, "it is the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world--if we don't make it.

He had been regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">as visionary; but in the face of what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred, visions were now the most prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical things for mankind. Besides, Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Williams had sent out to the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange portent of Huyck's note.

Could it be?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unfortunately we cannot give it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">description we would like to give.

Living,</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous, burning, twisting within with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand blending, iridescent beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors. Not like electricity but something</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinitely more powerful. Great mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnets that Huyck had charged out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaos. Glowing with the softest light;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole mountain brightened as in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream, and the town of Robold at its base</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit up with a beauty that was past behold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was new to Winters.

Not a sound; the whole works</seg><seg type="columnLine">a complicated mass covering a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">acres, driving with a silence that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic. Not a whir nor friction. Like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">living composite body pulsing and breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the strange and mysterious force that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been evolved from Huyck's theory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">kinetics. The four great steel conduits</seg><seg type="columnLine">running from the globes down the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mountain. In the center, at a point</seg><seg type="columnLine">midway between the globes, a massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel needle hung on a pivot and pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly at the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Winters and the aviator noted it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered. From the lower end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle was pouring a luminous stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale-blue opalescence, a stream much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a liquid, and of an unholy radiance. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not a liquid, nor fire, nor anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen by man before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was force.

No-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bocfy but the wildest dreamers would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceived it. The life of the sun. And cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive to man; at his will and volition. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the next few minutes we were to lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all! But in losing it we were to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves. It was fate and nothing else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was but one more thing upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain--the observatory and an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other needle apparently idle; but with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point much like a gigantic phonograph</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle. It rose square out of the observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory, and to Winters it gave an impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of a strange gun, or some implement</seg><seg type="columnLine">for sighting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was all. Coming with the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were making, the airmen had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time for further investigation.

We may control certain laws on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earth, but until we reach out farther we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are but playthings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Man is the intelligence of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The time will come when he must be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the intelligence of a great deal of space</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as well. At the present time you are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> merely fortunate and a victim of a kind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fate. That I am the instrument of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> earth's salvation is merely chance. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> real man is Dr. Robold. When he picked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> me up on the streets I had no idea that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the sequence of time would drift to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> this moment. He took me into his work</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and taught me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Recause he was sensitive and was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> laughed at, we worked in secret. And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> since his death, and out of respect to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> his memory, I have continued in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> same manner. Rut I have written doflfti</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> everything, all the laws, computations,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> formulas--everything; and I am now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> willing it to mankind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Robold had a theory on kinetics. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> was strange at first and a thing to laugh</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at; but he reduced it to laws as potent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and as inexorable as the laws of gravi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The luminous Opalescence that has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> almost destroyed us is but one of its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> minor manifestationsj It is a message</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of sinister intelligence; for back of it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> all is an Intelligence.

Spoken over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and flashed out to every clime, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">roused and revived the hope of mankind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who was this Charley Huyck? Uncounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of men had never heard his name;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were but few, very few who had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A message out of nowhere and of very</seg><seg type="columnLine">dubious and doubtful explanation. Celes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tial kinetics! Undoubtedly. But the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained nothing. However, man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to accept anything, so long as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a more lucid explanation we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back to the Arizona observatory and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Ed Williams. And a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">one it was truly; a certain proof that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness is more potent, far more so</seg><seg type="columnLine">than mere material; also that many laws</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our astronomers are very Â§pt to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">overturned in spite of their mathematics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charley Huyck was right. You cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure intelligence with a yard-stick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mathematics do not lie; but when applied</seg><seg type="columnLine">to consciousness they are very likely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kick backward. That is precisely what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The suddenness of Huyck's departure</seg><seg type="columnLine">had puzzled Professor Williams; that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the note which he found upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. It was not like Charley to go off</seg><seg type="columnLine">so in the stress of a moment. He had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even taken the time to get his hat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat. Surely something was amiss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He read the note carefully, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of wonder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look these up. Keep by the lens. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world goes up you will know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have not reached the mountain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What did he mean? Besides, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no data for him to work on. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that an errant breeze had plumped '</seg><seg type="columnLine">the information behind the bookcase.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevertheless he went into the observatory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for the balance of the night stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the lens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now there are uncounted millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars in the sky. Williams had nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go by. A needle in the hay-stack were an</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy task compared with the one that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was allotted. The flaming mystery, what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever it was that Huyck had seen, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not caught by the professor. Still, he won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered. "If the world goes up you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">know I have not reached the mountain."</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was the meaning?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he was not worried. The professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved Huyck as a visionary and smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a little at his delightful fancies. Doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less this was one of them. It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the news came flashing out of Oak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land that he began to take it seriously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then followed the disappearance of Mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heckla. "If the world goes up"--it began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look as if the words had meaning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was a frantic professor during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next few days. When he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the lens he was flashing out messages</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world for Charley Huyck. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know that Huyck was lying uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious and almost dead upon the desert.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That the world was coming to catastrophe</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew' full well; but where was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to save it? And most of all, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had his friend meant by the words, "look</seg><seg type="columnLine">these up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surely there must be some further in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">formation. Through the long, long hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stayed with the lens and waited. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he-found nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was three days. Who will ever forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">them? Surely not Professor Williams. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sweating blood. The whole world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to pieces without the trace of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation. All the mathematics, all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">accumulations of the ages had availed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. Charley Huyck held the secret.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was in the stars, and not an astronomer</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But with the seventeenth hour came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn of fortune. The professor was passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the office. The door was open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the same fitful wind which had played</seg><seg type="columnLine">the original prank was now just as fitfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">performing restitution. Williams noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piece of paper protruding from the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bookcase and fluttering in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze. He picked it up. The first words</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he saw were in the handwriting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charley Huyck. He read:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   In the last extremity--in the last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> phase when there is no longer any water</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> on the earth; when even the oxygen of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the atmospheric envelope has been re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> duced to minimum--man, or whatever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> form of intelligence is then upon the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> earth, must go back to the laws which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> governed his forebears. Necessity must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ever be the law of evolution. There will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> be no water upon the earth, but there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> will be an unlimited quantity elsewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    By that time, for instance, the great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> planet, Jupiter, will be in just a con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> venient state for exploitation. Gaseous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> now, it will be, by that time, in just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> about the stage when the steam and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> water are condensing into ocean. Eons</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of millions of years away in the days of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> dire necessity. By that time the intelli-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> gence and consciousness of the earth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> will have grown equal to the task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It is a thing to laugh at (perhaps)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> just at present. But when we consider</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the ratio of man's advance in the last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hundred years, what will it be in a bil-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lion? Not all the laws of the universe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> have been discovered, by any means.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At present we know nothing. Who can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tell?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Aye, who can tell? Perhaps we our-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> selves have in store the fate we would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mete out to another. We have a very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> dangerous neighbor close beside us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN WHO SAVED THE EARTH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">34</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars is in dire straits for water. And we</seg><seg type="columnLine">know there is life on Mars, and intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence! The very fact on its face pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claims it. The oceans have dried up;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only way they have of holding life</seg><seg type="columnLine">is by bringing their water from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">polar snow-caps. Their canals pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounce an advanced state of cooperative</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence; there is life upon Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in an advanced stage of evolution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But how far advanced? It is a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, and consequently eons of ages</seg><seg type="columnLine">in advance of ihe earth's evolution. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nature of things Mars cooled off</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, and life was possible there</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the earth was yet a gaseous mass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She has gone to her maturity and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her retrogression; she is approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">her end. She has had less time to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce intelligence than intelligence will</seg><seg type="columnLine">have--in the end--upon the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  How far has this intelligence pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressed? That is the question. Nature is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slow worker. It took eons of ages to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put life upon the earth ; Jt took eons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">more ages to make this life conscious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How far will it go? How far has it gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Mars?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">That was as far as the comments went,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'he professor dropped his eyes to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">;st of the paper. It was a map of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice of Mars, and across its center was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack cross scratched by the dull point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft pencil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew the face of Mars. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">.scraeus Lacus. The oasis at the juncture</seg><seg type="columnLine">f a series of canals running much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">ae spokes of a wheel. The great Uranian</seg><seg type="columnLine">nd Alander Canals coming in at about</seg><seg type="columnLine">ght angles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In two jumps the professor was in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">observatory with the great lens swung to</seg><seg type="columnLine">focus. It was the great moment out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lifetime, and the strangest and most</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager moment, perhaps, ever lived by any</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomer. His fingers fairly twitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">with tension. There before his view was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full face of our Martian neighbor!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But was it? He gasped out a breath of</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled exclamation. Was it Mars that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gazed at; the whole face, the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing had been changed before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mars has ever been red. Viewed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telescope it has had the most beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful tinge imaginable, red ochre, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird tinge of the desert in sunset. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">color of enchantment and of hell!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For it is so. We know that for ages</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ages the planet has been burning up;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that life was possible only in the dry sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottoms and under irrigation. The rest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the continents once were, was blaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing desert. The redness, the beauty, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enchantment that we so admired was burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this had changed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of this was a beautiful shade</seg><seg type="columnLine">of iridescent green. The red was gone for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. The great planet standing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens had grown into infinite glory. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great Dog Star transplanted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor sought out the Ascrseus</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lacus. It was hard to find. The whole face</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been transfigured; where had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">canals was now the beautiful sheen of green</seg><seg type="columnLine">and verdure. He realized what he was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding and what he had never dreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of seeing; the seas of Mars filled up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the stolen oceans our grim neighbor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come back to youth. But how had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">been done? It was horror for our world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The great luminescent ball of Opalescence!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe frozen and New York a mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice. It was the earth's destruction. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">long could the thing keep up; and whence</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it come from? What was it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sought for the Ascrseus Lacus. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he beheld a strange sight. At the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot where should have been the juncture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the canals he caught what at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like a pin-point flame, a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">twinkling light with flitting glow of opales-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cence. He watched it, and he wondered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed to the professor to grow; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he noticed that the green about it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a different color. It was winking, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great force, and as if alive; baneful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was what Charley Huyck had seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The professor thought of Charley. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried to the mountain. What could</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huyck, a mere man, do against a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this? There was naught to do but</seg><seg type="columnLine">sit and watch it drink of our life-blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then---</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the message, the strange assur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance that Huyck was flashing over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. There was no lack of confidence in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words he was speaking. "Celestial</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kinetics," so that was the answer! Cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly it must be so with the truth before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Williams was a doubter no longer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Charley Huyck could save them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man he had humored. Eagerly he waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stuck by the lens. The whole world</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS perhaps the most terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment since creation. To describe it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be like describing doomsday. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of us went through it, and we all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us thought the_ end had come; that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth was torn to atoms and to chaos.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The State of Colorado was lurid with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a red light of terror; for a thousand miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flame shot above the earth and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. If ever spirit went out in glory</seg><seg type="columnLine">that spirit was Charley Huyck! He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the moment and to Archimedes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The whole world rocked to the recoil. Com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pared to it the mightiest earthquake was</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a tender shiver. The consciousness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thsÂ»earth had spoken!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor was knocked upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. He knew not what had happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Out of the windows and to the north the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame of Colorado, like the whole world</seg><seg type="columnLine">going up. It was the last moment. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was a scientist to the end. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprained his ankle and his face was bleed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; but for all that he struggled, fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way to the telescope. And he saw:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great planet with its sinister, bale-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, wicked light in the center, and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">light vastly larger covering up half of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars. What was it? It was moving. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth set him almost to shouting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the answer of Charley Huyck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of the world. The light grew smaller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost a pin-point, on its way to Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The real climax was in silence. And of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the world only Professor Williams be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">held it. The two lights coalesced and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out; what it was on Mars, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, we do not know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in a few moments all was gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the green of the Martian Sea winked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sunlight. The luminous opal was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone from the Sargasso. The ocean lay in</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a terrible three days. Had it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been for the work of Robold and Huyck</seg><seg type="columnLine">life would have been destroyed. The pity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it is that all of their discoveries have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone with them. Not even Charley realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">how terrific was the force he was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to loosen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had carefully locked everything in</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaults for a safe delivery to man.

Rickey's father, D. B.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moyer, as a coal baron, turned a fearful</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of carbon into currency in the Pennsyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vania Alleghanies, and then died and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rickey alone to spend it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coal-grubbing never appealed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rickey. He finished a course at Amherst,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sold out the mines, and traveled. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have a consuming desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the world he was living in, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess that he has a speaking acquaintance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with most of it. He should have; for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started out when he was twenty-one years</seg><seg type="columnLine">old, and spent ten years globe-gallop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quite' suddenly he came home again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two years ago, built him a bungalow in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest on Black Bear Mountain above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old Moyer homestead in Center</seg><seg type="columnLine">County, and settled down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With him--and this is where i come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">--he brought Count Giuseppe Natali, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Florence. They had met somewhere in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Borneo. Both were cosmopolites, both</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearless. They had been through dangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">together in the Dyak country, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a friendship which stuck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I met the count for the first time last</seg><seg type="columnLine">summer at Palm Beach. Not to go into</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiresome details, we soon became engaged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Count Natali is a thoroughly delightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow, a gentleman to his slender finger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tips, and no fortune-hunter. Else he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have picked me; for I've none to men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, unless Aunt Caroline--but that has</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to do with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In January of this year Count Natali</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed to Italy to look after business con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected with his ancestral estate. I under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand that it is immense, and boasts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">among other attractions, an ancient feu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dal castle which makes one think of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">creepy old romance, "The Mysteries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Udoipho." On his return in early April,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rickey kidnaped him away from me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York and took him off to the Penn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sylvania wilds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon afterward came an invitation to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to come out for a fortnight, bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">my chum, Carrie Andrews, with Aunt Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oline for chaperon. Carrie was of my class</seg><seg type="columnLine">at college. We were both staying with Aunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caroline at Bayonne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All three of us thought that it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fine little outing--a sort of rest before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strenuosities of the summer season;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I at once wired Rickey that he was on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Naturally I wasn't sorrowful at the pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect of seeing Count Natali again so soon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had felt that I had rather a bone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick with Rickey for sequestrating my</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended as he had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rickey's haunt on Black Bear is no end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a quiet roost; and yet there are plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of possibilities to while away a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks, if one cares for them. There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SKY WOMAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent trout-fishing in Forge Run, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">one doesn't mind wading in hip-boots and</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting an occasional rattlesnake. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are a number of pleasant motor trips</seg><seg type="columnLine">one can take, if one doesn't mind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough roads and the hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I don't mind these things. I was born in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pennsylvania. So was Aunt Caroline, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't a bit fussy about such matters. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Carrie: she is one of those big, slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving, non-excitable blond creatures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom nothing ever seems to disturb. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">who would encounter an earthquake or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boa-constrictor with the same casual in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest she would bestow upon a new dance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very like Rickey himself, Carrie is.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LATE in the afternoon of April 17 we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were deposited from the up-train at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Viaduct, and saw the wooded spine of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black Bear looming above us across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley to the left of the tracks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Viaduct is little more than a signal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower, a tank, a row of laborers' shanty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shacks, and ten houses--personally I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't believe there are ten; but I am a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pennsylvanian, and I give Viaduct the</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit of a doubt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Count Natali met us with Rickey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">roadster; but Rickey was not with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aunt Caroline and Carrie were comfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tably discreet while the count greeted me</seg><seg type="columnLine">--much more so than a thin-faced woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">telegraph-operator, whom I saw watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">us with avid interest from the height of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her tower. Poor thing! How her eyes would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have popped had she known that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an honest-to-goodness Italian count who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was kissing me, or perhaps she did know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyhow, she watched, and the proceeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have her approval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My first reflection was that Count Nat*</seg><seg type="columnLine">ali both looked and felt much better with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his mustache. The coating of tan which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spring sun was overlaying on his olive</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks gave to his thin features the aspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an Indian chieftain or a Bedouin sheik.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A-hem!" said Aunt Caroline, after she</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Carrie had swept the skyline of Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bear for what she deemed a proper inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">val. "A-bem! And where is Richard?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your nephew asked me to make his</seg><seg type="columnLine">amends, Mme.

We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had a trifle of excitement."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire!" remarked Aunt Caroline, wrin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kling her nose and sniffing.

His tawny</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair was all topsyturvy and dark with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust, and his khakis and puttees were</seg><seg type="columnLine">smeared with soot and mud, not to men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion a black streak across the bridge of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">short nose, and numerous holes which</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying embers had scorched through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt and trousers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not contrast at all favorably</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Count Natali, who is always perfec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in his get-up. Though, in spite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt and disarray, Rickey still contrived to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look cool and efficient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Aunt Caroline and folkses all,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his welcome. He slipped into a chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as soon as decency would permit</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to eat like a hungry and hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Have I said that Rickey is a big fellow?</seg><seg type="columnLine">No?

The picture was compelling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rickey halted the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He jumped out and shouldered his blan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We followed him across the soft, crisp</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooring of ashes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Occasionally we passed smoking heaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the breeze would stir the embers so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that little spurts of flame leaped up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">38</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">danced like elves of mischief over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction they had done.

Through the lower rim of it work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men with picks and spades had dug a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">trenchlike passage to the stone itself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then had undermined it so that it had top-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pled from its first position- and lay along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trench.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the bottom of the dip the ashes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been cleared away, and a brisk wood fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">was burning, around which a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men sat upon logs. These were part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the section gang which the railroad had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent up to help Rickey fight the fire. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong aroma of coffee was grateful to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">noses after their long struggle with smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and soot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A stockily built man of middle age</seg><seg type="columnLine">detached himself from the group at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire as we came over the edge of the dip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He approached Rickey, an Irish brogue</seg><seg type="columnLine">issuing from his broad and exceedingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimy countenance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The dinnymite will be here directly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Misther Moyer," he said, removing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat.

I didn't wonder at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great hole it had torn in the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it struck, or the depth to which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had penetrated. The bottom of the socket</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which it had been tipped was nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a level with the floor of the dip. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">impact, I thought, must have jarred a</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable portion of the mountain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AGAINST the newly turned earth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excavation it contrasted darkly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its surface must recently have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">molten. I touched it with my fingers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it still was warm.

The upper end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as it lay, which had struck first was</seg><seg type="columnLine">splayed out and blunted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three of Mr. Conoway's men fetched</seg><seg type="columnLine">pine-knot torches and flashed their light</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the passage and the pit.

Yet it was not of our world. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">material evidence of other worlds beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">our ken. To me astronomy and kindred</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciences had appealed as largely guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. Here was evidence that the stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">were more than mere watchlights set to</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighten our dark ways.

Next to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our awe of time is our awe of distance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How many millions of miles had it fallen?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thought dizzied me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Isn't it fortunate that it did not strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon rock instead of earth?" said Carrie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SKY WOMAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing to its jammed and misshapen tip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Would have been one grand smash, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing left but flinders," remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rickey.

It shone like a mirrored</seg><seg type="columnLine">lakelet of jet. On each side of it arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">what at first glance seemed towering bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warks of the same ebon obsidian; at sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond revealed themselves as structures</seg><seg type="columnLine">hewn and set in place by men. Polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces pierced by dozens of high, narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows each ovaled with exquisite in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taglios of feathered serpent and the flower</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake that Lakla had called the Yekta</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and with whose kiss she had threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yolara.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down each facade a stairway fell, broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">by small landings on which a door opened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They dropped to a broad ledge of grayish</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone edging the lip of this midnight pool</seg><seg type="columnLine">and upon it also fell two wide flights from</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side of the bridge platform. Along</seg><seg type="columnLine">all four stairways the guards were ranged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And here and there against the ledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood the shells, in a curiously comforting</seg><seg type="columnLine">resemblance to parked motors in our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The somber walls bulked high; curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ended in two obelisked pillars. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">these, like a tremendous curtain stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">a barrier of that tenebrous gloom which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though weightless as shadow itself, I now</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew to be as impenetrable as the veil</seg><seg type="columnLine">between life and death. In this murk, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like all others I had seen, I sensed move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. A quivering, a tremor constant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythmic; not to be seen yet caught by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some subtle sense; as though through it</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat a swift pulse of--black light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the center of the pit of glittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, poised over the depths that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">like some frozen spring upwelling from</seg><seg type="columnLine">inky Styx itself, we hung for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The green dwarf turned the corial slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly to the edge at the right; crept cautious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly on toward where, not more than a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet from the barrier, a low, wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance opened in the fort. Guarding its</seg><seg type="columnLine">threshold stood two guards, armed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadswords, double handed, terminating</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a wide lunette mouthed with murder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous fangs. These they raised in salute and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the portal strode a dwarf huge as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rador, dressed as he and carrying only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poniard that was the badge of office</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Muria's captainry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho, Rador!" he hailed, merrily.

"Why, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">handmaiden passed with her Akka nigh a</seg><seg type="columnLine">va ago!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Passed!"

But under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green dwarf's stern gaze the truculence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the guardian faded. "Why should I</seg><seg type="columnLine">not?" he asked, apprehensively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because Yolara commanded otherwise,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered Rador, coldly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There came no command to me."

The light, too, had changed; gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the dancing, sparkling atoms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silver had faded to a soft, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashen grayness. Ahead of us marched a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rampart of coppery cliffs, rising like"-all</seg><seg type="columnLine">these mountainous walls we had seen, into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the immensities of haze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something long drifting in my subcon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness turned to startled realization.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The speed of the shell was slackening!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The aperture containing the ionizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism was still open; I glanced within.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The whirling ball of fire Was not dimmed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but its coruscations, instead of pouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">down through the cylinder, swirled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eddied and shot back as though trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to re-enter their source.

Faintly behind us</seg><seg type="columnLine">came shoutings, and we knew that Lugur</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew close.

Under the shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finely balanced machine, almost floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">in air through its projectile speed, swerved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its course. It struck the soft, low</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank of the road, shot high in air, bounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">on through the thick carpeting, whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a dervish and fell upon its side.

It stopped abruptly, was cut off by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slab of polished crimson stone a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet high, and as wide, set within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coppery face of the barrier. On each side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it stood pillars, cut from the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock and immense, almost, as those which</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the rainbow veil of the Dweller.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Across its face weaved unnameable carv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, but I had no time for more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glance.

Thirty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide they were at their widest, then drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward each other with no break in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">symmetry; they did not close. Above was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly, a ten-foot rift, ragged edged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which poured light like that in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of pale amber, a buttercup light</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot through with curiously evanescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronze shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under the feet the path gave with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">resiliency like hard rubber or well-rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">turf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was ridged--rippled--these ripples</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foot apart and flanked by deep, sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">indentations, clean cut as though drilled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just such a tunnel, it came to me, as would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made by a huge metal ball belted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long, toothed strip and sent rolling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific force through some compressible</seg><seg type="columnLine">material such as, for instance, some types</seg><seg type="columnLine">of moss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick!" commanded Rador, uneasily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and set off at a sharp pace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MOSS.

How many countless times</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the past, with nose pressed flat against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flawless quartz plate, his childish eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wondering mind had struggled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp the meaning of this abysm around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a child of eight he had stood at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">same port-window, certain that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the universe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This had been the only world he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">really known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had memories of that other world</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he had lived to the age of four,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was a dream world. A strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairyland world in which you walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around in a ship so big that you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see the ceiling. And there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enormous, brilliant lamp up high that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they moved over your head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they had hidden this big lamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the floor at bedtimes, the big cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become dark. No, not always dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remembered. Sometimes they had hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">out another, softer lamp, one with a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">face on it. They had called it the Moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. The bright one was the Sun-light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then there had been the Star-lights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, at night, such as he could see from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this smaller cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that was a dream-world, faded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory. This smaller cabin, surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by Star-lights, was real. This had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the child Dave Standish's world for</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, and he had not questioned its exist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence or reason. No more than a child of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight on Earth would have questioned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence of Earth, or his life on it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had asked questions, of course, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been idle ones of purely childish</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity. But after the age of eight, deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions rose in his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chronometer in the main cabin had</seg><seg type="columnLine">clicked on steadily. The hours grew into</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, the days into years. A twelve year</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Dave Standish had stood before this</seg><seg type="columnLine">same port-window and suddenly realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a ship was something that went some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. Dr. Roscoe, in the role of teacher,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had begun on the history and geography</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Earth, and the groundwork of science.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave Standish slowly realized that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other "ship" had been something more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a ship. It took him many, many</seg><seg type="columnLine">months of thoughtful reasoning to finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept the truth. The other "ship" had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a large world, tremendously larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more complex in all its phases than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was able to conceive at first! He real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized the Star-lights were no longer little</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamps hung just around the ship. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were big, blazing suns scattered far and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And their ship was not hanging motion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly. It was moving among these suns--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rrmE grown-up Dave Standish, thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">A and staring out at the stars, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">still remember the thrill of his sixteenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">birthday. On that day Dr. Roscoe had</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkened the cabin and given him his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first taste of talking and moving pictures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They became an important part of Dave's</seg><seg type="columnLine">life in the next few years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once he had run through the hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reels there were, he re-ran them again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again. His narrow, iron-bound world</seg><seg type="columnLine">peopled itself with fantoms that became</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost real as he viewed them over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost but not quite. It was a strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">new world to Dave Standish, one before</seg><seg type="columnLine">which there was always a cloud. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never understand it fully till he saw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his own eyes. He sighed when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the remoteness of that event.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That it was a stupendous journey they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on, Dave Standish had come to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alize, as his practical knowledge increased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first he had taken it for granted. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now he realized what powerful engines the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship had, to achieve half the speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. The builders had had to design an</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">engine and ship to carry two passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost twenty thousand times as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance from Earth to Pluto.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This entailed a proportionate increase</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fuel and food, to last for almost a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half century. In the earthly scale of</seg><seg type="columnLine">monetary value, the ship was as costly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a small war. Certainly the motive be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind its launching must be gravely im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant, he had reflected many times. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire project was for getting him, Dave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Standish, to some destination and back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything had been planned to the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail for that end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To what detail Dave only realized when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Roscoe told him he -had been chosen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for perfect health and strong mind, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of other children. And before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been put aboard the ship, doctors</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given him a mild attack of each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the childhood diseases, for the purpose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">filling his blood with the natural anti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies. Every precaution had been taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">to increase his chances of surviving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long trip into the void.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But just why the trip, and where were</seg><seg type="columnLine">they going? That had been the great mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery. On his twenty-first birthday, Dave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Standish was to be told.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before that time came, Dr. Roscoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a siege of weakness and sank fast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He grew gaunt and thin. He had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">shunned the port-windows. His staring eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed ever to have a lurking terror in</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He did not like to look out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">abysmal space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave, bringing his thoughts now to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent past, was not quite sure what Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roscoe had died from.

Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned off the engines that had performed</seg><seg type="columnLine">such prodigious labors, and ran to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest port-window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an hour he gazed out, lost in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring trance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time in twenty-two Â«*ears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rp was on a world.

But his best imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never pictured for his adult mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a world was really like.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt utterly bewildered.

He stooped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground and picked up a handful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt and grass, letting it trickle through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers.

Finally a fall being stepped forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spoke.

All the women began talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly to one another and looking from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to the violet-eyed girl. Finally the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who had tried to speak to him went</seg><seg type="columnLine">smilingly to the girl, took her hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">led her close to Dave, giving him the hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave felt a new, terrifying rapture tingle</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his nerves at that contact. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand was warm, soft, clinging. The violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were close now, and in them, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a strange light. Dave could not realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">it then, but by the custom of this ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">triarchal civilization, he had already been</seg><seg type="columnLine">married to the violet-eyed girl, in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Their human relationships, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to learn, were far simpler than those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Earth. But Dave knew nothing of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">things at the time. He knew only that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted the violet-eyed girl more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything else in the universe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl now tugged at his hand, to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the city. Dave went along, unresist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and the two were followed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great crowd that had come to see the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crowd sang. Dave was led through</seg><seg type="columnLine">their arboreal city, lit by warm sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine and perfumed by the thousands of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">varieties of flowers which bordered every</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk. There was no clap-trap of cars, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicles of any kind, nor any noise. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">any earthly comparison, it was a Utopian</seg><seg type="columnLine">city with laughing, happy inhabitants and</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple but magnificent surroundings. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a completely unmechanical civilization,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blessed by a kind climate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> People that passed stared curiously at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange, tall man with drab clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they smiled, too. Dave found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling back, though it hurt the muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his mouth. He had not smiled for five</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, in the ship. At last the violet-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl led him into a tiny house. She turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the door to wave at the crowd and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it dispersed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they were alone together, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked into one another's eyes and spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">a language that made no use of words.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the violet-eyed girl laughed, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man from space laughed with her. She dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared into another room to come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a heaping bowl of strange, luscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruits. They ate, laughing in each other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TIME passed with the swiftness of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful dream for Dave Standish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He learned their simple language quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and soon came to know what an idyllic</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence the woman-ruled civilization of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this planet was. He "knew a happiness, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his simple life with Tara, his wife, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had always subconsciously hungered</seg><seg type="columnLine">for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he tried to explain to her his</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence on their world, he became con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused. All that had passed before in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous life was a forgotten dream. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">even lost curiosity in the great ship in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had come. It was still there</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had landed it, viewed daily by</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of people of this garden planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Rendora.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At times, Dave would have a disturbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling that he should remember some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in connection with the ship. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to do with the man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once lived in it with him. They had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from another world, where he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">SON OF THE STARS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">born, and he was supposed to go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some reason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave was quite clear in one part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind what it was all about, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another part of his mind, the whole thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed inconsequential. What did that</seg><seg type="columnLine">world mean to him, so far away in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">void? He had barely lived on it a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. Its troubles were no concern of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his. He had never really been a part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that world, had never understood what</seg><seg type="columnLine">its complex life was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Rendora was a world he could un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand. One that he belonged in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daily, he went out into the fields with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tara and the others, and tilled their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bountiful soil. Rendora had no severe</seg><seg type="columnLine">winters and gathered harvests all through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the year. At night, in the city, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">music and dancing, and gaiety and friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship and comfort. .There were no wars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or struggles, no tyranny, misadjustments or</seg><seg type="columnLine">poverty. Everyone had a place in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">life and everyone was happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What could draw Dave back to a world</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty-six trillion miles away? One whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">salient features had been warfare, suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fering, misery and a terrible, never-un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstandable complexity. One part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dave's mind knew a word called "duty,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">but no part of his mind could interpret</seg><seg type="columnLine">that word into human terms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day, when he had lived almost a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year on Rendora, Tara revealed a secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a shining light in her eyes. Dave</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt almost weak at the news. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited the event eagerly, happier than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day came, and Dave Standish felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though the universe had crashed about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head when the news was delivered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. In a blind panic, he went to see for</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. There it was, an ugly, hairy little</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature with an apelike face, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">little grunting sounds! Tara was weeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though she would never stop, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dumfounded, unbelieving, Dave stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his offspring. Then suddenly it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, like a bolt of lightning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doom of Earth!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How had he hoped to escape it? For</seg><seg type="columnLine">he too had been bathed by that unfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunate cosmic ray process that had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed the regulating hormone of evolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. By the progressive Mendelian laws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he knew to the last letter, he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have two normal babies out of ten, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others would be like this and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insane mutants Dr. Roscoe had told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">about!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was a living symbol of the doom</seg><seg type="columnLine">that faced all Earth, and in his sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">anguish, Dave realized what the doom</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to Earth people. Millions like</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, back there on Earth, had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">through this same turmoil that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be tearing his soul to shreds. And mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions more would, till Earth was eventu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally tenantless by true man entirely, pop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulated only by vast hordes of sub-crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures and horrible mutants. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doom that Dr. Roscoe had tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">impress him with and which up till now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dave had not been able to sympathize</seg><seg type="columnLine">with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Earth's mankind was doomed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unless--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave Standish suddenly sprang from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">moaning wife's bedside and ran all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the ship, arriving half dead with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatigue. He climbed the steps and ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the central cabin. Feverishly he pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a notebook from what had been Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roscoe's desk and read its contents. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">words would have had little meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him an hour before. Now they did--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful, glorious meaning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave ran back to the city, stood him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self on the steps of the central building</seg><seg type="columnLine">and addressed the crowd that quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered as his male voice thundered over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd of women. For an hour he</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked and knew that the ruling matriarchs</seg><seg type="columnLine">above, on the balconies, were also listen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he had finished, most of the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">were weeping, and Dave knew that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have no trouble. He shouted in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structions and a great mass of them fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him to his ship. He ran to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply rooms and hauled out crated mech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">78</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">anisms with which he drew a pint of blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">from each person. With the willing help</seg><seg type="columnLine">of others, this blood was sealed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting cans that had been made on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth for that purpose. Thousands of cans</seg><seg type="columnLine">were filled in the next day, till there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This life-blood of one world, given to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, would save Earth, for in it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained traces of the subtle hormone</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost to human life. The hormone that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made all the difference in the universe be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween wild, unbridled evolution and nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal life. Earth's eager chemists would</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolate that hormone that had been com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely destroyed on Earth through folly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would manufacture it in huge quan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tities, to be given to all Earth people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that was in Dr. Roscoe's notebook.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he had not even known if such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet could be found with an evolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to Earth's. And he had not known</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Dave Standish, finding it, would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin carrying out this project until driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it by the finger of fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave did not waste a minute. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cans had all been filled, sealed and stored</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ship, he prepared immediately for</seg><seg type="columnLine">take-off. He was leaving Rendora, a world</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would never see again, and in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been supremely content. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving Tara, and knew that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never again love another woman. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving happiness itself. But he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tara begged to come along, no matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the sacrifice. But Dave, with a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisdom, forbade it. Her mind would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand the harshness of a trip through</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty void for twenty-two years. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, nurtured and inured by the void al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready, could do it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His ship soared up and away, glinting</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly in a yellow sunlight that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not again shine on it for twenty-two years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rendora dwindled and Dave Standish felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though he had left his soul behind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But within himself he felt a deep, calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction. Earth's prodigal son was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning, though he had been a son of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars for most of his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWENTY-TWO years and four months</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, the giant pancake ship lowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sight of it opened a wound in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dave's heart, by its very resemblance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rendora, the paradise he had left to ful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill his mission. Dave Standish was forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine years old now, his hair streaked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray. Forty-four of those years had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent in harsh space. Yet Dave could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel bitter at this sacrifice of his normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. The tremendous importance of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey was now clear to him. That grunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, hairy little creature born to Tara--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He only hoped and prayed it wasn't too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late, for Earth. The false mutation had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had almost fifty years full play. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that time humanity's numbers had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly depleted. They had probably main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained a rigid birth-control, to keep from</seg><seg type="columnLine">spawning more and more of the unde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sired mutants. He would save them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By use of an old map, Dave was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to orientate himself over the world he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seen except with childish eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">four. He picked out New York City and</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed on its huge Long Island space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drome. Attendants ran up to his ship when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had turned off the hot blasts, and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan fastening hooks to drag it out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of other descending craft. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy place. Dave was rather amazed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had hardly expected to see this</seg><seg type="columnLine">much activity in a race faced with extinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Dozens of ships were being loaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unloaded. Figures scurried by cease-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as Dave opened his hatch, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted aloud in pure exuberance at being</seg><seg type="columnLine">back safe and sound, and with the means</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hands of saving mankind. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shouted above the noises to the atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dants below, who didn't seem to notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ship was any different from the hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of others that came and went in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interplanetary trade routes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm Dave Standish!

His bulging cranium and lofty</seg><seg type="columnLine">brow, fully twice that of an average</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's, gave him a severely intellectual</seg><seg type="columnLine">look.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other penalty, namely the Valley of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howling Rocks, supplied a most diabol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical form of punishment.

However, my wishes finally pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vailed, and Doggo promised to try and</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure the valley punishment, in event of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a conviction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In due course the time arrived for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trial, and I was led in chains to the Im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perial City.

As she is reported to have ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, "Why, you're nothing but a pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cards!" so I was often tempted to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim, "Why, you're nothing but a nest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ants!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a matter of fact, I was much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested in how my princess was getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on than I was in my own impending fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the day of the trial I was led into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the awful presence of Queen Formis. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood nearly twice the size of any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Formian, and her dignity was enhanced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a raised platform surmounted by a scarlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">canopy, which well set off the perfect pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portions of her jet-black body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grouped on each side of her stood six</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant-men, whose refined and intelligent ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance made even my professorial friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the University of Mooni look like com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon worker ants by comparison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ant messengers hurried to and fro, do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the bidding of the dread thirteen; w'hile</seg><seg type="columnLine">several large clumsy ants, of a type which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had never seen before, wandered aim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly about the chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Royal Husbands," Doggo informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So these were the drones of Formia.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were very stupid looking fellows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who appeared to be accorded great privi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leges but no deference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MY JAILERS led me to the foot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throne, where, under instructions</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Doggo, I made a low obeisance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the queen.

On the whole, the procedure seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">much fairer than a trial on earth. Fwr the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">evident object here was to ascertain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole truth, unhampered by rules of evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence, rather than to afford a sparring</seg><seg type="columnLine">match between rival attorneys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The keeper of the kerkoOl-ool at Wau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toosa testified in substance as follows:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The prisoner came at me unawares, over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came me, and trussed me up in a corner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it took me a parth and a half to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape from my bonds. While I lay bound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cabot stole Prince Yuri's car. I saw no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one with Cabot, and in fact did not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cabot take the car, but I judge that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it, for I later found it gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I object!"

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a well-framed-up story, and I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclination to get the keeper of the ker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kool-ool into trouble by disputing it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The traffic sentinel ant gave an exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">and straightforward account of how he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped us and had trapped me into many</seg><seg type="columnLine">damaging statements. Also how I had tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run him down with the kerkool, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not exactly the truth; but doubtless</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had seemed that way to him. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced the forged pass, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed around and carefully inspected by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the council.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several ant-men then testified as to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuit of us, including the wrecking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own car by means of ours. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to dig into the tunnel and had failed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so they had killed the spider with a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole.

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, they had slipped up by not realizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that I possessed the sense of hearing, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had enabled me to avoid the patrols.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Cupian sentinel at the Third Gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">had claimed his official privilege of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusing to testify, but the ant sentinel</seg><seg type="columnLine">quoted his Cupian colleague as saying that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had let the Princess Lilia pass through</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he had no authority over members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the royal family, but had duly arrested</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as required by law. No mention was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of Prince Yuri's presence at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate to "rescue" her from me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried to get Doggo to object on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground of hearsay, for this was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only attempt by the prosecution at</seg><seg type="columnLine">identifying my companion in flight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hence was most damaging; but Doggo re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied that hearsay testimony was perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowable on Poros, unless one could im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peach either the absent or the present wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. How much more sensible than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rule in America!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I was called upon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do I have to take the stand?"

But my New England</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit of fair play deterred me, and I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to settle with Yuri myself and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonally; though how I ever hoped to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ants, in order to do so, I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop to consider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I spoke as follows: "Everything testi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied so far is the truth.

But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for myself, I was still unable to get up</seg><seg type="columnLine">any very great excitement over the affair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps I am a fatalist, but I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that I was really going to die. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">all seemed like a dream from which I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon about to awake. And even if I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">appear to die on this planet, was it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely that I would awake on the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">again in my Boston laboratory, and thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">put an end to a very interesting set of</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginary adventures?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at this thought a pang stabbed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, and I resolved that I had rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually die than have it turn out that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting with the Princess Lilia had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The authorities permitted me to write</seg><seg type="columnLine">her a note of farewell, and Doggo guar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anteed to deliver it personally, thus assur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that it would get past Yuri. Into this</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter I crowded all my pent-up love, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">urged her to feel no regrets at my having</seg><seg type="columnLine">been sacrificed in her behalf, as that sacri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fice was gladly and happily given.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I patted my little pet Tabby fare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, turned her over to Doggo's care, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was led by my executioners to the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the abyss. It was a harmless enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking gulch, but the scores of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeletons and ant shells, scattered about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom, bore mute witness to its dread</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And witness, not mute, was borne by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the volume of noise which rolled up over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the valley. I had thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had heard the limit of stupendous sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">when years ago I stood at the brink of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Niagara, but the roar which arose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Valley of the Howling Rocks dwarfed</seg><seg type="columnLine">even Niagara by comparison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And into this chaos infernal I was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be lowered. It was of .course impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear spoken farewells, so I patted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of Doggo's head good-by, at which</seg><seg type="columnLine">last demonstration he turned away broken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearted. But the others seemed to be thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughly enjoying the spectacle. Then my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shackles were removed, so as to give free</seg><seg type="columnLine">play to my amusing antics during the tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, a strong rope was placed under my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, and I was lowered into the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as I passed over the edge, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts consisted chiefly in wondering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not what fate was in store for me, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather what it was that made the noise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Always I shall remain an inquisitive-scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist, I suppose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The noise became unbearable. Looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward as the ropes spun me around, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the horrid face of the ant queen, leer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over the edge. She lifted up a paw. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">my surprise, the Formians who held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes began to raise me again.

In falling I had knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head against a stone and had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last I gradually came to; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first thing that I noticed, and that brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">me out of my stupor with a jerk, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that absolute silence reigned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat up and looked around. Yes, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still in the same valley, surrounded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitened bones and rusted carapaces. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oppressive din had ceased. Had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">death-dealing howls been purely an arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial creation, and had they been turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">off at my supposed decease?</seg><seg type="columnLine">86</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC, MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My late executioners had gone, so I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">free to escape, if escape were possible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But first I wished to find out why the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise had stopped. Ever the incorrigible</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist! So I arose to my feet, and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly noticed that my headset was off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was trailing on the ground. It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been knocked off when my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was just about to replace the phones</seg><seg type="columnLine">over my ears, when I heard a roar pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeding from them. And then I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the awful sound for which the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">was famous was not sound at all, but con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted merely in radiations of some sort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been caught and translated into</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound by my radio apparatus. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">some advantages, after all, in my possessing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a different kind of sense of hearing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that prevalent on Poros.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I switched off my current, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced my headset. The next problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to get out of the valley. Not being</seg><seg type="columnLine">confused by the howling roar, I had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage over the many victims who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">preceded me. Undoubtedly it was this</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite natural confusion which had rendered</seg><seg type="columnLine">it impossible for victims in the past to</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb the walls, and so had given these</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls their undeserved reputation for un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scalability. Even as it was, quite a while</seg><seg type="columnLine">elapsed before I found sufficient crevices</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveniently placed, so that I could make</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way to the top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally I stood at the rim, a free man!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then I voluntarily went back down</seg><seg type="columnLine">again into that valley of death. Why? Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause, being primarily an inquisitive scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist, I wanted to procure samples of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">howling rocks, for purposes of analysis if</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever I should be in a laboratory again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So I collected several different kinds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments and did them up in a knotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of my toga.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more I scaled the steep walls, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood again at the rim. I was free! No</seg><seg type="columnLine">one would ever look for me, as I was of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficially dead. I could pass as a Cupian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my disguise was still intact, and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">freshly shaved that morning so as to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a presentable corpse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Life on Poros was ahead of me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poros held the Princess Lilia!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The only fly in the ointment was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had lost my sense of direction, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know whether I now stood on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Formian or on the Cupian side of the pale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Accordingly, I proceeded with caution.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After skirting the Valley of the Howling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocks, I followed the pale, hoping to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come at last to some gate which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">'furnish a clue as to which side I was on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A strong wind was blowing, as is usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Poros, and I knew that of course it</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew toward the sea. But, as I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know whether the sea lay east or west</seg><seg type="columnLine">from here, the wind was of no assistance</seg><seg type="columnLine">in enabling me to orient myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The pale was a thirty-foot sheer wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of glazed concrete, running in practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">a geodesic line across the country, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times through woods and sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">through green fields.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where it ran through the woods, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees and bushes along it--at least on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side which I was on--had been cut away</seg><seg type="columnLine">for quite a wide swath, evidently for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose of preventing any one from using</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to surmount the walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As I could see no one on top of the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">in either direction, I followed this cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, which made traveling considerably</seg><seg type="columnLine">more easy. There was no fear of detection</seg><seg type="columnLine">except when I passed'through open fields,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I had to do this quite frequently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  One field contained a herd of the milk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving aphids, which I had nicknamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">"green cows." Their presence convinced me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I must still be in Formia, until I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected that I did not know but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cupians also raised them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last I came to a road which ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">along by the pale for a way and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved off again. Down this road I walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I saw ahead of me, where the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">topped a slight rise, two ant-men coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward me. Instantly I concealed myself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tartan bush at one side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOON I heard their approach; and, sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly noticing that I cou'd not hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">their voices. I switched on my apparatus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been disconnected ever since I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had replaced my headset in the Valley of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Howling Rocks. Thanks to my Inde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structo tube, the apparatus was still intact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now a strange low growl almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned out what they were saying, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that with difficulty I distinguished the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following words: "I could swear that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a Cupian approaching on the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of us; but now he is nowhere to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the other said: "Never mind what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you saw. Do you hear what I hear? We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had better be on our guard, for it sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the roar of some absolutely new and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange animal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It sounds to me," replied the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"more like the awful Valley, only much</seg><seg type="columnLine">softer. It seems to come from this tartan</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush. Shall we investigate?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he mentioned the valley, I instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized what was the cause of the trouble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The radioactive fragments tied up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of my toga had revealed my pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. If I wanted to escape, I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave my precious samples behind. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sigh I undid the knot, dropped the pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground, and dashed out through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the bush, just as the ant-men broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">in through the front of it. It was lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me that my pursuers had no ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of hearing, or they would have heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">my departure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Safe in another bush, I listened to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed remarks at finding the stones. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after puzzling and debating for some time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they finally resumed their journey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was about to return for my specimens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I reflected that they might attract</seg><seg type="columnLine">other attention, and might even serve as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clue to suggest that I was a convict,</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped from the awful valley, so I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luctantly left them lying where they were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of continuing along the road,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, I now retraced my steps to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, for the presence of the ant-men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made me certain that I was still in Formia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hence it became necessary for me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find some place where I could get through</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other side. Accordingly, I proceeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">along beside the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day was warm and moist, as are all</seg><seg type="columnLine">days on Poros, but as I went on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather got hotter, damper and more op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressive. Finally the sky began to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aha!" said I. "Now it is evening, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shall be able to get my bearings by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink light in the west."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But no pink light appeared on any hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Never before had I seen a night descend</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this upon this planet. Then with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash the sky was split in two by a living</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame, and the storm broke in all its fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roar of the thunder was like a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuous artillery barrage. Spiral vorticles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wind hurled the rain in my face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly twisted me off my feet, as I an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chored myself to a tree trunk to withstand</seg><seg type="columnLine">its fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But fortunately the storm was as brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was severe, and soon I was again</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing on beneath silver skies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In spite of the storm, the weather kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">on getting more and more oppressive, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til, on cresting a hill, I saw before me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of all the trouble. About two stads</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead there rose a solid wall of vapor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretching away to the horizon on each</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and to the silver clouds above, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving forth such an intense heat in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction that I could scarcely bear it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every now and then a few drops of scald-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing water would fall on me from above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This must be the Boiling Sea, of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had heard so much and which surrounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">all continental Poros. It was an impressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pale ended only about a stad ahead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet for the life of me I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">summon up courage enough to try and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass around its end. In fact, I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceive how the wall ever could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been built even that far, in the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that terrific heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later I learned that it had been built</seg><seg type="columnLine">little by little behind a huge screen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">woven fire-worm fur, and only during off-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore breezes at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, there was nothing for me to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">but turn around and retrace my steps, back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Valley of the Howling Rocks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond, in search for an opening through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My earthly ears caught the sound of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching kerkool, and as the road was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunately passing through the woods at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time, I hid myself in a convenient tar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tan bush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this time I displaced one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge leaves sufficiently so that, with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye, I could cover the road. What was my</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy to note, as the car passed, that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Cupian make and held Cupians!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN the kerkool was safely out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight and hearing, I resumed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">march, and soon came in view of a city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a type so different from any which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had previously seen on Poros that it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">well have belonged to another world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat down in a hillside pasture beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road, amidst gently grazing aphids,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gazed upon the beautiful sight. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">city was set, upon a rounded hill. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very summit stood a group of monumental</seg><seg type="columnLine">white buildings, ornamented with domes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">minarets and stately columns. From this</seg><seg type="columnLine">group down to the foot of the hill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the plain toward where I sat there</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched a plaza of well kept silver sward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flanked by walks and ornamental trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The road ran square to the nearer edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this park, where it forked abruptly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirted both sides of the lawn. Flanking</seg><seg type="columnLine">this divided road, and extending around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base of the hill, stood a multitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses; gray concrete or stucco, 'with high</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched red tile roofs. Nothing more differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent from the ant cities to which I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed could be imagined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That I was at last in Cupia, the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try of my princess, there could now be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">question. And, as if to resolve my last</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible doubt, night now fell, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink sky on my left assured me that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, in truth, north of the pale and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hated country of my captivity lay far</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the silver gray faded overhead, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that I had had nothing to eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">since a condemned man's conventional</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearty meal early that morning. So, util-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> izing the few remaining minutes of day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, I fashioned a tartan leaf into a rude</seg><seg type="columnLine">cup and filled it with green milk from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contented cows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, laying my weary body upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground and covering myself 'with tartan</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves, I turned in for the night and slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the healthy sleep of utter exhaustion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next morning I awakened greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">refreshed, and after breakfasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the friendly aphids, set off to enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beautiful city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	was badly in need of a shave and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">toga was mussed and soiled. But my dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guise was still intact, and without too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny I might still pass as a Cupian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet I did not dare ask where I was, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing what the Cupian customs might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be with regard to strangers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My first desire 'was to procure a shav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing knife and a clean toga, but I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea how to go about it. In Formia there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been no shops; everything necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">had simply been "issued," as in the army,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but without even the need of signing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">receipt. But quite likely the Cupian cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom was different.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, too, I wanted lodgings and a job,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but did not know how to go about this</seg><seg type="columnLine">either.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately, however, I overheard a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation between two Cupians which gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a clue as to ho'w to proceed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yahoo, Jodek," one of them hailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other. "How is it that you are in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kuana today?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My heart gave a bound. Kuana, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">capital city of Cupia, and home of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">princess! Fate was indeed repaying me</seg><seg type="columnLine">well for all the hard knocks it had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The one addressed as Jodek answered:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have walked in from Ktuth to register</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a job here in Kuana. Can you direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to the Ministry of Work?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the two friends walked away, chat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting together, while the germ of an idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprouted in my mind. I too would be from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ktuth, looking for a job.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Occasionally I passed some very offici-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIOMAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">- 89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ous looking person armed with a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadsword.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I assumed these were pinquis, or Poro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vian policemen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, when I felt sure that Jodek had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had plenty of time in which to report, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached one of these policemen, told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that I was from Ktuth, and asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the way to the Ministry of Work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too bad about all the trouble at Ktuth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't it?" said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I assented vaguely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think that it was the fault</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Count Kamel?" he continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was getting entirely too garrulous</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was likely at any moment to trap me</seg><seg type="columnLine">into some damaging slip.

And at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant he too saw me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Let me digress for a moment. I find that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in writing down this account of my adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures I frequently use earth words instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the more exact Porovian synonym. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have just said "count" and "duke," al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though these words are not strictly ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curate. I might have said "barsarkar" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"sarkar" instead; but I believe that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearer impression will be created on my (</seg><seg type="columnLine">readers--if this manuscript ever reaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earth--by occasionally using Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">words where this does not involve too great</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stretch in their meaning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, as I was saying: Here, to my sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise and horror, came the last person on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poros whom I desired to see, namely Prince</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yuri. Each of us was equally astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the other, but Yuri "was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">to recover his presence of mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pinqui," he shouted peremptorily to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cupian policeman, "arrest that man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and take him to the mang-ool. I myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">will answer to the mango. And tell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mango that I forbid conversation with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, turning to me with a smile, Yuri</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Welcome to Kuana, my friends You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are as welcome here as a spot of sunlight,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and have just as bad a habit of turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. The last I heard of you, you were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demned to death. How you escaped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ant-men I know not, but perhaps you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will find that Cupian justice is surer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Formian."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then to the officer, as I started to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply: "Pinqui, if he says a word to me, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, or to any one, strike him on the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tennae! I have spoken."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he strode majestically away, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinqui seized me roughly by the arm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">led me to the mang-ool, or jail, of the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Kuana.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the mang-ool the pinqui turned me</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to the mango, to whom he repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yuri's message, whereupon I noticed a pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culiar yindictive expression creep across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jailer's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I was led to a cell and locked in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once more I was out of luck. A few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes ago I had been free, and full of joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">at finding myself in the city of my prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess; now I was in the toils again, and--</seg><seg type="columnLine">'what was worse--in the power of the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was my deadly rival for Lilia's hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and who, for aught that I knew, was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready betrothed to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At all events, he was the most powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">single individual in all Cupia, next to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle the king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was certainly in a jam!

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently Poblath was greatly given to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Porovian proverbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About one parth (or Porovian hour),</seg><seg type="columnLine">later the mango brought Prince Yuri to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my cell.

"The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient law applies equally to animals, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you well know, my prince.

The king was a broad shouldered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow hipped, athletic figure, looking like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a well preserved earth-man of about fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of age. His complexion was bronzed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nose slightly aquiline, and his hair iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray, short and furry.

I chose</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poblath, and Yuri chose one of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">suite. A ,peculiar harness was then pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced, consisting of a double belt. .One</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of this was buckled around Yuri's</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist; but when they came to buckle me</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the other half, my radio apparatus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was concealed beneath my toga,</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnished an obstacle, and so there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing for me to do but take it off. This,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, would render me entirely deaf</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the fight, which fact might prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat disadvantageous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before they took away my hearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">they explained fully to me just how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">duel would be conducted.

However, I soon perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these Porovian duels are not to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">won by strength alone. There were tricks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feints by which one's opponent could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be tired out.

A gleam of exultation filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eye of my opponent. The point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knife pricked my breast, and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter. In a few seconds it would be over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I should fall a victim of an alien race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A strange train of ideas ran through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">affrighted mind: "Alien race.

The time was appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently the next morning. My first thought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was to worry about Lilia. My next was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wonder who was to blame for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">seizure. Yuri, undoubtedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, if so, had he not misplayed? If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had let me alone, I should by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time be marrying the Sarkari Bthuh; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">once married to her, I coidd no longer in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terfere between Lilia, and Yuri, who might</seg><seg type="columnLine">even consent to marry the princess out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pique.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My thoughts were interrupted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">return of my captor, who proved to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ant-man, numbered 356-1-400. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a young ant, and bore no duel numbers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I started to speak, but he warned me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be silent; to make sure of my obedience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he bit me savagely. Once more, as on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">first day on this planet, I experienced in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense pain, followed by oblivion, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">by conscious paralysis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I awoke paralyzed, I found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my captor was carrying me. The fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was an ant-man confirmed my suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cions of Yuri. But the fact that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying me furtively through the woods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of on the main highway, convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that I was still in Cupia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My bonds were still on, but had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">very loose. Immediately I decided that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">one chance of escape lay in concealing my</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovery from the paralysis, when this re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery should occur. So I awaited my op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus we proceeded for about a parth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a half, when suddenly my . captor</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted and pricked up his antennae. I too</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened. Directly ahead of us there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long-drawn howl, the call of a woofus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nearer came the sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were in a field at the time, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that the ant-man Was looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">around for a likely tree, in which to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuge. But the bordering woods were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrub, with not a single sizable tree in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight, so my captor laid me down and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced toward the sound of the oncoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">woofus, evidently determined to bluff it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and to attack before being attacked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the purple terror bounded into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open. One lone ant-man is no match for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woofus. My captor fought bravely, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">\</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he was slowly driven back, contesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">every parastad of the way. When the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">were nearly upon me, I realized that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">languor was gone. I undid my bonds. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood erect. Then I found a heavy stick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My captor was entirely engrossed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his conflict. Now was my chance to crush</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with my club, and then escape while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woofus devoured his remains. Fate was</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed kind to me once more. So I crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealthily forward, and then brought my</seg><seg type="columnLine">club down with a crash on the head of--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woofus. For my sense of fair play,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my sporting sense, had abruptly changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind, and I had rescued the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog, instead of killing him. Now I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">again his captive, undoubtedly destined this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to have eggs laid in me by Queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Formis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The ant-man stood for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounded, and then wheeled around. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">still held my club. There was now. no rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son why I should not kill him too, if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could. But he did not charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead he said: "Let us not fight.

The straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">line was easy, as the eastern sky was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly pink; and likewise it was easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to head north along the road, when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally reached one. But when at last I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a city, it turned out to be Ktuth</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than Kuana.	**r&gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEFORE seeking food or anything else,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except a much-needed drink of water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found a pinqui and asked him if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard any recent news from Kuana, rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive to the disappearance of the princess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "News from Kuana?

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned out to be the Chief of Pinquis of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ktuth, bound for a conference with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mango of Kuana. I welcomed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to get inside the Kuana jail, face</seg><seg type="columnLine">to face with my old friend Poblath, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this opportunity would enable me to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">him my long-deferred explanation of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">relations--or rather lack of relations--</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his Bthuh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was three days since I had shaved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I must have presented an uncanny</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight. In fact, the Chief had intimated</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much, as I got aboard his kerkool. So,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Poblath saw me, his jaw dropped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he seemed convulsed with fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go away, dead man," he begged. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">confess it all. I did hire the ant-man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">assassinate you. But, now that you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">my confession, return in peace to the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the boiling seas, and leave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that was why I had been kidnaped!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, at least it let Yuri out of being an</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolute fool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poblath, old friend," I replied, "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">100</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not dead. The ant-man lost me in the fog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I have returned, not to curse you, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather to thank you, for you have saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">me from an unwished marriage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then I got across the explanation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had so long denied me. When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finished, there was no longer any doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Poblath's mind that I was still his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend; and he warmly patted my jaw, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conventional Porovian token of friendship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I fancied that his sweetheart, Bthuh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be so easy to appease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the jail I went to my rooms for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shave and a clean toga, and then re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paired to the garage where I had rented</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kerkool, my intention being to try and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrange to pay for the loss on the install-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to my surprise, the kerkooloolo in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed me that my kerkool had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">found, with its gyros still running, stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing beside the wrecked ant-car, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been brought back to Kuana intact, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all I owed was an extra day's rent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for which he would gladly trust me until</seg><seg type="columnLine">next ticket-day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On returning again to my rooms, I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a messenger with a peremptory summons</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attend the king forthwith, in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that it was now nearly time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening meal. Evidently, old Kew had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of my return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had! When I entered the audience</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber, I entered the presence of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful wrath. Kew was seated on his royal</seg><seg type="columnLine">couch, and standing beside him was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shee-woofus named Bthuh. Never before</seg><seg type="columnLine">had I so stirred a woman's rage, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope never to do so again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The king demanded an explanation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I gave readily enough, but which</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not convince him in the least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cabot Barsarkar," he spoke, "I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not believe you. Concern for the safety of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the princess is very commendable. But, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were that which actuated you, you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have inquired first from me, and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have learned that she had left a note with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, giving word of her departure for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ktuth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, you took the absence of the prin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cess as a mere convenient excuse to desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">your bride at the joining-stand, unmind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful of-the high honor which I was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferring on you in giving the hand of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarkari to you, lately a commoner, nay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a beast from another world. Whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not she will still have you, is for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady to say; but, as for me, you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly incurred the royal displeasure, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am almost minded to revoke your rank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You came to us from among those ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed Formians, under whose thraldom</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am chafing.

But why</seg><seg type="columnLine">not tell the story just as it happened?)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I respectfully withdrew from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">^udience chamber, an attendant softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiated into my antennae that the prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">- 101</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cess desired to see me at once in her apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments.

As I kissed her good</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, with her warm throbbing girlish</seg><seg type="columnLine">body held fast in my arms, a singe star</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone down upon us for an instant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a rift in the circumambient clouds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was it my own planet, the earth? I won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the succeeding days I saw much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Lilia and nothing of Bthuh. And ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">I racked my brains for an idea which</seg><seg type="columnLine">102</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">should point the way out of my difficulties.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My only hope was to perform such a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguished service for my adopted coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try that the king would relent, would for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">give me, and would promote me to the rank</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sarkar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The most distinguished service which a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cupian can render is to invent a new and</seg><seg type="columnLine">popular game, so I set about to do some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in that line. And at last the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, a whiz of an idea! As Hah Babbuh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the Department of Mechanics, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">advised me to seek this means of distinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, so it was to him that I first confided</seg><seg type="columnLine">my plans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At my request, Prince Toron, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">aided me so efficiently in devising my radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">set in the laboratories of Mooni, was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tailed to assist me in this new endeavor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He and a young draftsman and a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemist set to work with me to build the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And what was this new game? Target</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting with army rifles. Explosives were</seg><seg type="columnLine">already known on Poros, being used for</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasting and for airplane bombs. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid of the young chemist, I adapted these</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosives to be sufficiently slow burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drive a rifle without injuring the gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a surprisingly short time we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned out a crude rifle which would actu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally shoot. The heads of the Mathematics</seg><seg type="columnLine">and. Astronomy Departments, Ja Babbuh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Buh Tedn, were then let in on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret, for the purpose of computing tra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectories and designing the sights and wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaf, which they did by an adaption of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">principles employed in computing the orbits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of celestial bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hundred and forty-seven rifles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">then turned out and presented to my ath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">letic club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My club tried out the rifles; and, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last they began to get bull's-eyes, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">went wild over the new sport. The king</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard, and relented sufficiently to send for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and compliment me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After being thoroughly tried out in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred, rifle shooting was next intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced into the clubs to which my three</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistants belonged, and became popular</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there, as well. The idea spread, and soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the clubs throughout the kingdom were</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamoring for guns. The mechanical labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory at Kuana was made over into a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">arsenal, and the chemical laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a huge munition factory, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">athletic clubs of Kuana and the vicinity</seg><seg type="columnLine">detailed some of their members to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtime in my two plants. Cupians will</seg><seg type="columnLine">always work overtime in the cause of play.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Target practice soon became the national</seg><seg type="columnLine">sport of Cupia. The craze even reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">such dimensions that Queen Formis finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispatched a special mission to Kuana to</seg><seg type="columnLine">study the movement and report whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could not be put to some practical use.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The report of that mission is now one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my most treasured possessions, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">framed reproduction of their conclusions</seg><seg type="columnLine">now hangs upon my office wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ant mission concluded, and so re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported to their queen, that the new game</seg><seg type="columnLine">had absolutely no practical application,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that if it kept the crazy Cupians quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took their minds off their troubles, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might prove a valuable contribution to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward simplifying the enforcement of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treaty of Mooni. And so, indeed, it seemed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toron neglected politics to become a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficient shot, and his anti-Formian move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment rapidly subsided. All of which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly as I had planned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The collapse of the Toron movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">so pleased the exiled Prince Yuri that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent a special ambassador to his brother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">offering to assist in introducing the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">sport to the Cupians at Mooni. But "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear the Greeks even when bearing dough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nuts," as we used to say at Harvard. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yuri's kind offer was declined. We did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, present a sample rifle and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our powder to the authorities of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Imperial University of the ant-men at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">request, for we could not very well refuse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FINALLY King Kew himself conde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended to sit in at the conferences</seg><seg type="columnLine">between Hah Babbuh, Buh Tedn, Ja</seg><seg type="columnLine">Babbuh, Toron, and myself. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooding a good deal recently on the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignities inflicted on his people by Queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">103</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Formis, with whom he had had several</seg><seg type="columnLine">disputes lately; and the committee-work</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to divert and cheer him up greatly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But still I was not made a sarkar, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">I learned from Lilia that Hah Babbuh had</seg><seg type="columnLine">urged this on the king. The influence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bthuh Sarkari was still to strong. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was rumored that she now aspired to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make herself Queen of Cupia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, I did not mind. Better even one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her sons on the throne than Yuri!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having got the new game well under</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, I next turned to my old love, radio.</seg><seg type="columnLine">First I obtained some stones from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howling Valley, which was easy, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my deafness to Hertzian waves; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">[ was unable to put them to any practical</seg><seg type="columnLine">use. Then I devised a simple wave trap</seg><seg type="columnLine">-for absorbing the ordinary carrying waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Porovian speech.. Also I arranged a</seg><seg type="columnLine">variable condenser, which could so alter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the capacity of the Cupian antennae that</seg><seg type="columnLine">selective sending and reception were pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These two devices were combined in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small box which could easily be carried on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man's head and be coupled to his an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tennae. My third invention on these lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a broadcasting set, whereby the nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal Cupian sending range of four para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stads--about fifty yards--was increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to half a stad--about half a mile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, in my frantic quest for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarkarship, I introduced a still further</seg><seg type="columnLine">new game, namely marching evolutions</seg><seg type="columnLine">on an extended scale. Strictly speaking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was really an adaptation of an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">game, rather than the creation of a new,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for marching formations had always been</seg><seg type="columnLine">popular in Cupia; but my three new radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">devices made it possible to perform these</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolutions by twelves of thousands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We tried it out in our own twelve thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. The commander broadcast his</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders to the selectively tuned headsets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eklats, and they in turn to the pootahs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of whom then directed his hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">at ordinary wave length.

Seizing the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cupian by the shoulder, he swung him</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, at the same time discharging his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own revolver. An ant-man exploded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Cupian, fascinated, fired his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle with equal success. Then, at Toron's</seg><seg type="columnLine">peremptory command, a few more of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">men halted long enough to try their rifles</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At each shot, one Formian exploded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The effect was splendid. Our men stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed ranks again, opened fire, and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced once more toward Formia. The tra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition of Formian invincibility was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Messengers now came with word that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of kerkools were bringing up ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">reenforcements over all the roads leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the border. But what could jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">avail them against dum-dum bullets?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I learned later that the ants had at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked certain outlying towns of our coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try earlier in the day, expecting to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy work of them, and to wreak a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vengeance on the unprotected inhabitants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But our casualties there had been sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisingly light. In the village of Beem,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Okarze Mountains, rocks were used</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the attackers, and the chance remark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fine target practice!" had suggested to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some bright local mind the use of rifles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which the ant-men had been repulsed'</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ease. At Bartlap, one of the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had indiscreetly mentioned that rifles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cause of the war, and immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles were effectively produced. In most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other instances the Formians had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been recalled to reenforce the attack on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kuana.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now a new development occurred, for a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet of airships appeared on the horizon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently high explosive bombs began</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping with frightful havoc among my</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounded troops, who once more broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran. In a few paraparths the planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be over the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I dispatched Poblath on the run to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">university, and soon my human sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing was rewarded by a sharp crack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack-crack from the Mechanics Building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first plane toppled and fell. The sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond. And then the third. The others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensing a power beyond their ability to</seg><seg type="columnLine">combat, wheeled and withdrew. Our armies</seg><seg type="columnLine">reformed and once more advanced toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Formia. The first of my huge secret ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines, an anti-aircraft gun, had spoken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon messengers brought word that in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense fighting was in progress for the pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">session of the Third Gate. Of course it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be many days before our forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">could reach the western two gates, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk of the populations of both countries</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived near the Third Gate, due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountainous nature of the country to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came news that the Formians at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Third Gate had been flanked by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our men who had surmounted the pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">with scaling ladders. The Third Gate fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hands of Cupia. Our victorious</seg><seg type="columnLine">armies were on enemy soil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was war to the hilt! And it satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sporting sense of all Cupia, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Formians had invaded and attacked first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A special detachment of Mooni-trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">aviators and mechanics had gone at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the three planes as soon as we had shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">them down, and now one of them arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air fully repaired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moment had arrived for the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">master stroke in the new Cupian national</seg><seg type="columnLine">game--war. For the second huge machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the courtyard of the Department of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mechanics was a sixteen inch barbette</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast artillery rifle, which had been trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the Imperial City of the ant queen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by exact elevation and azimuth, carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">computed by Buh Tedn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The huge gun boomed forth.

Finally, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">at nightfall, the signal came to cease fir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The Imperial City, from which Queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Formis had been directing her troops, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been totally destroyed, and with it pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumably the queen and her friend and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, the renegade Yuri.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our armies still pressed forward into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Formia from air attack by the three re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paired planes and by the anti-aircraft gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been sent forward by kerkool.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was jubilant.

But at last we</seg><seg type="columnLine">came within sight of an undamaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">dungeon, where Lilia lay chained, alive</seg><seg type="columnLine">^nd well. v</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet even as we hailed her through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack in the debris, we saw two ant-men</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter the dungeon through another pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage, unchain the princess, and carry her</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quick as a flash I remembered my re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver, and opened fire through the crack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasting one of her abductors. But as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew a bead on the other, my weapon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked from my hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning angrily, I beheld our guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing over me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I fulfilled my bargain," he said, "when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I showed you the princess. Now I owe you</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more. Those Formians are my fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">countrymen, and I have saved one of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least, from the horrible death."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And lost me my princess," I shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were now surrounded by my squad</seg><seg type="columnLine">with drawn rifles, but they did not dare</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, for fear of hitting n^e. I was at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercy of our guide. He had too much re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spect for the dum-dum bullets, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was easily hauled off of me and placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">under arrest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My men then proceeded to hack their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way into the dungeon, and we at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed the trail of the princess. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not easy, for the city was a total</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck. A hundred ways presented them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, through which her captor might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have crawled. So we withdrew and threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cordon around the entire city, dispatch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a few searching parties again into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior. This was made possible by ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditional reenforcements from headquarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As luck would have it, the ant-man</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally made his appearance, with Lilia</seg><seg type="columnLine">held tightly in his jaws, at the very point</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the line of sentries where I happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be. Instantly a dozen rifles covered him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he radiated the peremptory com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand: "Stop! Put down your rifles."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Put them down," I ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," he continued, "if a rifle is raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, I bite, and the princess dies. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives only on condition that I am given</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe passage, with her as my prisoner. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">within our lines she will be treated well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for she will prove a valuable hostage to</seg><seg type="columnLine">support the demands of Formis for a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Formis is dead," I objected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One Formis is dead," he replied. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are always maggots which we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatten to make a new queen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this point Lilia interjected faintly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bite, oh, Formian, for I would die, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than betray my country."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I said: "You may proceed. Not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle will be raised against you, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">princess must be saved."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing however had been said about</seg><seg type="columnLine">108</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">revolvers, and evidently the ant-man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unacquainted with that weapon. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through our lines, keeping a care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful watch on the rifles of our sentries, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired my revolver from the hip; and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment later Lilia was clasped safely in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tenderly we greeted each other. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">parched and hungry, and our first task</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to give her food and drink, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were easily found among the ruins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came explanations. She had awak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened to find herself in the dungeon about</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon of the day before. Yuri had informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her that the Cupian attack had been met</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stopped, and that airplanes were about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to destroy Kuana. Then he had been hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly called away, and she had seen no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one since. She could hardly believe us</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we told her that the attack had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a success, that Queen Formis was dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the power of Formia was broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN she had rested, I at once sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">her home under guard in a kerkool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself proceeded to headquarters to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn how the war was progressing. Much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I longed to accompany her, my first</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty was to my adopted country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Number 356-1-400, before leaving,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gratefully offered an honorable freedom</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Cupia, but he scornfully replied that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rather die fighting for his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. I respected his attitude, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him a safe-conduct through our lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rejoin his own troops. Later in the war</seg><seg type="columnLine">his number was reported to me as being</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the casualties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At headquarters I found Hah Babbuh</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fine spirits. The power of Formia was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken indeed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wautoosa had fallen into our hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, with it, a number of planes, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus were added to our steadily growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-force. Kerkools were patrolling all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads, shooting ant-men at sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hah was particularly jubilant over what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened at Mooni. Early on Peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">Day, the Cupian students had somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">received word of what was afoot. Joining</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with the slaves, they had slightly out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbered the ant-men there present and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had captured the University after a fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle, thus preventing the ant-men from</seg><seg type="columnLine">removing or destroying the priceless gems</seg><seg type="columnLine">of knowledge stored there. When our van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard arrived, our students were already</seg><seg type="columnLine">in control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the days that followed, our advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">progressed. City after city fell into our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, in sufficient numbers and contain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sufficient supplies, so that we did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to give any thought to the quartering</seg><seg type="columnLine">or feeding of our men. All that was neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary was a steady stream of ammunition</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeding from Kuana to our outposts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had given strict orders that Doggo</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Yuri were to be taken alive, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">former because I wished to spare him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a friend, the latter because I looked for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward with extreme pleasure to seeing him</seg><seg type="columnLine">executed for treason. But neither was cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured. The numbers of all dead ant-men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were taken and turned in, but Doggo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">number was not among them. And to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">day I do not know what became of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">or of Yuri.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was my ambition to exterminate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire race of ant-men from the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poros, with the single exception of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend Doggo. But this wish was not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be gratified. For, as the Formians re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated southward, our line of communica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion became more and more extended, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our troops more and more undisciplined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually the Formians obtained rifles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly from the two cities which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had bombed. Then they made a stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sent out snipers, and this netted them</seg><seg type="columnLine">more rifles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our people began to grumble. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">widows and orphans of the slain did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciate the honor which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust upon them. The sport-loving</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cupians in the field chafed under mili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary restraint, and demanded to be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned home to their games. And a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable number of the populace were</seg><seg type="columnLine">even heard to say that two years slavery</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Formia was far better than a life-long</seg><seg type="columnLine">slavery in the army of a military dictator</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">- 109</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--meaning the four or five weeks since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">war had started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, reluctantly, King Kew concluded</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new peace with what was left of Formia.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A new pale was set up far to the south</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old. Formia had to bear the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost of the war. Ant-men were forbidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry arms or to enter Cupia, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">their airships were confiscated. The Kings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Cupia reserved a veto power over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Formian laws forever. But King Kew</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisely decided not to demoralize Cupia</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the introduction of Formian slaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our University set up a , branch at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mooni, in order that the glamour of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">name might not be lost. Our bravest</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers, and our war widows, were re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warded-by grants of land and of city resi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dences in the captured territory, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost completely alleviated the popular</seg><seg type="columnLine">discontent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not until the treaty was concluded did</seg><seg type="columnLine">I return from the field. The papers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed in the same hall at Mooni which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had witnessed the degradation of Cupia</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred years ago; for "defeat is</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterest at the scene of a former victory,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Poblath remarked. And on the occasion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the present treaty, Kew, surrounded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his generals and in the presence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signatories, was crowned King of all Poros.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This idea, by the way, was due to Pob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lath, the philosopher, and it won him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">barsarkarship, which came in very handy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was much decorating with medals</seg><seg type="columnLine">and handing out of promotions. Needless</seg><seg type="columnLine">to state, the king made me a sarkar; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Assembly, not to be outdone, voted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make me a winko, or field marshal, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">life!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW marriage was possible between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lilia and me. And also between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bthuh and Poblath, for Bthuh had proven</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a good sport and had finally ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted him; and, as Lilia had prophesied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bthuh settled down and became a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet and domestic wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The proudest and happiest moment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my entire life was when, upon the jdining-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand of Kuana in the presence of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">assembled multitude, King Kew pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced the words which made Lilia my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We spent our honeymoon camping out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a most beautiful rocky island in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of Lake Luno, which lies nestled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hills and surrounded by deep woods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a thousand stads to the northward of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kuana. I had discovered the place by ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cident, while on an airplane trip to an iso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated mountain community immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the war, for the purpose of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferring decorations on the first company</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had stood its ground against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">onslaught of the ant-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The walls of the island rise sheer some</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine parastads from the water's edge, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in one spot the sloping sward runs</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a cleft in the rocks down to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandy beach. The interior of the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">slopes gently from the cliffs down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sides to a little pond in the center,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and is about equally divided between lawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stately grove. Here Lilia and I plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">to build.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here we spent many golden days, swim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming and fishing and climbing, but mostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">just looking into each other's eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At our first dip in the water, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">horribly embarrassed. In the first place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had to shed my headset, which always</seg><seg type="columnLine">puts me at a disadvantage. And, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second place, my wings came unstuck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell off, and my matted hair exposed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears, so that I stood before her an earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, with all my horrible earthly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formities. Yet, still she loved me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our honeymoon was idyllic and ideal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But all good things must end, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally had to return to the city to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">up my duties, for added to my honors</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a place in the Royal Cabinet as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minister of Play, the former incumbent</seg><seg type="columnLine">having died during my absence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have various projects in hand for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">adopted country.

It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">great! The type of story I--and a host of</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, I'll wager--have been waiting to read</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.

Close upon Farley's heels</seg><seg type="columnLine">come Marshall's "Who is Charles Avison ?" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flint's "The Lord of Death." Of course "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conquest of the Moon Pool" is in a class all by</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, and it becomes more engrossing every</seg><seg type="columnLine">installment.

I hold out for an unfixed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose method of selection. Who cares if the tale</seg><seg type="columnLine">was written in 1900 or 1939 ? After all, it's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story that counts, the fact that it is a classic, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">its age. So make a nice balance of it.
