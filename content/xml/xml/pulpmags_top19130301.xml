            <seg type="columnLine">by nature; then you throw him one of the pieces of fish, and he naturally and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">easily catches it. Next you tie a piece of fish on the end of your string and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">swing it toward the seal; he catches this, too, and you keep moving away from</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">detecting the fish in the tip of the cone, seeks it out. The cone catches on his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">snout and he bites out the fish and tosses the cone aside. Before long he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">comes to associate the cone with fish, and he will catch any number of similar</seg>
