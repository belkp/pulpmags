            <seg type="columnLine">and reach it, but failed to get entirely out of the water.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was now very angry. H|is tail was lashing the water</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and his forefeet were madly clawing the air. He uttered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">no sound, but his jaws were snapping in anticipation of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the dinner he expected.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> After observing his anger in the water for several</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">minutes, the Selenites decided to try and entice him out</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on dry land. Keeping just out of his reach, they moved</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">toward the shore. The Tyrannosaurus followed them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out on dry land. He now looked to be about forty feet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from snout to tail and his powerful hind legs were taxed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to the limit to carry the weight of his enormous body.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He showed his rage by clawing the ground and snapping</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at the air. Several times he tried to leap up into the air</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to reach the mysterious enemies who so easily eluded</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him. But he was no better at jumping than an elephant.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The enormous muscles of his two hind legs were unable</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to propel his body more than two feet into the air.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> His anger now amused the Selenites, who did several</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">things to tease him. A big bundle on the end of a long</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rope, suspended from one of the spheres, was offered to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him. He became more active than ever as he tried to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">grasp this tempting mouthful, but it was always just out</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of his reach. After several hours, the monster was very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tired and only by letting the bait come within a few feet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of him, could he be tempted to strike at it. The sun</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was nearing the horizon and the Selenites decided to de-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">story the creature before he could return to the water.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The bundle of waste material was dropped to him.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">While he was amusing himself by tearing it to pieces</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with his mighty teeth and small forelegs, another bundle</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was being prepared. This second bundle contained noth-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing but explosives. As it was dropped from the sphere,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at the end of a rope, he opened his jaws like a crocodile</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and again rose on his hind legs. The package was drop-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ped into his enormous open mouth, which closed upon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The explosion blew his terrible head to atoms, but his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">body became more active than ever. He claw6d the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">tried to leap into the air. His tail was striking terrific</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blows, knocking trees over as his headless body continued</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to writhe in agony. Here was another mystery to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Selenites. They could not understand a creature so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">frightful as this, who refused to die after his head was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blown to atoms. They had the idea that his head was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not the center of his intelligence. Probably his brains</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were located in some other part of the huge body.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> But they determined to destroy the monster, so a heat</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ray was turned on him. This heat ray consumed his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">entire body, but the last part to be destroyed continued</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to move until it was utterly charred. They had failed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to find where his brain was located and it was believed by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">many that the creature never had any. But they knew</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that he was the master of his environment. A creature</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Barlenkoz and the Vuduites should be destroyed as a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">an atomic explosion, such as had destroyed old Tiverpo</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was not considered very seriously. Even if the moon</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in their efforts to escape, and the Selenites prevented</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">many of them from doing this. During previous raids,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the white and mixed population had been spared, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Krago saw a menace in any form of Barlenkozian civili-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> It has been shown that the black civilization was on</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> By the time the last city south of the Sahara Sea was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">destroyed, storms of unheard-of fury were raging over</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">of the storm, Krago ordered the fighting to stop until the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">alarmed at the storms, which were entirely unknown on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her own world, broadcast a call for help. When her sig-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> He was overjoyed to learn that his wife had suffered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">no ill effects from the storms. Then Fisoka suggested</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a celebration in honor of the victories of her husband</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over the Vuduites. Among the Selenites a celebration</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could be started without much excuse, so it was not long</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">until the fleet of invisible raiders had become a fleet of</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the weather had cleared and the Selenites</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">dropping behind the distant waters of the Atlantic. It</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the darkness of night. The blue terrestrial sky was a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> But it was the sunrise that most impressed Krago and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his bride. It was while observing a sunrise of unusual</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beauty that a strange discovery was made. Between</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the rising sun and the tiny mountain range over which</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">As Fisoka turned toward the west to observe the shadows</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">it looked as if the level of the sea was much higher than</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the deep valley to the east. As Krago looked, his eyes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">confirmed her opinion, but he knew that it was a scien-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tific impossibility for dry land so close to the vast sea</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to be below the level of the sea. What was to prevent</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the waters of the sea from filling the valley? It was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">undoubtedly an optical illusion, a trick of the strange</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Barlenkozian atmosphere, and their eyes were being de-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ceived. But Fisoka's feminine intuition told her that</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">corridor, like the noise of wind in trees. It grew in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">intensity to a high pitched whine; and suddenly, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">American felt himself lifted off his feet. An invisible</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">force was propelling him up through the winding</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">passageway. In front of him soared the lama, and on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">either side floated a guard. Around and around they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spiralled almost interminably. At about two hundred</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">feet up, the whine ceased abruptly, and they were de-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">posited once more on the solid floor. "This must be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the top of the tower," thought Dunton.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Above them a door opened noiselessly and a white</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brilliance flooding the hall caused him to blink for a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">moment. Then the group rose, again lifted by the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The vault of the dome, he saw was fifty feet in height.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">bearded; cloven hoofs protruded from a richly em-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blazoned robe, and a huge forked tail wound its way</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over the face of the dome. He was seated on a golden</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">throne; in one hand he grasped firmly a writhing three-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">headed serpent, each head bearing a golden crown; from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the other hand, with outstretched palm downward,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Below his cloven feet were depicted a multitude of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">aura of evil about them. The indescribable horror of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The place was a hive of activity. Men, garmented in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">voiced orders were given in a tongue unknown to the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Then the solution came to him. These were Persians,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The deep tones of a gong interrupted him. As the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">lifted from the floor, floating swiftly down the twisting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">corridor back to the oriental chamber. There the ex-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">And that maiden--was she real too, or some hypnotic</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">vision? He lay back on his cushions to try to straighten</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Minutes later, a sound roused him, a panel slid open,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and there appeared again the girl of his thoughts. There</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was no doubt about it--she was real, living flesh and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blood, bearing food on the crystal tray. Dunton forgot</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the lama and his strange story--his eyes feasted on her</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">beautiful form. She was even more lovely than at her</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> She felt his gaze upon her, and a rosy flush came to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her cheeks. Timidly she looked at him. Was there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pity in that glance, was that a tear starting from the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blue of her eye? He started forward. Hastily she set</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down the tray and like a startled fawn, fled from the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">room. The tapestry swung back into position, and thq</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">too ardent explorer was brought up against the blank</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">ABSENTLY he ate the strange foods on the tray.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The warm emotions he was experiencing left no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">room for any other sensations. Who was this white'</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">maiden, so English in appearance; what was she doing in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">this hellish place? How explain the mystery of her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">presence? And again there occurred to him the vague</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">familiarity of her adorable countenance--somewhere he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had seen features resembling hers--a crude likeness, as</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> But the explorer was soon aroused from his romantic</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thoughts. Again the two guards stood before him. In</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his absorption he had not seen or heard their entry.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Obediently, he followed them through an aperture that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had not been disclosed before. For some time they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stumbled through a long, low, dark tunnel, dripping with</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> A breath of warm, perfumed air caressed Dunton's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cheek, and the next moment he was out in the open.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Involuntarily, a cry of delight broke from him. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Garden of Paradise! A veritable Eden! Never in all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his adventurous career had he seen anything to compare</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with the luxuriousness, the indescribable glories of this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spot. No wonder the original Fedai--band of sworn</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">assassins--met death gladly, if this was their foretaste</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the Paradise to come!</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Before him stretched a vast garden, bathed in a golden</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">glow, its source unseen. It was night, and the velvet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">black sky was studded with brilliants. Patterned clus-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ters of rare and exotic blooms grew in profusion, yield-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing soft perfumes. And closely intermingled, was the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">familiarly drowsy incense of hasheesh. Strange, soft</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">music tinkled and strummed from invisible musicians--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Oriental and sensuous--conjuring visions of harem</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Finely carved tables were scattered around, bearing</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">granates, golden oranges, and bursting tender figs,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flanked by crystal goblets filled with amber liquor. Long</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">low divans were near each table, gorgeously damasked,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> On the divans lolled a multitude of men, clad in im-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">maculate white robes. Dunton walked down a flower</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lined path toward the reclining figures, closely followed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by the maroon guards. As he approached the ban-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">queters, they turned lustreless, disinterested eyes on him;</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The first glimpse, however, was sufficient to bring</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Of all the surprising sights he had witnessed in this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crowded day and night, this was the strangest. These</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Englishman; next him sat a bearded Frenchman; on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the other side sprawled an olive skinned Italian. All</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about was a polyglot assemblage--all the races of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> What lent an air of utter unreality to the scene, was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the dullness of their eyes, the pallor of their faces, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">set looks of automatons. Though they were feasting,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there was no sound of revelry or merriment; they ate</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in silence with stiff mechanical movements; no one spoke</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to his neighbor, or seemed aware of his presence. There</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was something sinister about these men. Dunton</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shivered as though a cold blast had struck his heart. A</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pall of evil--some mighty enchantment--seemed laid on</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> He had no time to investigate further. His warders</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prodded him, motioning for him to proceed. Down</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">scented paths they moved. A figure darted across an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">intersecting path. His heart gave a quick leap as he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">recognized the girl of his dreams. She favored him</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Nobody was near, and there was no sign of a vehicle.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then a long drawn-out shrill whistle sounded right be-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">floor opened out on both sides, and out of the earth</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rose a little car, that seemed a cross between an elevator</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and an electric car. At once a door opened automatically</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and at the same time, though nobody was to be seen,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a loud voice called out in English, "Get in, quickly,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> I obeyed the call and got into the car, looking vainly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for any other occupant. After exactly half a minute</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the door shut, the car lit up, and then seemed first to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sink down and afterwards to roll sideways. I had my</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Schmidt looked at me. There was a slight smile</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The familiarity which he used as a matter of course</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Schmidt pressed a button, and the chair rolled out</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">automatically and stopped beside the desk. I sat down.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was a comfortable chair, and as I sat there, the back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">automatically moved forward a bit, so that it lay right</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and gave me time to look at him. I must admit that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">although I was somewhat ill at ease, I yet felt attracted</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">where, but of course that was not possible. Indeed,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">it could be heard above the noise of the engines, startling</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">me greatly. His years in the bush and his life with</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">they no longer feared any uprising of the people, nor any</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">embezzlement by employees. The telecops which guarded</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their treasure and maintained their power were strictly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mechanical and operated by a secret code that was known</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">no wise kept pace with the progress of mechanical inven-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tion. All advancement had been material. Politicians</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">openly abused their government. Humility, charity,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">idealism, self-sacrifice, these were traits unknown. Love</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had a new definition, and the new life, beneath its</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">wheeled in perfect unison, and came tramping in, bowing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their heads to clear the doors. The whole inside of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">his body rigid as though frozen, he remembered that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Vandyke had drunk of his pale green drops, and he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">remembered too that he must know the code which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">worked the telecops. That all he lacked was a few drops</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of alkali to give him speech and movement. If he could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">only get down to the basement where he had his vials of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">alkali he could revive this man and bring about order</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out of chaos. The invulnerable police which once had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> He picked up Vandyke in his arms and ran out into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the hall. Even as he ran hurriedly for the lower floors</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he noticed that the telecops were as good as ever despite</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the terrific heat which had been thrown upon them. They</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were evidently made to stand intense heat as well as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">any other mode of attack. But the vials of alkali were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not for Zulerich just then. They were far below and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he could hear men already crowding back into the palace</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">pulled himself from under the helpless man in his arms,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who had fallen across his thighs. He got to his feet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with one leg wobbly and hurt, and started to hobble</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">come and put him in a grave. His big heart would not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">let him leave the helpless man to be consumed. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reached down and dragged the stiff length of him to</seg>
