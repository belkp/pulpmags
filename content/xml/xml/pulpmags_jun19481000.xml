But though a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand die, this small one will never</seg><seg type="columnLine">know her father's hut again."

The natives only entered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark land in armed force, for the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derous strength and almost man-like cun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning of the great beasts made them fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful adversaries for hunters armed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">only spears and bows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three hours after leaving Helene, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor caught his first glimpse of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">apes he scented.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept parallel 'with the path, turning and</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling with it, but not once in the several</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes the White Lord watched them</seg><seg type="columnLine">did they ever actually set foot on it. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead, they chose the much more difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">going of the underbrush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another strange thing was their sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained fast pace. The Ingagi is usually an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhurried traveller, stopping often to</seg><seg type="columnLine">browse for choice green shoots or over-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turn a fallen rotted limb in search of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grubs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor, though intrigued, had no time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to waste on idle curiosity. Without ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing abreast of the apes, he turned off</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right, circled around them and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the path. They might not take</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindly to the sight of a hairless white ape</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging over them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to Ki-Gor's surprise, he no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than got around the first group, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself over six more of the beasts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They behaved in the same manner, keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing well away from the path, yet follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing its windings exactly. And they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">all bull apes, not a single female.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried again to avoid discovery, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden downcurrent of air carried his</seg><seg type="columnLine">man-scent to the brutes. The creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly halted, uttering low, rumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">growls while their bloodshot, beady eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched for the human who dared come</seg><seg type="columnLine">near them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE APE that sighted Ki-Gor first</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a roar of rage, thrust up on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind legs and hammered his chest thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derously with giant, knotted fists. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast allowed himself only this single,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surging outburst of wrath, then he raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a low-hanging limb, leaped high to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp it. Within seconds he was swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaping upward through the branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the White Lord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor didn't want trouble, but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwilling to engage in a grim game of hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seek with six raging bull apes. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to lose them, he would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerve far off his course, uselessly wast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing both time and energy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So instead of running, he swung his bow</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his back, snatched a long barbed ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row from his quiver and fitted it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowstring. He was drawing a bead ' on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rapidly climbing ape, when the largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the beasts on the ground broke into</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious barks and snarls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The outburst apparently was directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the bull going after Ki-Gor, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaggy giant immediately stopped climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He glared fiercely at the White Lord,</seg><seg type="columnLine">baring his fangs. Then slowly, reluctant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, the ugly beast started down toward his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor lowered his bow, a faint frown</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming over his taut features.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN CLAWS OF RAA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He studied with new interest the ape-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader who had called back the bull.

He pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded more warily than before, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he avoided further trouble, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed six more groups before the harsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorilla scent disappeared, telling him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ahead of the strange migration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later, he caught up with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave caravan and all thought of the apes</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thrust from his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though he kept well away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel procession, he could still hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady crack of whips, the sudden agonized</seg><seg type="columnLine">screams of tortured men and'women. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few times through breaks in the wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">foliage he kept between himself and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slavers he caught glimpses of the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffling lines of shackled prisoners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the slow pace of the caravan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the large number of captives who fell and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be whipped to their feet, Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that even the most brutal taskmasters</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be able to keep the slaves mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing much longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blacks were exhausted, having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven mercilessly the past two days while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slavers sought to get away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene of the attack.

If he was as harsh a master as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that, the Bantus would desert like jackals</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any time the tide of battle went against</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The slaver didn't rouse until the strag-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gling lines of chained men and women</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">began dragging into the clearing. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shoved away from the tree, stood poised</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like some evil bird of prey. As though</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">impelled to cruelty by the very sight of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their master, the guards strung out along</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the weary files began to wield their whips,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cursing and threatening the prisoners. Ki-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gor noted there were two more Arabs in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the caravan, both armed with rifles. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">furtive manner in which they kept glanc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing at the burnoose-clad figure by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stream indicated they feared their leader</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as much as the Bantus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The captives were chained in groups of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty. Studying them, Ki-Gor knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slavers had moved swiftly over a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">area, making quick strikes against every</seg><seg type="columnLine">unguarded kraal they encountered, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than risking an all-out attack against any</seg><seg type="columnLine">single people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In addition to about eighty pygmy pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oners, they had snared some fifty Obanti,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety Wasuli, and sixty Watussi. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that nearly two-thirds of the captives</seg><seg type="columnLine">were young women told Ki-Gor another</seg><seg type="columnLine">msavory truth about the slavers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Angered and sickened by the spectacle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor was watching the final group</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven into the clearing with senseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">whippings, when a totally unexpected sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten paces behind the last of the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">captives came a single woman closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded by four Bantus.

So well</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportioned was her lithe, curved body</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it took a second glance for one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize how much larger and stronger she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was than most women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STRANGELY, she was clad in a crude-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly fashioned halter and a wrap-around</seg><seg type="columnLine">breechclout of monkey-skin. The firm set</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her red mouth, the quick way her grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes lashed her guards told of a seething</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger. And there was no doubt that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slavers had failed to break her will. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked firmly, even arrogantly, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight-held shoulders betrayed no weari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her hands were tied behind her, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">addition to the steel circlet around her</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, another band of steel had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked about her naked waist. Two guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">held rawhide thongs attached to the neck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">band, while the other two Bantus held</seg><seg type="columnLine">thongs tied to the waistband.

Then he slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly down the tree, wormed away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp through the underbrush and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his way back to the trail.

Then he lifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear from the water, where, like the Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sai, he had trailed it a few inches beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface so no gleam of its shovel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bladed point wouldn't betray them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The water was only to his chest now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stepped around the log and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the camp.

He apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been sleeping fully dressed, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore his white robes and had even taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to hood his face.

With slow, deliberate actions, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">divested herself of her own weapons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped them on the ground. She took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the key from her husband.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then talking softly, reassuringly, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached the girl.

From the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blonde handled her hands, Helene</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew they were without feeling from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight bonds, so she massaged them gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BLONDE gingerly submitted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ministrations, but for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene's talking, the girl never uttered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word. Most of the time she kept her</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance fixed on Ki-Gor, studying minutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man she sensed was in control of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">war party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When circulation had been restored to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands, she abruptly pulled them away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Helene. She flexed her fingers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved her arms, trying them. She seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to change, confidence coming into her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She pushed past Helene, and no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing any apprehensiveness, walked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Ki-Gor. Her movements had a cat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth, flowing grace. And there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat-like intensity to the unblinking gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which .she scrutinized the White Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">at close range. She appeared unaware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tembu George's existence, so utterly did</seg><seg type="columnLine">she ignore him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite the air of strangeness about her,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">word nor expression did she give any evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor could not help but be struck with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her unusual beauty.' She would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought a fortune to Slaker. Among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusky-skinned races, a blonde woman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly esteemed, and one as fair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">young as this would have set any slave</seg><seg type="columnLine">mart into an uproar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled at her. "I'm sorry we</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled you," he said. "We'll get you</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to your people as soon as we can.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tell me, what is your name and where</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you from ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She watched his lips, tilting her head a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little to listen as he spoke. But by neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">word nor expression did she give any evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence she understood him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead, she stepped close to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched his hair- with her hand, dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">her fingers to his shoulder and traced them</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly down his arm. Then she ran the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat of her palm across the rock-like pads</seg><seg type="columnLine">of muscle which ridged out across Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's broad chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was neither boldness nor affec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in the gesture. She seemed to act</seg><seg type="columnLine">purely from curiosity, like a child inspect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing some strange object.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's eyes momentarily widened in</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise. She acted as though she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seen a man before, anyway a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. And at her touch there rose un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidden to his mind an almost forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">incident of his youth. He had carelessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen asleep on a grassy plot beside a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, only to be awakened by a velvety</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch exploring his bare skin. He found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lioness curiously snuffling his body. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had kept perfectly still, expecting death at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any moment, but for some inexplicable</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason the cat had padded off into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">20	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle once its curiosity was satisfied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Helene, I don't believe this girl under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands a word we say," he declared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene's answer was drowned out by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blonde's shrill, alarmed cry. Looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the White Lord, the girl had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam Slaker inching on belly toward a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife dropped by some warrior during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle. The slaver had regained con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness and was trying to take advan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tage of Ki-Gor's preoccupation with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl to free himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before Ki-Gor could turn, the blonde</seg><seg type="columnLine">was racing for Slaker. Hearing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream, the slaver writhed about into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting position just in time to see her</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally dive at him. His distorted face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing swollen and bruised from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating Ki-Gor had given him, jerked to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the White Lord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No! No!" he shrieked. "Keep her</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. No!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then the hurtling weight of h«r</seg><seg type="columnLine">body chopped off his voice, and you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear her snarl with the berserk rage of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal. In her attack there was none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aimless clawing and flailing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which most women fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She rained blows on Slaker much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor had, hitting with deadly strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">and accuracy. But where the White Lord's</seg><seg type="columnLine">object had been merely to knock the slaver</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, it was clear she meant to beat the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to death. Bound as he was, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely helpless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He managed once to cry Ki-Gor's name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">appealing for help. But the sound of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice so enraged the girl that she clamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">her fingers about his throat. He bucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly, making a hideous rattling noise as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breath choked off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEITHER Ki-Gor nor Tembu George</seg><seg type="columnLine">had moved, so spellbound were they</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the girl's savagery. But the spectacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocked Helene into speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop her, Ki-Gor!" she shouted. "She's</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor roused then, reached the blonde</seg><seg type="columnLine">in four quick steps. He caught her hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pried them from Slaker's throat, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his full strength to do so. She fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get back at the slaver, and failing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, she switched her attack on the White</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord. It finally required the combined</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts of Tembu George and Ki-Gor both</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drag her away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the same swiftness with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had attacked Slaker, she suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">quieted. With smouldering eyes, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">glared at the men holding her and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd of blacks which had gathered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wah!" exclaimed Tembu George.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is no woman from the settlements.:</seg><seg type="columnLine">By all the gods, she's the spawn of jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">devils."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's a strange one, all right," Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "but I don't blame her for wanting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to settle scores with Slaker."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tembu George shook his head wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do we do with her?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let her go," directed the White Lord.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I want her to understand she must leava</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slaker alone, but I don't want her to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're taking his part or are angry with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Right now, she looks like she thinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're allies of his and that we might pun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He released his grip on the girl, patted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her reassuringly on the shoulder. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed at Slaker, waggled a forbidding</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger and repeated the word "no" several</seg><seg type="columnLine">times. He was certain she understood his</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning, but there was no sign she agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to obey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Patch Slaker up as well as you can,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor told Tembu George. "I wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to question him, but from his looks, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't have his senses about him before</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. Meanwhile, I'll see what I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn about the girl from the Bantus."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ki-Gor found that the prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew practically nothing about how Slaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gotten hold of the girl. Four days</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the raid on the pygmy kraal, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaver had left them in camp and gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead with two warriors to scout the area.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he returned he had the girl with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and was in a high rage because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble he had had in making her walk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp. The two warriors weren't with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and when the Bantus asked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, he merely snarled that they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain capturing the girl and gave no de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day had been a strenuous one for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor, so he decided to get what sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could and leave the solution of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blonde's identity for morning. Before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN CLAWS OF RAA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lay down, however, he stood at a distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watched her. Twice he saw her leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene, stride nervously to the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp and stare off into the darkness. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time, she would return, her face thought-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, sit down beside Helene and resume</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at Slaker. She took no notice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone but the slaver, coolly repulsing all</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly overtures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps she is worried that the Bantus</seg><seg type="columnLine">who escaped will return and try to kill or</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture her, thought Ki-Gor.

Ki-Gor didn't approve</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such severe measures, but knowing how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the natives hated and feared the slaver, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it best riot to interfere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor appropriated for himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene one of the comfortable sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">mats in Slaker's tent, gave another to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blonde. The night passed without incident,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except that several times along toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn Ki-Gor was stirred from sleep by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wierd, roaring challenge of a bull ape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are few more blood-chilling sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">than an angry gorilla's cry, but Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't alarmed, because he knew from ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience the great tree-people seldom</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused trouble unless they were molested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the first grey light, the camp be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to awaken.

Without appearing to watch her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he noted the too-quick rise and fall of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">full, firm breasts beneath the narrow hal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, the constant movement of her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the ramparts of the thorn boma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Could it be she is afraid, he wondered?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps her apparent bold self-reliance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only a pose.

Continuing these</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous tactics, Ki-Gor enticed the ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal away from Helene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blood was flooding from the ape's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and wound when the White Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to risk an aggressive move him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self.

With</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists and fangs they laid about them, tear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing four blacks apart in the space of sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds. Then they swung toward the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terror-stricken line where Sam Slaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">■was insanely lunging and throwing him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self about in an effort to break his chains</seg><seg type="columnLine">and run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the three killers staggered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down under a whistling flight of ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows from Tembu George's men, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masai were afraid to shoot at the leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fear of killing the blonde girl.

The other ape bounded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the senseless slaver on all-fours, snarled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the still body. For a moment, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed the animal would bury his fangs</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Slaker's back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But just then the scarred leader reared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his full height, gave a thundering road</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started running toward the jungle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The animal crouching over Slaker imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately scooped up the slaver in his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and charged after his fellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor, who had left Helene and rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help Tembu George, barely had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to cast his spear when the head bull</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave his roar and trampled for cover. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of Ingagi facing the Masai wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they heard their leader's cry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went racing after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hairy horde tore through the thorn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall as though it were paper, plunged into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadowy forest.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash oi snapped limbs, the crackle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed brush faded as the Ingagi's</seg><seg type="columnLine">trampling rush carried them out of hear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May a hundred devils rend my soul,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">swore Tembu George fervently, "if ever I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a more fearful sight!

Finally, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">rejected them all, deciding she would wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">and find a single orchid for her hair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without leaving the path, she rejected a</seg><seg type="columnLine">score of blooms before selecting a pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">white one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She paused to munch a few berries, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bating whether she should turn back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp. A vanka lizard darted out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Wassa grass not four feet from her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snared a green fly with a single dart of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its forked tongue.

She brushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-heartedly at the drops of water which</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung like jewels to the soft gold of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin, as she looked about for a place to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest and sunbathe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She chose a low-hanging limb. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up her halter and shorts, and hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them in her teeth, climbed easily the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slanting trunk of the tree. She walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out along the broad limb to the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it was dappled with sunlight fil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered through a protective screeen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves in the higher branches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene stretched out on her stomach</seg><seg type="columnLine">on - the warm bark, resting her head on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arms.

While Helene listened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the liquid music of their song, she drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She awakened with a start, every mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cle suddenly tense, her heart racing.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairy body was matted with burrs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's turned killer," Helene thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then abruptly, the bull threw himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the bank, began to noisily gulp</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Lying as he was, there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance for him to see Helene,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN CLAWS OF RAA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd be a fool to stay here longer,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene told herself. "I musn't let this</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity pass."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly, yet with infinite caution, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised on hands and knees. The gorilla</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated in his drinking.

Helene picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up her halter and shorts in her right hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was on her feet then, the pulse throb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing in her throat as she turned her back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the beast, started for the tree trunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She judged it would take her fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps to reach the trunk. Then she must</seg><seg type="columnLine">swing around the bole of the tree, run out</seg><seg type="columnLine">along another low branch about ten steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">before she could leap to the limb of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest tree. Once in that second tree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dense jungle growth would begin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">close around her, hide her from view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that moment, Helene was deaf to</seg><seg type="columnLine">every sound except the ape's sucking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water, for so long as that sound con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued she was safe. In the same man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, she was momentarily blind to every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing except the branch along which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran. It might mean her life to stumble or</seg><seg type="columnLine">to strike against a dry twig.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And being oblivious for that fleeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">interval to what went on around her, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't discover the line of gorillas thread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out of the forest until she had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trunk and was starting to swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">around it. Her eyes couldn't fail, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the dark, rapidly moving line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">3--Jungle--Fall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PATH they followed led direct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly under her tree and the leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal was almost beneath her.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeezed against the trunk, drawing back</seg><seg type="columnLine">so for a brief instant at least, she wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be exposed to the view of the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">group.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lead ape gave a harsh, short bark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The scar-faced gorilla by the pool imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately leaped up and answered with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrage of guttural sounds. Stunned as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was, the swift hope drove up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene that the newcomers would charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surly beast by the pool. If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought, there was yet a small chance she</seg><seg type="columnLine">might get away while the whole pack's</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention was focused on the battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the Ingagi poured past beneath her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great brute by the pool gave a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar.

And as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked, all hope died within her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scarred male was pointing one</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge arm directly at her.

And to Helene's horror, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that instead of attacking him, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the newcomers was whirling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">search for her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's now or never!" thought Helene,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grasping her clothes in her teeth, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">started scrambling up the tree trunk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching for the higher branches before</seg><seg type="columnLine">she made her break for the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even as she moved, the scarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute was roaring again.

Apes stood guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the branches of every tree around her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another loose circle of the creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringed her perch on the ground. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed the moment when she had selected</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically the only tree around the pool</seg><seg type="columnLine">which stood so nearly by itself that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be easily blockaded.8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conquering her first feeling of panic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she realized the apes were making no at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to move in on her. None were</seg><seg type="columnLine">even climbing the tree she was in. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely held the positions they had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the first scramble, warily watching her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a treed animal, she stopped climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, her head constantly moving as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to keep all her tormentors in view.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The barking and growling of the Ingagi</seg><seg type="columnLine">died away and in the silence she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear her own quick, labored breathing. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave her a strange, awful feeling to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">those black, glittering eyes staring at her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">from every side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She backed against the trunk, raised a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to take from her mouth the clothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she had been gripping with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth. She held the halter and shorts for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time, and then suddenly looking at them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed surprised to find them in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. It was as though for the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was conscious she was unclothed. Me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanically, Helene donned the two brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">garments, keeping her attention fixed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silent brutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She bit her lower lip, looked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground far below.

A short way fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther on they startled a vanka lizard stalk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flies which buzzed over some crushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">berries she had dropped.

But Ki-Gor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned the dangerous maneuver well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The leopard had to touch the ground be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore reaching him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The raking claws missed him by inches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then there was the merest fraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time in which the jungle killer had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerk its forelegs to the earth before rear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the death-blow.

"Who do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Haa-lane," she pronounced with dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficulty. "Apes have her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's face went pale. His barrage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of questions fell with such violence that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blonde blinked dumbly, confused by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rain of words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Realizing finally what was happening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got hold of himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RAA explained that Helene had strayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the apes' feeding area and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had surprised and captured her.

She declared there would be no need</seg><seg type="columnLine">for additional men if they started im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately. At dark, the prisoners were</seg><seg type="columnLine">put in a cave and one gorilla left to guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, while the other apes wandered off</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their favorite sleeping spots to nap</seg><seg type="columnLine">until moonrise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said she could lead Ki-Gor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso directly to the cave.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out that when the moon was full,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it would be tonight, the whole tribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be out in force. She added that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could wait until the next night, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor wished, though it was always pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible for the tribe to suddenly shift to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other area.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But neither Ki-Gor nor N'Geeso could</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear the thought of leaving Helene in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts' hands throughout the night, let</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone through the following day. They im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately decided to forget the Masai</seg><seg type="columnLine">and handle the rescue together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!" approved Raa.

"Kill easy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then she turned and set off at a trot</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the path.

The unnatural im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobility, the eerie silence of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">apes couldn't continue long. She was cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain, therefore, that the outburst of noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the apes on the ground signaled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of their rush to kill her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a taut-drawn bow, her lithe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved body poised for the dive that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would smash her life out on the hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth far below. Better to meet death</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way than at the hands of the beasts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her glance stabbed down, picked the path</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would follow, then swept to judge the</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress of the climbing apes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Helene's amazement, not a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">bull was moving up the trunk. The rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the beasts had been past the tree to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the edge of the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And there, surrounded by the leaping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellowing creatures, stood Raa and Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slaker, they were flanked by a guard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">six burly apes who kept their milling fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows at a distance. From their expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions, they were almost as surprised to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene as she was them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then over Slaker's thin, ugly face slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cruel smile. He half-turned to the blonde</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, his lips seeming to move quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in the uproar no sound of his words</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached Helene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene was utterly bewildered. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">long since had accepted the two as dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet here they were, somehow yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive, prisoners of the Ingagi. The iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaver's neckband was still locked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slaker's neck, a length of broken chain</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangling from it. Helene remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to kidnap him a gorilla had broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">that chain with his bare hands, tearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in the process the head of the Bantu</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whom Slaker had been fastened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a roar from their scarred leader,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ingagi again fell silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slaker's taunting voice broke the quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, my dear, so we meet again! How</seg><seg type="columnLine">very, very delightful!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blonde girl gave Slaker an angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare. Then she looked up at Helene,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beckoned with her hand. "Come!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Not hurt." She pointed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apes, repeated, "Not hurt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl was telling her to climb down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Ingagi wouldn't kill her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What will they do with me?" Helene</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked uneasily,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CLAWS OF RAA	41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing," gruffly answered Slaker, "if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you don't give them any trouble.

"If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to live, come on down and join the</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy family. Otherwise, dive on off and</seg><seg type="columnLine">break your fool neck. I'm sure I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">care one way or the other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blonde beckoned again, frowning as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she couldn't understand Helene's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would be foolish, thought Helene,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to give herself up, when she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that both Slaker and Raa were un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmed. The idea of being completely at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beasts' mercy frightened her, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">consoled herself that she wouldn't be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">captive long, Ki-Gor would find and free</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. She might escape within a few hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She started slowly down the tree, low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering herself from branch to branch. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">though struck with abrupt misgivings, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted once, looked searchingly at Raa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blonde smiled and nodded encourage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and, after a moment, Helene con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She waited uncertainly at the base of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tree, apprehensively watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairy giants. They had formed a ragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle about the trunk while she de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended. The scarred leader knuckled for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, glowering. Seeing his fearful face</seg><seg type="columnLine">at such close range, her heart almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">42	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He snuffled her scent, pawed curiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her halter first and then at her red</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. Then his huge fingers clamped over</seg><seg type="columnLine">her shoulder, held her so tightly she</seg><seg type="columnLine">winced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he caught her, he turned his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked gutturally at Raa. To Helene's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock, the blonde girl responded with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift flow of the same harsh, guttural</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds. Raa was talking to the brute in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own sub-human language of snarls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunts. For a full three minutes, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked, oblivious of either Helene or Slak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Slaker registered impatience rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than surprise at Raa's actions. ''What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saying," he finally demanded of Raa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bantus coming," she answered. "Mog</seg><seg type="columnLine">say these white men." She held up one</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger, "And these black men." She held</seg><seg type="columnLine">up eight fingers. "Guns!" she added</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaningfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, don't worry about a few soldiers,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Slaker scoffingly. "Do what I've told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and they'll never have a chance to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">those guns."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She considered his words, her eyes mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thoughtfully over the mass of apes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We go," she agreed. She pointed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene. "Tie!" she ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right," Slaker said. "Give her</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a chance and she'd go skipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the trees. I'll tie her hands with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long vine and you tell one of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkeys to hold onto to it all the time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene looked from one to the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">in consternation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What--what is this?" she asked halt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAKER laughed uglily, walked away</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get a vine without answering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene noticed that a gorilla trailed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind Slaker every step he took. Raa stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her impassively. Gone was the appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent friendliness the blonde had displayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lure Helene down from the tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not until after the slaver had tied her</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists did he speak. "It's quite simple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my dear," he said. "Yesterday your hus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">band turned over his Bantu prisoners to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white officer and eight troops. In a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">while, though he doesn't know it yet, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">white officer will turn the Bantus over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me--uh--or rather to my friends here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We mean to waylay him on the trail. You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">see, we plan to gather quite a few slaves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, of course, my Bantus will come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">very handy in such work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene heard what he said, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole matter was too fantastic for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind to accept. Surely, this must be some</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmare that she would laugh about</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she awakened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slaker savored her expression. "Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I believe you're almost as stupid as your</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband, my dear. Can't you understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that our blonde friend rules these apes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She's one of them. They reared her."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But that can't be true," protested</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene. "You're both their prisoners. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw them capture you." With her chin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she gestured at the chain Slaker wore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You wouldn't be wearing that if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were free."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slaker's eyes grew mean. But he at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to mask his anger with a false,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpleasant smile. He seemed acutely con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious that Raa was watching him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am merely Raa's faithful servant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her teacher and advisor," he declared. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am her friend."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raa grunted disdainfully. "He slave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like you," she said. The least smile curled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner of her lips. "He slave like try</seg><seg type="columnLine">make Raa."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then the whole incredible picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">came clear to Helene. Raa was the ruler</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ape tribe. That explained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ingagi attack on the camp. They came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rescue her, and she had turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables on Slaker, by making him her pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene's face lighted triumphantly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She's making you serve her," she cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Slaker. "So the great Sam Slaker has</seg><seg type="columnLine">become the mousy servant of a bunch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">apes." Helene actually laughed aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slaver shook with anger, knotting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fists as though to strike Helene. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a word from Raa, the ape guarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">him reached out and grasped the chain</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangling from his neck, tugged it just</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly enough to remind him not to cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll laugh a different tune before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm through with you," snarled Slaker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe I did make a mistake in captur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Raa. I didn't know who she was. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">she's learning who her good friend is. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught her to talk.

The brute came forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene saw he was carrying a knobbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">club. Raa took it. "He make Raa club,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said. "That good!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He did those things just so he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">use you," Helene told her.

He could be sure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blonde girl. Helene's words hadn't touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Raa was as much a wild animal as</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of her apes, as dangerous and devoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of feeling--and as simple, if one knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to handle her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mustn't listen to Slaker, pleaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene.

And my dear friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">44	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor, what a pleasant surprise this</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be to him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FEAR touched a cold finger to Helene's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. "Raa!" she cried. "Surely you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't harm the man who saved you</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this mad dango? Ki-Gor helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, yet here you are plotting against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Raa's people save her," snapped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blonde. "Not need or want Ki-Gor's help.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One man all same another. All weak, cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard, bad." She grunted in disgust, spun</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her heel and walked off. "We go!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ingagi hurriedly cleared a path for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, then fell into file behind, except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scarred ape. He shoved up to the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the line, pushed ahead of her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">patted his hurly shoulder affectionately as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took the lead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hours later, a horror-stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene, after being gagged by Slaker, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to watch helplessly while the goril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">las swarmed out of ambush to overwhelm</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lt. Arnsdale and his eight native troops.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It happened with such suddenness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the troops had no chance to defend them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Great hairy forms swinging on vine</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes smashed down from trees on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks. Other apes charged out of thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush on either side of the trail. Five</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somali literally were torn apart in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first rush. The other three were wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knocked senseless after firing a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild shots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lt. Arnsdale, the young officer who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never fired a shot in anger, proved in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those few tumultous moments of battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, as N?Geeso had predicted, he had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">makings of a real fighting man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was the novice, yet his gun was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to speak. He triggered three shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the brute swinging down on him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal roared with pain, turned loose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vine to soon and missed its leap. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">ape sprang on a Somali within a yard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lieutenant, fastened his fangs in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's throat. Arnsdale shoved his pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the back of the ape's skull, fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The white officer spun, his face paper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, but his gun steady. The thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight seemed not to occur to him, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must have believed death was certain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He blasted his last shot into one of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts charging in on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene shuddered and turned away as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she saw him go down. But to her sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise, a minute later the scarred ape, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">surley with battle, brought the white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and threw him on the ground before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raa. Arnsdale was unconscious, but be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the attack Raa had given orders not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to slay him. White hostages, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">learning, were far more valuable than</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Bantus, hysterical with fear, tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stampede when the attack started. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">charging apes bowled them over almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did the Somali, roughly collaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. By the time Slaker appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet the Bantus, two of them were dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and several unconscious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as the battle was over, Slaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">began picking up the soldier's guns. At a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word from Raa, Mog went down, knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">them out of his arms. Then the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute began methodically breaking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting the rifles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slaker appealed to Raa to stop Mog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We need them," he pleaded. "Guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean power. We can handle the blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raa wordlessly waited until the scarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">ape had destroyed the final rifle. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she calmly turned her back on Slaker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the slaver and his men knew how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to handle those deadly firesticks, and naive</seg><seg type="columnLine">though Raa was, she wasn't fool enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to entrust such power to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blonde assessed her losses. Arns-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dale had killed one gorilla, badly wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">another. Two others were hurt, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You won fairly easy this time," Helene</seg><seg type="columnLine">said angrily as her gag was removed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But enjoy yourself while you can, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause from now on the days of you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">your apes are numbered. Next time you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be one of those to die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A faint, derisive smile curled Raa's lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Any unspoken doubts the blonde had about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slaker's evil plans were swept away by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this first swift triumph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Raa go now get Ki-Gor," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You see who die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And leaving Mog to direct the Ingagi</seg><seg type="columnLine">trek back to their home area, the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle girl sped away to backtrack Helene's</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail. Slaker had impressed her with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN CLAWS OF RAA	45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">importance of capturing the White Lord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">RAA set a swift pace, too swift to per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mit such conversation. But though Ki-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gor and N'Gesso were puzzled about the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">girl, they didn't mistrust her. After all,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she had slain a leopard to save Ki-Gor,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and now risking her life to help them free</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Helene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dusk was blotting out the jungle when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Raa halted beside a tiny spring. Ki-Gor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could sense a growing nervousness in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We are nearly there?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She replied, "Soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You're very brave, he said, "to do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Raa not forget you save her from bad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ones," she panted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She dropped to one knee by the spring,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drank slowly and sparingly. When she was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">finished, she stood back as though to give</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the two men room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Drink!" she urged. "CooL Good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The hot, thirsty men needed no urging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor let N'Geeso drink first. Then as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the small black scrambled up, the White</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lord dropped his spear on the ground,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dropped on all-fours and lowered his face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As Ki-Gor took his initial swallow, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heard a thud behind him, followed by a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gasp and the sudden thump of something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heavy hitting the ground. He whirled,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">straining to get to his feet, sensing some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sudden danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Raa's club caught him just back of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. ear as he spun up. He lay crumpled on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Weak, stupid fools!" she gritted. How</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">easy it had been. And these were two the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whole jungle was supposed to fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Raa stepped back, raised her face to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dark sky. A weird, bestial cry burst from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her lips. Twice more in the next ten mi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nutes, she repeated the cry. Then, out of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the night, her brutish followers came to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crowd curiously around the unconscious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">men. Ki-Gor and N'Gesso didn't stir</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when the apes lifted them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When Ki-Gor regained his senses, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was lying on a broad, heavy wooden table</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a dark room. Moonlight streamed in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a narrow column through a barred window</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beside him, sifted through a score of breaks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the roof above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He blinked dully at the two shadowy</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures standing by him. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene and Lt. Arnsdale, but for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment he couldn't understand why they</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be there together, or, for that mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, why he was there himself. He stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakly, tried to raise himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene's hand pressed him back. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to get up yet, darling," she said, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came to him vaguely that she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">crying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then abruptly he remembered. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a single fleeting glimpse of the knob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed club hurtling at him, with Raa's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted face behind it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Raa!" he snarled, and despite his swirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing senses, despite Helene's restraining</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, he plunged up. "She did it! But</seg><seg type="columnLine">why? She was helping. "He broke off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"N'Gesso?" he demanded. "What about</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From a corner of the room, a shaky</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice answered, "I am alive. Think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman could succeed where a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">men have failed ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor gave a relieved grunt, raised a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautious hand to his throbbing head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What trickery is this, Helene?" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded. "My mind reels so, I can make</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sense of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when Helene, with Arnsdale's help,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finished the incredible story, Ki-Gor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain had been shocked into chill clarity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the idea of using apes for slave</seg><seg type="columnLine">raids, isn't all," Arnsdale told him, "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned something else!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was still daylight when they put us</seg><seg type="columnLine">in here," explained the lieutenant. "Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">most everything is in ruin, we found a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of letters and papers in some cabinets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunks. We wondered why we were put</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, why the house looked like the owner</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just gotten up one day and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arnsdale's voice was trembling with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We found this was a Dr. August Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery's place, a kind of experimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">station. Seems he was carrying on some</seg><seg type="columnLine">complicated study of gorillas. His wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and five year old daughter were with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The way we figure it, Raa is that daugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes!" broke in Helene. "Her name</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Roberta. Some sudden tragedy must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have happened, a native raid or an out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">46	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">break of the gorillas he kept for study--</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's a big row of steel cages outside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyway, everyone except the child must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been wiped out suddenly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though a bit unsteady on his legs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Gesso had come up to listen. Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursed his lips, and in the moonlight you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see his eyes narrow in thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It could happen, I suppose," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly." Some of the very young apes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were probably treated like pets. Left a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lone, the child would turn to them for com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panionship. And there would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">food enough stored here to keep her alive</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the older apes took her in or she lear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ned to forage herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His musing was interrupted by the prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical-minded N'Gesso.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One would rather speak of escape,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">sourly advised, "instead of how that she-</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil was spawned. My knife, blowgun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">darts, all are gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene moved closer to Ki-Gor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Slaker had your weapons taken," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said angrily, "and he was the one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted us put in here.

But his efforts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We may as well sleep," he said finally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sleep?" declared the astounded Arns-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dale.

It seemed to Arnsdale that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White Lord fell asleep almost imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately. And like a nervous child, calmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the presence of a parent, Helene drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped off a short while later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lieutenant turned to look for</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso. The pygmy was sprawled on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor, his arms thrown wide, snoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly. Arnsdale was both distressed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointed. He had expected swift</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">deeds, some miracle of high adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Ki-Gor, yet here the supposed jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">hero slept away the hours like a dullard</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to realize they might be his last</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jove!" he thought. "I've overesti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mated them all. They've just given up</seg><seg type="columnLine">like whipped dogs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor lounged by the window, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly out the window. His complete im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobility exasperated the lieutenant. Nei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther his face not his manner showed any</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of worry, and from Arnsdale's view-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, there was certainly little sense, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that matter coherence, in the few re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks the White Lord did make.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That scarred ape is pretty much the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss after Raa, isn't he?" Ki-Gor asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," answered Helene. "They all</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump when he growls. She's the queen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he's definitely the prime minister.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jungle man shrugged. "Nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was just thinking how odd it was for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to follow a female.

Then he turned around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked over to Arnsdale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Could I see that ring you wear?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Arnsdale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lieutenant sighed, disgustedly thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN CLAWS OF RAA	47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand out. What a time to be looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a ring, he thought. To his surprise, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of bending to see it, Ki-Gor reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slipped it from his finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's merely a good luck ring my girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave me," he said testily.

That rat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced feighter would have taken it, other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor inspected it closely, even testing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his fingernail the tightness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four metal prongs which held the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting in the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can use it," Ki-Gor said, after try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it on his little finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lieutenant choked back a caustic</seg><seg type="columnLine">question as to what possible use a worth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less ring would be. After all, he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered, what difference did it make. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle man was too childish to argue with</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he thought he could bribe one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bantus with the ring. Arnsdale wearily</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded he could have it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To his dismay, he saw that Ki-Gor im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately pried the prongs open and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the stone. Before he could protest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White Lord called N'Geeso to produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poison pellet. The poison was thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">like resin, and using a splinter of wood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor carefully covered each of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prongs with it, smeared the remainder on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mounting. When he was finished, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped the ring into his empty knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">scabbard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A disturbance outside interrupted them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door flung open and a group of apes</seg><seg type="columnLine">led by Mog, pressed into the room. Sla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ker appeared in the doorway behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts. His little, rat-like eyes darted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor, ignoring the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm about ready to begin on you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smart boy," he grated venomously. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">gonna make you wish you'd never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">born. Sam Slaker's gonna have his inn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing now, and what an inning it'll be."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pale scar of his mouth broke apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a wolfish grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Kt-GOR gave no sign he knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laver was in the room. The White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord's whole attention was centered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mog. He walked slowly three paces past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ape, looking him up and down. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorough-going change had altered the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle man, transforming his very features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arnsdale studied him queerly, an odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation pricking his skin. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something suddenly menacing about Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor. He seemed to have grown larger, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath his bronzed skin the great mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles had come alive, swelling into writhing</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his slow, stiff-legged walk, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">taut set of his body was an animal bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligerance. "That's it!" realized Arnsdale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've seen dogs bristle that way when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were about to fight." And he was certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his interpretation when Ki-Gor's lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheared abruptly back over his white teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a deep, rumbling snarl ripped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mog had stood rrfotionless, only his</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-rimmed, glittering eyes alive, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the White Lord parade before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. But though not a muscle on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant frame moved, so abnormally quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">was he, the stiff short hairs along his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck rose stiffly. One could feel, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than see, an electric tension build up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brutish though he was, Mog recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">and did not like the insulting challenge of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered by this hairless man-thing. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mog, the Feared One! Never in his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he given ground before any animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had mauled every bull in the tribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">into submission. He had fought Kra,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Leopard, and won. He had broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tar, the Lion, in his great hands like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotten stick. When he roared his anger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all jungle creatures fled from his path, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew and feared him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raa had said not to slay this Hairless</seg><seg type="columnLine">One, but Raa did not know of this insult.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mog heard how quiet the other bulls had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become. They sensed, too, that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange man-thing was challenging Mog</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, challenging him as another bull-ape</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do. And they waited for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader to crush the Hairless One as he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">all who dared oppose him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mog's anger grew, building up until</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Ki-Gor snarled, the giant brute's</seg><seg type="columnLine">control snapped. He gave a thunderous</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar, and shoving fully erect, pounded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast expanse of his chest with knotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Ki-Gor!" screamed Helene. "He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to charge!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slaker, realizing too late what Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">48	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had precipitated, cried shrilly, "You fool!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'll tear you to bits!" And then as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought struck him that Ki-Gor was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberately committing suicide to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">torture, Slaker cursed vilely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither Arnsdale nor N'Geeso spoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officer because he was too bewildered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso because, guessing Ki-Gor's pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose, he was too awed by the jungle man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve to think of his own safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before Mog could charge, Raa burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the door and leaped in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. She spoke rapidly to the ape, patting</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smoothing him, and gradually she</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged him out of the door. He went with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, but his angry growls told that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger was far from being quenched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as she got Mog away, Raa re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned. "You-do-that!" she rasp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed at Slaker, apparently believing he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to goad Mog into killing the prison-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers. Then, her lips curled with contempt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she smashed him in the face with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. He staggered back, cowering before</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She gave a guttural command to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apes and immediately the beasts seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoners, began roughly dragging</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from the house. Raa stalked ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, leading the way past rotted, col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapsing buildings to what had been a broad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">open field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the center of this field were gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly a hundred Ingagi, both bulls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she's. Raa sat down on a raised mound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dirt and the prisoners were brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">before her. Mog came out of the crowd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking stiff-legged, and stood by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mound. His red little eyes glittered at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suu-laa-kur!" summoned Raa. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaver, who had been sulking in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">background because he feared the girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrath, hesitantly came forward. "Talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">them," she commanded. "Say what Raa</seg><seg type="columnLine">do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hangdog air dropped from the slav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er. He saw she wasn't angry at him. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to go ahead with the plan he so</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunningly had sold her on. He wet his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale lips with his tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Raa and I are going to call on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pygmies," he began silkily.

"No comment?" he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mock surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "N'Geeso spat in the dust, looked away</seg><seg type="columnLine">disinterestedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you've decided your hairy brothers</seg><seg type="columnLine">aren't such wonderful slave-gatherers af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter all," taunted Helene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It isn't that, my dear," said Slater hate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. "Pygmies are no good as slaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves, but they can catch slaves. We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">save the apes for other jobs, things like</seg><seg type="columnLine">going in and finishing off the little devils</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they've weakened themselves enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">warring on other tribes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The loud trumpeting of an elephant</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded from the jungle off to Ki-Gor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. As the sound ended, the sharp clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack of breaking branches could be clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly heard. An elephant herd was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">move, foraging for tender leaves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoots as it moved unhurriedly through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The apes stirred restively, muttering</seg><seg type="columnLine">among themselves. They didn't like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephants being so close.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAKER turned to Raa. "Tell them</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's the same herd," he said impatient-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, "that's been tramping back and forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">around here for days. The elephants mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">them no harm. Great Scot, they throw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit every time they hear an elephant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following his instructions, Raa quieted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ingagi. What Slaker said was true.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tuskers never sought trouble.

A great man like you should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be worth two hundred slaves by himself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor looked at him with distaste.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a fool as well as a coward," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said evenly, "if you think the pygmies</seg><seg type="columnLine">would believe your promise to free us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as to Tembu George--well--I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'll have his own ideas on this prisoner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The elephant herd had come consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably nearer. As he talked, one part of Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's mind followed the beasts, gauging</seg><seg type="columnLine">their distance and their number.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tembu George is no brighter than</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN CLAWS OF RAA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you," sneered Slaker. "We're going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take him with the same trick." He ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained that Raa had left two apes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night before at the spring. 'Whenever</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gets that far, the apes will hurry here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tell Raa. She'll go into her act and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead the lambs into a foolproof ambush</seg><seg type="columnLine">of certain death."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">That was why so many Ingagi were</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembled. Raa was going to throw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole tribe against the Masai. Though Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor gave no outward sign, worry gather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And as to the pygmies, they'll do our</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidding, all right," continued Slaker. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">face had grown more evil, and hate was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hot madness in his eyes. "You see we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to show them two realistic examples</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what will happen to N'Geeso, Tembu</seg><seg type="columnLine">George, and you if they don't get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves and quick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and pointed across the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">field toward three fresh mounds of dirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are three holes dug," he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained.

And then on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a zebra I taught her to ride, Raa is going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give a demonstration of her skill with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a club." He glanced around. "You follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">me ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He chuckled gleefully. That had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">them all sit up and take notice, even that</seg><seg type="columnLine">damnable Ki-Gor.

Going fast like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it isn't easy to crush a skull."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He babbled on, complimenting himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">on thinking up the fiendish idea. N'Geeso</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be put in the third hole, he explain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, to get an idea of what was in store</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him if his people failed to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But when we dump Helene and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier's bodies before them," declared Sla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ker, "they won't fail you.

Arnsdale asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, he meant it," Helene answered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-faced but in complete control of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">4--Jungle--Kali</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">herself. "He's an insane killer and Raa</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no more than an animal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that moment, Ki-Gor knew the great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est agony of his life. Gripped by three</seg><seg type="columnLine">massive brutes, he was held helpless as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">child. Helene was to be brutally slain be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore his eyes and he could do nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent it. He felt his own sanity reeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Raa barked the order for the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners to be buried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ape-guards lifted the victims, start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed at a run toward the freshly-dug holes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get zee-bra," the blonde told Slaker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he hurried away toward one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumble-down buildings, she strolled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to supervise the placing of the prisoners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a rend of breaking wood, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small dead tree at the edge of the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">toppled over. A grey bulk appeared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening where the tree had been. Laz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily, the elephant ambled onto the field, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no more than a glance at the apes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned westward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OTHER huge beasts appeared behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first elephant, until the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd of twelve, three of them young ones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was grazing a leisurely path to the west</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the edge of the field. Mog snarled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this intrusion and the apes holding Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor bristled angrily though the uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned elephants were fully two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards distant and moving further away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with every step.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ki-Gor had grown more rigid than</seg><seg type="columnLine">his captors. He recognized the vast beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading the herd as his own half-wild pet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marmo. Though the great bull ordinarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained near Ki-Gor's camp, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown restive in the long absence of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">master and had sought companionship</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his own kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A desperate idea exploded in the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord's mind. If only he could attract</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marmo, he might have a fighting chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help Helene. He shouted with all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">might, "Marmo! To Me!" startling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apes holding him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The giant bull's trunk hesitated on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to pluck a mouthful of grass, the tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous ears shifted. Ki-Gor cried his</seg><seg type="columnLine">name again and the bull slowed, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head. The apes had no inkling of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">their prisoner was attempting, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoved him roughly, not liking his actions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raa spun and stared hard at the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">50	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man, but she didn't suspect his motives</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more than the brutes. Despite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatment given him, Ki-Gor kept crying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Marmo, and gradually the elephant</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung about. The giant would come for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward a few yards, then stop as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled, peer about nervously Until Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor called again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strong Ingagi smell smothered Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's scent, and the tusker couldn't under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand why his master's familiar tones sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moned him, when he could neither smell</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor see the White Lord. But by fits and</seg><seg type="columnLine">starts, the giant came on until he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">within an easy spear throw of the apes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ingagi grew terribly disturbed. Fe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">males knuckled about locating their young,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the bulls, thinking they were threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened by the elephant, grew belligerent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One ape released his hold on Ki-Gor, lum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered about, bellowing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slaker arrived at a gallop on Raa's</seg><seg type="columnLine">zebra. From a distance, he had heard Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's cries, seen the huge elephant draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer. He understood instantly what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle man was about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't you see he's calling that blasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster?" he burst out at Raa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her brow creased in surprise. To her</seg><seg type="columnLine">an elephant was a creature to be given</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide berth. It hadn't occurred to her that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor could call a beast out of a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd. With a swift, wrathful command,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she told one of Ki-Gor's guards to clap a</seg><seg type="columnLine">paw over the jungle man's mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deeply concerned, she appealed to Sla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ker for some way to drive off the tusker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She explained that the apes were growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">so angry they might try to attack the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant and many would be slain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slaker pointed to where club-wielding</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorillas guarded his Bantus. The suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious Raa took no more chances with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks than she did with Slaker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Free my men and let them use those</seg><seg type="columnLine">clubs," he demanded. "That devil is just</seg><seg type="columnLine">tame enough not to hurt men, yet he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild enough not to trust strangers. We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">get rid of him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as Raa complied with his wish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">es, Slaker leaped off the zebra, rushed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men between the apes and Marmo. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer hearing Ki-Gor's voice, the tusker</seg><seg type="columnLine">had halted and was eyeing the angry mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of apes in puzzlement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marmo was confused. The men sound-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STOR1ES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ed angry and shook weapons at him. Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">this some kind of trap ? Had he only</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he heard Ki-Gor?

He reached out and pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor angrily in the face. He snarled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapped hard again. Suddenly, an agonized</seg><seg type="columnLine">look contorted his face, and seconds later</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mar mo had swung about at the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord's call, and there was a more danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous note in his trumpeting this time when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he faced the line of Bantus. If only Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor could get to him, he might yet scatter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ingagi long enough to save his wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and friends. But what chance did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle man have to reach the elephant?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apes were all about him, blocking every</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenue of escape. The nearest beast was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge Mog who had turned in time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the second ape-guard fall. Raa, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily speechless with surprise, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at the jungle man. In another in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant, the blonde girl's lashing voice would</seg><seg type="columnLine">send the whole tribe leaping in on Ki-Gor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For any other man it would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end. But with his knowledge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild, Ki-Gor had one last thin thread of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope, a thread so slender that only extreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperation could have driven even him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp it. It was a strategem for which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had laid the groundwork when Slaker and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mog first came to take him from the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor had deliberately goaded Mog</seg><seg type="columnLine">to battle fury in the room. He had chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenged the ape leader as another bull would</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. He had done it because he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was Mog's brawn that actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruled the tribe. Perhaps Mog was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pets Raa had grown up with. In any</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, he was the weapon she used to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ingagi in line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And if Ki-Gor could trick Mog into</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepting individual battle and could de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">feat him, then by ape standards the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">man would have won for himself the scar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">red ape's place and standing in the tribe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After all, it was not a far step from accept-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Raa as one of their own kind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepting the White Lord. But the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick was to .make Mog and the tribe look</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him as a challenger seeking to supplant</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scarred ape in the tribe, rather than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man fighting for his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That plan had been in Ki-Gor's mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he left the room. That was why he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had prepared the poisoned ring, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">without the deadly pygmy poison he could-</seg><seg type="columnLine">n't hope to defeat Mog. But the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slaker had guided matters Ki-Gor never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had an opportunity to put his plan in</seg><seg type="columnLine">action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now when he had to fight Mog or die</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the rush of the whole tribe, the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">already had been used twice and the fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther effectiveness of its poison was doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful. Ki-Gor knew- how terrible was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gamble he took, but his only other alter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">native was worse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor slid the ring on the little finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his right hand. He swelled his chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its fullest expansion, battered it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his open palms, and with perfect mimicry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared the challenge of an angry ape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took three quick steps toward Mog,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped to repeat the roaring and chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating. Mog bristled, a cavernous rumble</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling from his throat. Ki-Gor turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strode arrogantly back to the two dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">apes. He put his foot on one of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving the wierd, chilling gorilla cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mog could not mistake his purpose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Hairless One was boasting that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had slain the two guards and that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would slay Mog as easily. Like searing</seg><seg type="columnLine">volcanic flame, rage burst up in the scar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">red ape. He watched Ki-Gor make</seg><seg type="columnLine">another short rush toward him snarling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scowling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raa was shouting then for the tribe to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarm at the White Lord. But she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too late. With a single shattering scream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mog rooted them where they stood. Twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">had this puny man-thing dared affront</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Twice had this two-legged white</seg><seg type="columnLine">grub faced him with an arrogance no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle denizen would have the courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to assume.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, no power on earth would keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mog from taking the Hairless One in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">52	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">great arms and crush him to a pulp. For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten in the red swirl of his anger were</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raa and her vaguely understood scheme</seg><seg type="columnLine">of holding men in bondage. Forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the elephant and Slaker and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious ease with which the man-thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">had killed the two guards. Mog bellowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wrath to the tribe, signalling his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention of personally destroying this chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenger. And then, snarling steadily, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged forward, wanting to get close enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take Ki-Gor with a single rush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as the hideous giant knuckled for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, the White Lord suddenly streaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, smashing his right fist against the scar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">red cheek and spun away. Mog shook the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground with his roars. He was outraged</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the man should be the first to attack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he wasn't hurt. A score of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows landing simultaneously wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have shaken his muscled bulk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He raised to his full height, his tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous arms outstretched. His beady red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaked eyes watched his quary for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Then abruptly he charged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ki-Gor had known how Mog would</seg><seg type="columnLine">react and he was ready. As the bull thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered down on him he waited until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last possible second, then ducked low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided the giant paw that hammered at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. As he slid under the upraised arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he raked the ring across the brute's belly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before the jungle man could get set</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, Mog had spun and was rushing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Ki-Gor summoned every bit of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, tried once more to avoid the club-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing arms and dive past the beast. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">raging gorilla wasn't to be caught by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same trick twice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mog whirled with him, handling his</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense weight with cat-like quickness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and balance. And as he whirled, the bull</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected a round house blow with Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's shoulder. It was his forearm, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the granite like mass of his paw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord was torn from his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent twisting ten feet through the air, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole left'side paralyzed by the blast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain. He fell hard, rolling to a stop on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stomach. Mog thundered toward him</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone utterly berserk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor fought to get up, knowing death</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed upon him. But for once in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life his magnificent body couldn't respond</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to his commands. His nerves and mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles needed time to recover from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful power of that blow. Yet there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More by sheer will than strength Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor scrambled his way to his knees. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he could never make it. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no chance to escape the beast, and Mog's</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream of triumph showed he realized, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">his victim couldn't get away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT KI-GOR, dazed as he was, meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to die trying. He gathered his numb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivering muscles, and then abruptly, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a startled frog, he threw himself sideways</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the charging ape's ankles. He barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung beneath the reaching paw, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit his target squarely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gorilla's feet shot from under him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His vast bulk, going at full tilt, suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">reversed its whole position, with his heels</seg><seg type="columnLine">going high and his head whipping toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. He drove face first into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, striking with the force of a falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite the terrible fall, Mog was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet almost as soon as the White Lord.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though he was slightly shaken, the brute's</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest annoyance came from the dirt he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had plowed into his eyes and mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spitting and roaring, he pawed at his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his squat, stump-thick legs already braced</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another rush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The watching apes were silent. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious to them the end was near.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though by their standards the battle had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly begun, they saw the White Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plainly unsteady on his legs, his lungs</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboring to pump oxygen into a body</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken by the two collisions. Mog would</seg><seg type="columnLine">get him on his next lunge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To their amazement, however, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor who drove forward first. Any</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectation they had of seeing him actual-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly make a fight quickly faded. The jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">man swung a disappointingly ineffectual</seg><seg type="columnLine">over hand-blow at Mog's face, missing by</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully two feet, and then jumped back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What the Ingagi didn't know was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor had slid his ring from his finger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted forward just as Mog bellowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not enough poison was left on the pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">prongs to harm the bull when Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit or scratched him, but a glance had</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN CLAWS OF RAA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">S3</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">told the jungle man that there was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the death-dealing resin caked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the actual mounting. He had taken ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of Mog's momentary blindness</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cast the entire ring into the beast's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, throwing it hard enough to lodge it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his throat for an instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mog choked, struggling to dislodge the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring. "With a tremendous cough, he raked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it from his throat, caught it with his tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">and furiously spat it out. Then he raged</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward at the jungle man, running erect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his long arms extended to net his prey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor tried to dodge him, weaving and</seg><seg type="columnLine">back-pedaling desperately, but like a steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamp one great paw slammed closed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder. With that single hand, Mog</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted the White Lord and jerked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his chest. The ape lashed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">other arm about Ki-Gor's back, and apply-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bone-breaking pressure, he bared his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fangs and bent to tear out the jungle man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor squirmed and fought, but a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gainst such brute power he was utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless. He saw the cruel mouth open</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide for the death bite. And then a's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous head bent for his throat, a violent</seg><seg type="columnLine">spasm wrenched Mog's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor felt the arms about him jerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly and suddenly the crushing pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him was gone. The ape was sagging</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him, making odd croaking noises</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his throat. The poison had taken effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor braced himself against the beast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">began battering with his hands and utter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blood-curdling snarls. When the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of the gorilla came against him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't support it, so he caught the hairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">body and made it seem he was throwing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went down with the dead ape, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuing his play-acting by mauling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">choking until it should seem that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain Mog with his bare hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he sprang away from the still</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, hammered his chest and roared a</seg><seg type="columnLine">victory cry. He swung slowly about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing at the astounded Ingagi. Raa</seg><seg type="columnLine">was staring at him, dumb-founded by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift and utterly unexpected victory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor stalked beligerantly a few paces</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth past the body, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">growling, he walked directly toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">massed apes. To his well-hidden relief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall of hairy bodies split apart before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He sidled at a snail's pace, growling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turning his head as though searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some bull who thought like Mog to</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenge his might.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he was past the apes, his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">racing with the strain of the bluff he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">successfully carried out. He put his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his mouth and called Marmo. A mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering broke out among the Ingagi behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Ki-Gor paid it no heed. He leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, sprinted toward the elephant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slaker and his Bantus lay between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord and Marmo, but the tusker</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized his master and trumpeting ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citedly, he started to meet him. The sla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver and his men tried furiously to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grey giant, but Marmo was certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">now of his master's wishes and he plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly at the blacks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ARMED with no more than clubs, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bantus scattered out of his path,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite Slaker's profane efforts to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Once the elephant got past, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaver turned his attention to Raa, shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for her to send the Ingagi at Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the front while he and the BantUs</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacked from the rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Judging by what he would have done in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his place, Slaker thought the White Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely trying to save his own skin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not until Marmo swung the jungle man</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto his head and then raced directly to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward where the prisoners were buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">did "the slaver realize what Ki-Gor in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kill them!" shrieked the running sla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver to Raa.

The fall, though, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given Ki-Gor the time he needed to smash</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the Ingagi, beat off the beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">that tried to clamber up the elephant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raa used her heels to spur the zebra</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a gallop, straining to outrun the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord. She would have beat him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the prisoners by seconds had she been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a better rider. But in her anxiety, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to control the zebra properly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor rode Marmo in at an angle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning to block off from Helene. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced horsewoman would have swer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ved abruptly, cutting behind the running</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant and reached her objective. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blonde girl turned the other way, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to outrun and cross in front of Marmo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord simply veered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge tusker suddenly, smashed into Raa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The zebra crashed down with its rider.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They both fell directly in Marmo's path</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the elephant's great feet pounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">over them. As Ki-Gor glanced back at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bloody pulp pounded into the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face tightened, but he could feel no</seg><seg type="columnLine">real remorse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In maneuvering to stop Raa, Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given the pursuing Ingagi' time to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">near. He had to drive them off long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for him to dig out Helene and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men. He headed Marmo toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apes, then slid from the elephant's back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marmo was aroused now and ready to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle with or without Ki-Gor's direction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he could rely on the mammoth beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">to scatter the gorillas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The earth was soft about the taut-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners, and by clearing their shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor was able to pull thdlm out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes. As he freed Arnsdale, the last one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor heard Slaker exhorting his Bantus</seg><seg type="columnLine">to close in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord looked for Marmo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw there was no chance to use the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant either to battle or outrun the Bantus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tusker had the Ingagi in headlong</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight across the field and was taking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody toll of the slower bulls. In his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">battle frenzy, Marmo was definitely be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond recall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor had known Slaker would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in from the field to try to stop their escape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he had counted on having Marmo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">help. Even had he, N'Geeso and Arns-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dale been armed, they would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to fight the slaver's force. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">odds were too great.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no choice but to make a run</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the forest.

Grim-faced, gun in hand, Quin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton crouched and waited for a head to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show above the tall grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raymer came galloping up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear, riding low in his saddle. Quinton</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched his progress with a puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown. Slugs were buzzing overhead like</seg><seg type="columnLine">bees, but no one had been hit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Get Jean on my horse!" Raymer</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted as he vaulted from the saddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A high-pitched twang like that of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plucked steel string sounded above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud reports of the muskets. Raymer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse whinnied and rolled over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," observed Quinton, "was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mauser. And the guy behind it can shoot!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shootin' at our horses but not at us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eh ?" said Raymer with quick compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hension. "Guess we're kind of fenced in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">son."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The firing stopped studdenly. Quinton</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to where the grass bent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed as if disturbed by an under cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he said: "They're creeping up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A HORN blared on their left. The un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors answered it in a thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous shout. As their battle-cry rolled across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veldt, painted shields flared above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow grass and the sun flashed on steel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like a black wave, the massed warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept down on them, their white plumes</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossing like spindrift whipped up by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jean screamed and covered her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her hands.

A line of warriors ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced upon them; then fanned out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a circle, crouching behind their shields</seg><seg type="columnLine">with out-thrust spears, and closed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're Ovambos!" muttered Quinton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ovambos!" he repeated incredulously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've been keepin' bad company,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawled Raymer. "I don't like the look</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your friends."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton was pointing to a spot above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heads of the warriors. A white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scrambling down the bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maddon!" Quinton said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raymer gave him a quick, understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing look: "You're in real trouble, son."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The circle opened and Maddon stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them, his rifle ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Drop your guns!" his voice boomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton obeyed. With a shrug Raymer</seg><seg type="columnLine">also flung down his rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four Ovambos jumped forward. They^</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITCH'S MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bound the wrists of both men behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">their backs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's on your mind, Maddon ?''</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinton asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll show yer!" Maddon took a pace</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and kicked Quinton's feet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">under him. Then .he walked over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinton's horse and came back with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whip in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton gritted his teeth as the lash</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell across his shouders. When the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurted, Maddon's hatred became a frenzy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bestial grunts came from between his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick, slobbering lips. Soon Quinton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt was in ribbons; his back a mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">raw flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You beast! You coward!" The girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice came to Quinton's ears.

"I'll lift your bleedin' 'ide, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pushed Quinton over with his foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and raised the whip to strike again.

He wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head dress of a chief,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bogembwe--you!" muttered Quinton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why--" The circle of faces whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">around hinx. He shook his head and gasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the pain that came with movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a cry the girl ran to him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped to her knees beside him.

He fainted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton spent the next few days in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of coma. The fever had come to add</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his misery, but it was the normal kind:</seg><seg type="columnLine">recurrent shakes and temperatures. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay on his stomach in a litter when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on the march and the chant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">porters and swaying of the hammock be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came a rhythm of agony. Vaguely he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his life was in the hands of Jean</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raymer. She was always beside him, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shield his lacerated back from the sun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to brush off the flies. When they made</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, she was there to dress his wounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and quench his thirst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Years of clean, hard living made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">an easy patient. Once the danger of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fection was past, the fever left him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he healed rapidly. On fhe fourth day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their march he declared himself able to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were half a day's march behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main column. Twenty young Ovambos</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed their guard. From Jean, Quinton</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned that her father and Maddon were</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the main column. Just before start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the following morning, the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of the guard came to Quinton:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Losako," said he. "It is Bogembwe's will</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you go unbound. * But it is death for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me if you escape."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will not disgrace you, warrior," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinton. "When Bogembwe was my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, he would not have killed a man for</seg><seg type="columnLine">so small a thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps he would not do so now, Lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sako. Nkoi wills it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nkoi! So, it is the Leopard's claws you</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, warrior ! How is that? Is Nkoi chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Kaokoveld ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The head man's face froze: "I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken," said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN HOUR later they were winding</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the veldt toward a brooding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangled mass of jungle. They followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line of least resistance, a river bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would become a torrent when light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning rent the black clouds gathering over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kaokovelds. They passed marshy</seg><seg type="columnLine">pools from which the egrets, disturbed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their approach, rose like feathers shaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a pillow in the wind. The ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">was strewn with hippo dung and the grey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghostly forms of baboons glided among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton and the girl were trudging</seg><seg type="columnLine">along side by side, when she suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked: "Where are they taking us?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bogembwe's kraal would be a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess," he replied, It's in the Kaokoveld</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot-hills. We should make it by sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why? What have we done?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton answered her with a question:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do you know what your father came here</seg><seg type="columnLine">for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it's about something Uncle Joe told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He's always going off somewhere to</seg><seg type="columnLine">build dams and bridges and leaving me</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind. He didn't want to bring me along</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time, but I changed his mind."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Uncle Joe--a missionary?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes." She laughed. "Knowing father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hardly seems possible, does it? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny part is they look so much alike.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's only a year between them and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Joe were to shave his beard, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't tell them apart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah!" exclaimed Quinton, and stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, as understanding came to him. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ovambo had recognized Raymer, mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken him for his missionary brother, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps. And The Leopard, a back-sliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">convert, remembering the secret he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once divulged, had pounced upon them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he could understand why his Ovam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bos had refused to go on safari with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and why Bogembwe had come so far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own territory to ambush them. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what connection could there be between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maddon, Cock Biles and Nkoi? And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the realization that the knowledge Raymer</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed was likely to cost their lives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck him with the force of a blow. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leopard would use his claws; silence the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced up as the head man strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why do you stand here, Losako?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man asked with a suspicious frown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The woman wished to rest, warrior."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So soon?" the head man looked dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gusted. "Do not take her to wife, Losako,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he advised. "She is lazy and could raise</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a sorry crop. March, Losako!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did he say?" asked the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, he said that I'd be a lucky man</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I got you for a wife."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, really!" She flashed a happy smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the dour-faced head man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> iQuinton lapsed into gloomy silence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trudged on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before noon they entered the shade of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest, a hot-house shade, damp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sultry. Streamlets linked the pools in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river-bed, and as they forced their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper into the jungle, the linked pools</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a sluggish river fed by the mists</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shrouded the mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the trail they followed began an</seg><seg type="columnLine">abrupt ascent. The noise of the river in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased in volume. By sunset they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on a plateau with miles of parkland</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretching out before them, and rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the foothills like a green tide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of making camp, they rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">for only an hour. Just before night came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they marched into Bogembwe's kraal called</seg><seg type="columnLine">7 otumbe, after Bogembwe's grandfather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fabled Croesus of Ovamboland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The village was more than the usual hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazard collection of bee-hive huts sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by a mud wall. It was a small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-built town, with cultivated ground on</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sides. On one side it was bounded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river and on the other, by a rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">krantz and steep cliffs, the deep shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their abrupt descent contrasting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the burned grass of the plateau above.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everywhere there were signs of planning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinton, who knew the town well, saw in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">the symbol of one man's bitter struggle to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift himself and his people above the dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody rule of witchcraft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they marched down the broad, well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept road that ran through the centre of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town, their guards broke up into two</seg><seg type="columnLine">squads and separated Quinton from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. They were led away to separate huts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Food was brought to Quinton by a firm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breasted Ovambo girl. She giggled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked, flirted with him scandalously but</seg><seg type="columnLine">would answer no questions. Anxious as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinton was to learn what had become of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raymer and Madden, he did not press for</seg><seg type="columnLine">answers. Patience was the highest wisdom</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Ovamboland and apparent unconcern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surest way to knowledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EARY after the long trek, and still &gt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">sore where the lash had bruised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribs, Quinton lay down on the hide couch</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as the girl left him. But worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed with him. It pursued him through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dreams in the form of a gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">leopard with flaming eyes--through mud</seg><seg type="columnLine">that clung to his feet and through a jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lianas that reached out to check his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight like so many vibrating tentacles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton awoke with the roll - of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums in his ears. A shaft of sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbed into the blackness of the hut</seg><seg type="columnLine">through its low doorway. Everywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was the rustle of movement. Splay</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet padded along the road past his door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITCH'S MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">way. The drums kept up their incessant</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamor, calling the Ovambos to the large,</seg><seg type="columnLine">open space before their chief's house</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the ceremonial dances were held</seg><seg type="columnLine">and judgments given.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Quinton was called out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunlight. He walked briskly towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bogembwe's house with two armed Ovam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bos following closely at his heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the villagers, men, women and chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren, were packed into the square. A path</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened for Quinton as he approached and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came to stand in a pool of sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemmed in by black, sweating bodies. Ray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer and his daughter stood facing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief's house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bogembwe sat on a stool under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloping eaves of his house, backed up by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Elders of the clan. His body guard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">young warriors made an imposing array;</seg><seg type="columnLine">their white plumes contrasting nicely with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black sheen of their muscular bodies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their long bladed spears butted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, painted shields resting against</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The witch doctors stood apart--a weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">group, grotesque, a composite of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil that could befall an Ovambo. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous masks smelled of fresh pigment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">attesting to the importance of the occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. Their necklets of human bones</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattled when they moved. Quinton's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed over them and came to rest on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are we no longer friends,- Bogembwe?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinton asked in English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have brought enemies into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, Losako," the chief answered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton pointed to Raymer and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl: "What harm can these two do to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ovambos?

A sharp gasp ran through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranks of the warriors and ended in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry growl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Quinton's anger had carried him</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond fear: "Who is this Nkoi?" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded, his voice ringing clearly. "How is</seg><seg type="columnLine">it that no man has seen his face? It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he is a cheat and a fool. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will destroy the Ovambos!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bogembwe strode up to him, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing with anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be quiet, you fool!" Then his deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice addressed the Elders: "Losako is</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry with us because he cannot help his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends. Could he be otherwise and be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Losako the Ovambos know as a true</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Elders jabbered among themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few moments. Then a white-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow, their spokesman, stepped forward:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It could not be otherwise, O, Chief."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He announced their decision. "But let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth be shown to Losako, so that his anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be turned from us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let it be so, Wise Ones!" Bogembwe</seg><seg type="columnLine">affirmed. "I will talk with him later." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Quinton: "Go in peace, Losako!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I give you my hand."</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS THEY clasped hands Quinton felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piece of paper pressed against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm. He closed his hand upon it. Ray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer and the girl were staring at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jean gave him a faint smile. Raymer's ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression was enigmatical. They couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, he thought, that he held their</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances of life in the palm of his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps Jean thought he was leaving them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their fate. He wanted to talk to them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Bogembwe's eyes warned him away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as Quinton reached the se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion of his hut, he opened the note</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bogembwe had given him. All it said was</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Walk East through the village at moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton put a match to the paper and</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowned as he watched it burn. At least</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was clear that witchcraft had under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined Bogembwe's authority and he dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">not openly oppose the verdict of his witch</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor. What could he do in secret? Quin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton jumped to his feet and ground the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charred paper under his heel in sudden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">impotent anger. It was incredible that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven words could spell out the only hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had of saving Jean Raymer--the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would marry if she would have him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was so. There was nothing he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do without Bogembwe's help--without it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raymer and his daughter would die be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore sun-rise. Nor was it likely that he, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">witness, would be allowed to live to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tale. Poison in his food, or a bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Maddon's Mauser, perhaps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time Quinton sat on the hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">couch revolving plans. The mumble of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums broke in on his thoughts. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. The Ovambos were leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">square. From behind the trunk of a tree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he watched Raymer and Jean led away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemmed in by young warriors whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears flashed above the heads of a pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of women and children who cursed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spat upon the condemned pair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton made no attempt to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The less concern he showed the bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter for Bogembwe's plan--if he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly the sun inclined from its zenith,</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing down through an eternity to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crest of the krantz that brooded over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town, and where, in some rocky cavern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nkoi, The Leopard, watched and flexed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his claws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At moon-rise the ritual drums began to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">throb. Soon the deep bass voices of the;</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors were chanting tonelessly, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women kept time by clapping their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. The leaping figures of dancers-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled the fire that blazed in the centre</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the square. Coming from his hut, Quin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton glanced up and down the straight road.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was deserted. Bogembwe had chosen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good time for their tryst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton sauntered down the road and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the Eastern outskirts of the town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was about to retrace his steps when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard his name called softly. Bo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gembwe was standing in the shadow of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree. He whispered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have two hours, perhaps three. Fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low me." Without a word of explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">he started to run down a trail that twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the boles of great trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About a quarter o-f a mile beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outskirts of the village, they came to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing surrounded by a stockade of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharpened stakes as thick as a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">thigh and interwoven with thorn lianas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The man and woman are here," an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced Bogembwe as they came to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand before a narrow gate of thorn bush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guards?" asked Quinton tensely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chief smiled ..grimly: "Who en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters here needs no guard, Losako. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence guards him against the lion and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leopard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stakes enclosed a circle of ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flat arena. A row of saplings, stripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their lower branches, stood in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">centre like slender flag poles. Two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were bent over bow-like with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tips lashed to stakes driven into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. On their knees, bound to these</seg><seg type="columnLine">same stakes, were the drooping figures of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raymer and his daughter. Quinton knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that when the hour of execution came, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sapplings would be lashed to the hair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the victims. And when their necks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched taut, a fellow with a machete</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take a swing at it--the spring of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sapling would finish the job.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a cry he ran toward them, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife flashing in his hand. While he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slashed the girl's bonds. Bogembwe freed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raymer. Raymer swayed to his feet but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jean lay very still in Quinton's arms, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face white in the moonlight, her breathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely audible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long have they been here ?" Quin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton asked anxiously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITCH'S MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Since an h6ur before noon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Without water?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give her a little." Bogembwe thrust a</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin bag into his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton forced a few drops between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's bloodless lips. She moaned but</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not open her eyes. Raymer knelt be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side Quinton, forcing back the girl's eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lids as he said: "She'll be out for an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton noticed that Raymer's hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook: "You all right?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind me, son. Just get her out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can have anything I've got. I've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">through hell, watching her suffer.

If</seg><seg type="columnLine">they killed you, soldiers would come. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">people would not understand it. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would think that the soldiers had come, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have come, to steal and spit upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things they honor. They would throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves against the soldiers' guns and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would die. Your brother was a bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter man than you, Gold-seeker. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the gold of my fathers was hidden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he would not touch it. Nor would he</seg><seg type="columnLine">betray the trust black devils had in him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept their secret. But you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anger is before your eyes, Bogembwe,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">interposed Quinton quietly. "You cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">see my friend as he is. He would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken nothing without your consent. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed between us--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raymer checked him with a touch on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm: "I had that cornin' to me," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, and turned away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must go," urged Bogembwe. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman cannot walk, carry her." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and strode off toward the gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RAYMER and Quinton lifted the girl be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them and followed in his wake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They skirted the village and came out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trail that ran along the bank of the river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After they had gon some distance, Jean</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">declared herself able to walk with the help</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her father. Quinton moved ahead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell into step beside Bogembwe. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">became of the other white man, Maddon ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bogembwe pointed to the krantz that</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed out above them: "He is Nkoi's</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend. He went to the lair of The Leopard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that is where we are going, Losako,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because my young men dare not follow us</seg><seg type="columnLine">there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True," Quinton agreed. "They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch us before sunrise.

He shows himself to no man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he speaks with the mouth of his mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers. He is a shadow. The tricks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">witch doctors I understand, and I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to deal with them. But this Nkoi, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not understand him and I fear him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Losako. How can a man fight a shadow ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He is more cunning than the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is all, Bogembwe.

Well, because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I have done this night, I am a doomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. But I am not eager to die. If we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are to live, we must root out this wizard."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"True, Bogembwe!" Quinton approved</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a grim smile. "We get the wizard or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wizard gets us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later they were toiling upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the red rocks and dwarf aloes as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cending the hill by a series of terraces like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gigantic stairway. There were stretches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of narrow-leafed grass and scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">patches of bush lurking among the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand-stone boulders. The spoor of a lion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ess and two cubs crossed their trail and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain reibok stood out in silhouette on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pedestal of eroded red rock. Vast cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses hovered over the crags of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaokovelds, the bright moon was behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and drew an outline of dazzling light</seg><seg type="columnLine">along their black edges. A flash of light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning illuminated their interior with a fit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful transparency. The crash of distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder shook the solid hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton and Bogembwe reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plateau before Raymer and the girl. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood looking about, dwarfed by the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulders and slabs of sand stone which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fretted into weird shapes by wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rain. A few hundred yards ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the sheer face of a cliff loomed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to present an lftipassable barrier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinton was thinking of Maddon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rifle . But Bogembwe troubled by less</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangible fears, touched his arm and said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is an evil place to come to at night."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A man with a rifle among the rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be more dangerous in daylight, Bog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">embwe. Is there a path beyond the cliff ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Only the witch doctors know. Who but</seg><seg type="columnLine">wizards and men doomed as we are, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to this place?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A white man in search of gold, Bog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">embwe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, but he is Nkoi's friend."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton smiled grimly. "If Nkoi can</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep his friendship when once he has seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gold, even I will believe that Nkoi is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wizard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raymer's voice called to them as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up over the rim of the escarpment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jean clambered up beside him. White</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin showed through, revealing rents in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her shirt and jodhpurs and blood where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thorns had torn her flesh. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too exhausted by the climb to talk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched herself out with a groan under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thorn bush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is it!" said Raymer. "It's just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe described it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton was chewing on the biltong</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bogembwe had produced from his bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">and did not speak.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A FEW yards beyond their starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, they left the trail and worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way toward the face of the cliff in</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift rushes from rock to rock. Quinton</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed as the moon came out from behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds. It was a witch's moon--a moon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the jackals howl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon the black shadow of the cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread over them. Bogembwe pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently as Quinton came to stand beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The face of the rock reflected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickering light of a fire. Without ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">changing a word they crouched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled toward it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They had covered another twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards when the orange flames showed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">between gaps in the rocks. The outlines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two figures were seated before the fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The skin of one showed white and Quin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton recognized Maddon's burly torso. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other was a small weazened person, wear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a leopard skin, the head and claws</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging loosely from his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nkoi!" breathed Bogembwe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they watched, another figure emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the mouth of the cave and crept to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward them, his black skin almost invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shadow of the cliff. Quinton</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched his approach with a puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown. Evidently' the fellow was trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pass the fire without being seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the black approached the circle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire-light, he sprang upright and made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dash for the cover of the rock. Quinton</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Maddon spring to his feet. The black</seg><seg type="columnLine">was within ten yards of them when a spurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flame flashed before Quinton's eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The runner coughed, turned a somersault</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lay still. The jackals stopped their</seg><seg type="columnLine">howling. The report of the rifle re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoed along the face of the cliff and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was swallowed in the breathless silence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">*the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maddon was advancing upon them, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle held at the ready, evidently coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the effect of his shot. The wizard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nkoi, remained by the fire, peering out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A grim smile came to Quinton's face as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he watched Maddon's cautious approach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nkoi and Maddon's rifle were the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">that worried him most and he saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck was offering him a chance to rid him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self of both.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They do not know we are here, Bog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">embwe," he whispered tensely. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man is mine; the wizard is yours!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah-h!" Bogembwe sighed and faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quinton crawled forward on his belly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crouched behind a rock a few feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the spot where the black had fallen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crunching of Maddon's boots on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose gravel stopped. Quinton heard him</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunt as he bent over his victim; then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crunching started again as he turned away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinton slid around the rock and sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The force of his rush knocked Mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don off his feet.

Maddon</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelped and writhed in a frenzy of terror,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently believing himself attacked by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some beast. With a roar he struggled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet, lifting Quinton with him. Quin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton jumped clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maddon gasped in relief as he stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">fet Quinton. "I thought you was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leopard!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It might add up to the same thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maddon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You ain't got your bleedin' whip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mister!" Maddon's teeth showed in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly, confident grin. His hand slid down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his holster. But he was built like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ox and as slow as one. The gun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked from his hand as soon as he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">it clear of the leather, and Quinton had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit him twice while he mouthed an oath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swift and sure-footed, Quinton circled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other's huge bulk, avoiding the power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful arms that clutched at him and strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hard blows whenever the other passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from shadow into moonlight. Inside of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes he had the hairy, baboon</seg><seg type="columnLine">face mashed into bloody pulp. But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">man versus gorilla. Maddon was still on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet and Quinton realized with a thrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dismay that Maddon was taking all he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could give, deliberately wearing him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, waiting for a chance to close and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crush him in a bear-like hug.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Maddon sprang at him. Quin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton struck desperately. He felt the other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge hand clutch his shoulder and twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, leaving his coat behind him. Mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don lurched after him, the steel of a hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing knife flashed in his hand. Instinctively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinton drew his own knife from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a moment the two men looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other and the light in their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as cold as the glint of moonlight on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steel in their hands. It was an instinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive pause such as comes when the warm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsing heart feel the approach of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Maddon's snarl broke the spell. He flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself at Quinton, his knife sweeping up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward in a murderous arc, aimed at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach. Quinto felt the blade burn his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh as, in one swift movement, he par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried the stroke with his left arm and side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped. He drove his knife at the other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, but Maddon caught his wrist in his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, twisting the knife from his grasp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a last despairing effort Quinton crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his free fist into Maddon's face. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shock of the blow up to his shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it stopped Maddon. He staggered back</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pace and Quinton rushed in, striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">with right and left. ^Suddenly Maddon</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled up, sat down and then rolled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his stomach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dazed and gasping for breath, Quinton</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned away, vaguely wondering what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to Bogembwe. As he stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction of the fire, something</seg><seg type="columnLine">whizzed past his ear. He faced about with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a startled cry. He heard Maddon gasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw him fall back with the shaft of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spear sticking out of his chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bogembwe stepped out of the shadow:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Losako," said he, with a reproachful</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake of his head, "Did he knock the wits</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of you?

The crumpled, painted body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Nkoi lay before the fire, his hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound. Bogembwe ran forward and picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the scrawny body by the neck and but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tocks, showing the face to Quinton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Behold!

Kersten roared, fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, stumbled and his body sprawled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor. He leaped back to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with amazing agility for a big man, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking a bloody head like the maddened</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffalo from which he had gotten his name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A roar filled the Ivory Hut. Every white</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the place was after the black man. Af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter his head. A white stream flowed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">booths and tables. A Belgian policeman</seg><seg type="columnLine">was blocking the door, so Burack dived</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the open windows leading onto a ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">andah. Two native policemen were club-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing rifles. A brilliantly uniformed N.C.O.</seg><seg type="columnLine">was firing a Luger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burack yelled. "Run for it, Wara!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The big Masai grinned and made for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite side of the room, swinging the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big Masai sword like a scythe. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">headfirst through a side window like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of obsidian. A barrage of shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doorway was clear.

Then he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a service Colt out of his one-piece of can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vas luggage and checked it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had the gun gripped in his hand as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lay down across the insect-proof door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waited for Conklin to come back out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dark.

Her hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the kind of blonde that so strikingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes with bronzed skin, but of which most</seg><seg type="columnLine">blondes are only jealous. There was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing very businesslike, capable and effi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient about her, in contrast to McWilliams</seg><seg type="columnLine">who Burack finally managed to look at.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McWilliams was pale, attenuated.

Her long fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers trembled slightly.

They stood on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bow facing the wall of fetid jungle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vast expanse of almost impenetrable</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain-forest. A small cloud of sunbirds</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed like colored arrows after noisy me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">talic flies. Chimpanzees hooted derision</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the idiot white apes. A civet cat's icy</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream came from far up river. Absurdly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">short-legged Hippos charged snorting in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the water from mud banks, and croc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">odiles slid after them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the sun was beginning to set above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle heights in a riotous steam of</seg><seg type="columnLine">color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burack moved over and stood beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl. Her high strong brows and solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">little jaw looked a little fearfully at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle, and Burack couldn't blame her for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just take it easy now, Jean," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly. "We'll get out all right.

He dived for Conklin, roaring like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wounded bison. One hand slid his heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luger its canvas sheath. He'd forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burack. Jean cried out as Burack brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barrel of his own .45 down across Ker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sten's forearm. Kersten howled as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun spun across the deck. Swinging on</seg><seg type="columnLine">around with the momentum of his dive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kersten's clubbing fist caught Burack</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the right ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fireworks put on a beautiful and pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful display for him as he went stagger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blindly across the deck and bounced</seg><seg type="columnLine">off a rusted metal post.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kersten!" Dully, Burack was aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was Jean's voice that had sliced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air like a shrill knife.

Around it was a high wall, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white shining wall, gleaming like death's</seg><seg type="columnLine">final song in the sunlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a wall built entirely of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">skulls!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE N'GOWA, with Conklin's ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pert help, received them with a kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of silent, mysterious acceptance. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly thing, and no one expected it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">last. Kersten and his crew got one part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the village for huts, Conklin and Bu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rack McWilliams and Jean another sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jean went about the crazy business of</seg><seg type="columnLine">making plaster of Paris face masks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few whom she could persuade to submit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this indignity. And McWilliams, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boy-scout on an over-night hike, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounding about in the jungle catching</seg><seg type="columnLine">snakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was all very jolly, thought Burack</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly.

It was gibber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing terror, and pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is it, son," rattled Conklin, grab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing up his gun and running for the kraal</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate. Burack trailed him, keeping an eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sides of the jungle trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stopped quickly. Burack mopped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes, and tried to keep his hand steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the butt of his 45.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A ring of motionless giant N'gowa war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors with assegais and battle axes ready,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood around a dead body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A very dead N'gowa warrior was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawled out in the oozing trail half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile from the foraal wall of human skulls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The leopard skin had been torn from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body.

It wouldn't have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so bad, except that Burack saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead man--had no face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The face had been ripped away, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a weltering bloody mask that bubbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and frothed as the flies settled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burack held back violent sickness. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed away. Conklin twisted a corpse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">white face, and muttered.

"It's that damn Kersten's work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now we're getting the blame.

"Break up three more of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Toad hopped across the dim in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior of the hut.

The Toad</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned, his hand gripping a long curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife.

He felt bone crunch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood ripped from nostrils. He saw Conk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin dive through the hole of the hut and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappear. And then, from somewhere, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand appeared clutching a heavy revolver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burack tried to dodge, but the barrel de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended, hard, and repeatedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was hearing a long scream from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jean as he rolled over, feeling the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing darkness shattered with brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FULLY, layer by agonized layer, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness returned to Burack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He raised his head.

He was tied to the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">baobob tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ritual fires reached up hungry yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low tongues in the night toward the moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled sky.

His pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes watered as he stared wildly. His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">breath came in sharp painful gasps. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he turned and looked directly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burack, did Burack see what kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man McWilliams really was. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate, sensitive, but he was not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coward he had seemed to be. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">guts.

Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums were placed in a row before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims. Three drums. Three victims. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">living body entombed in each drum to die</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slow death of torture. But that wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for the blacks. On the Tree of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pain you suffered unspeakable prelimi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary torture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Witch-doctor, masked now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leering, made cabalistic signs over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three drums. Then the leaping dancers</seg><seg type="columnLine">began the last stage of the ritual dance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They leaped around and around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree, leopard skins glinting, rare animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails hanging from skins encircling waists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging and jerking. Crowns of brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathered plumes bobbing, swaying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Screaming pain. It went on and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">through blurred sweating mist. Torture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He let his fevered eyes drop.

"Where,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought Burack through foggy wet pain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"is Conklin?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the dancers the Chief, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mwanangwa, sat on his throne of skulls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The gigantic black joss outline watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the torture with eager eyes. Three hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred fat pounds of flesh, he sat chewing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a kilakilola root which caused his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">to exude a body-odor like cedar-wood. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord around his neck dangled five crim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son wing-feathers of the kuri-kuri bird.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Badges of distinction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">90	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kersten stood on the Chief's left. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right crouched the Toad. Behind stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white renegade, Hans. His mousy</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were wet with fascination as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the torture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The witch-doctor was leaping now in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantastic, stiff-legged dance. Burack dim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly knew that this was the end of the ritual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then something like hell exploded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The witch-doctor let out a long broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream of sheer terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something--something ghastly and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">human--was coming toward them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tombs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Or rather, it was raising up out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomb nearest the big baobob tree. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the rock road that led from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tombs to the tree. The blacks froze. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the apparition rising out of the tomb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a moan of hollow-sounding horror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A weird sonorous chanting. The sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">died and rose again, ululating in tomb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown echoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tomb had been that of a former</seg><seg type="columnLine">village Chief. And out of that tomb, stalk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward them, was a gleaming white</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeleton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PALE outline writhed toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, closer, emmiting its ghastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">moans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The witch-doctor was the first to run.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He yelled orders as he ran, for the blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring the sacred drums with them, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ghostly skeleton would contaminate</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. In a matter of seconds, the kraal</seg><seg type="columnLine">was empty, the drums gone. Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponderous outline of the Mwanangwa, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief, had managed to roll down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throne and waddle out of the kraal</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the dark jungle night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only Kersten, the Toad, and Hans</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained. And even they were crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fear, as the weirdly glowing apparition</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached. Only when the ghostly out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line had come within a few feet of Bu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rack did he recognize it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Conklin. And he was drunk. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was naked except for his shorts, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had painted a skeleton outline on his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">with phosphorescent paint. Though where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had gotten it, Burack couldn't figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Kersten had also recognized Conk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin. He roared with dark rage, pulled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Luger and began firing. Conklin</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ducked behind the tree. The swizzle stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthened into silver steel, licked across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bonds of the bound three. Tonga bark</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord fell away, and Burack dropped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dust. He managed to crawl behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunk of the baobob, to join Jean, Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams and Conklin. Bullets whined</seg><seg type="columnLine">around them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McWilliams was babbling wildly. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, before they could stop him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped up, yelling. Jean screamed as her</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother ran into the open, and kept on</seg><seg type="columnLine">running. Dust spurted around him as bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets followed. Jean started after him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burack held her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McWilliams was a mad figure, leaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bounding across the kraal, torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes flapping like a frightened scare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crow. His lanky length galloped out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kraal and disappeared into the wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We gotta get out of here," said Conk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin. "Those blacks'll be back. Kersten</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know whether to rush us here or</seg><seg type="columnLine">not. He may think I pack a gun. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">guys sneak through those bushes, around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the skull wall. I'll stay here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bluff them for a while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You were in the tomb," said Burack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How'd you get that skeleton disguise?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conklin grinned drunkedly. "I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">find my gun, so I had to have some liquor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Son. I knew I could get it in the Chief's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomb."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What? Gin?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, you idiot. Beer. Those tombs are</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided with sacred beer. A number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">big gourds are kept above the tombs, filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with strong native millet beer, son. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">made by three appointed virgins that know</seg><seg type="columnLine">their business.

To feed his lingering</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit with spirit. It was a simple matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">to transfer that reed to my own mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That millet beer's strong!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burack wanted to laugh, but his slashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was too sore. "But the phosphores-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent paint!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hell, can't you figure that out! That</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomb was full of bones, wetted down by</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries of rain.

Now you two vamoose out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started to argue with Conklin about</seg><seg type="columnLine">MASK OF THE SNAKE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that, but be didn't get the chance. Jean</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed as the big savage Muri warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Kersten's charged around the tree. Ker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sten came in fast behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A kind of blind suicidal rage filled Bu--</seg><seg type="columnLine">rack with a strength he could never oth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erwise have had under the circumstances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw Conklin slash out with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swizzle stick, saw a big Muri pick up</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jean and run with her, then he grabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kersten's running foot and brought him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on his face. Burack was swearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">insanely as he got to his feet, kicked Ker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sten in the face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kersten still gripped the Luger. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung it upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I only got my bare hands, Kersten,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burack screamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He wasn't surprised when Kersten</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliged. Burack couldn't see anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">else. Jean, Conklin, the Muris, anything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All he could see was Kersten's bulk ris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burack charged, fists flailing. Kersten</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared, met the charge head-on. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were standing close together, exchanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows. And then the Toad and Hans</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged Burack away. Hans let him have</seg><seg type="columnLine">it across the head with a revolver barrel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burack weaved, his legs wide apart to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold him up, blood running into his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Donnerwetter," roared Kersten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't do it," whined Hans. Mousy</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes glittered. "Don't fight him now, Jobi.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let the blacks slaughter him. Who cares</seg><seg type="columnLine">now about what we came up here to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">originally ? Conklin told us about them</seg><seg type="columnLine">tombs bein' loaded with treasure didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">he? I don't know why he told us, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sample--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burack wondered vaguely why Conk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin might have told them, then he knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or thought he knew, part of it. If Kersten</seg><seg type="columnLine">got interested in getting some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure for himself, then he'd forget any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other plans he might have had. Not that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his main plan wasn't busted up already.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not that anything could matter much</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. The big Muri black was still hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Jean's limp body in his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," agreed Kersten. "Tie them</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, leave them on the tree again. Let der</seg><seg type="columnLine">natifs have dem.

Burack watched Kersten and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men edge out of the kraal in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tombs. Sometime later, the blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned. Their fright had partly cooled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it got cold when they saw their vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tims tied, and helpless. They started sac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rificial rites, but Burack knew that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it would be short. Jean was still un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious and he was glad of that. Conk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin's skeleton painted body sagged life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW, BURACK was beyond pain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jean sagged in her bonds. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wet mist, he saw the three drums again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought back by the sweating blacks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again the N'gowa danced stiff-legged</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the drums.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the witch-doctor and his appren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tices were removing the thongs holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bull-hide drum heads. With silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">awe, the three apprentices threw aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stiff drum heads into the dust. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">made gestures. Then they reached inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drums. They were going to take out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old bones of former sacrificial victims,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burack mused foggily, then replace them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us. Jean and Matt and me. Me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burack, the young man who wanted ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture. He managed a dusty chuckle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The apprentices fell back, shivering</seg><seg type="columnLine">with horror. Three quaverous cries burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them. Those weren't bones rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from the drums.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were snakes! Spitting, venemous</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads darted out.

Struck and struck again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deadly contents of venom-glands shot in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the three howling apprentices. Enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">neuro-toxin in each stab to kill a man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a minute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burack's eyes bulged in incredulous</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror. There were spitting cobras, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirting venom from fangs that swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward when they spread yawning white</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouths, menacing hoods opening. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies' foreparts rose up like flexible foils</seg><seg type="columnLine">92	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from coiled spring-steel muscles beneath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three apprentices died quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conklin, conscious again, let out a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyous yell.
