                    <ab>Year after year you've seen my advertisement in all the leading publications, offering to teach you piano in quarter the usual time. Year after year my school has grown and
                        grown until now I have far more students than were ever before taught by one man. In 1922 over two thousand students graduated from my Piano or Organ course and received their
                        diplomas.</ab>
                    <ab>Yet when I first started giving piano and organ lessons by mail in 1891 my method was laughed at. Could my conservatory have grown as it has, obtained students in every State
                        of the Union, and in fact, practically every civilized country of the world, unless it produced very unusual and satisfying RESULTS for its students? See for yourself what it
                        is that has brought my method so rapidly to the front. Write for free booklet and sample lessons.</ab>
                    <ab>Now, for the first time, you can obtain sample lessons without charge. In the past, I have always been opposed to sending out free lessons, even to persons who were seriously
                        interested in my course. But my friends have insisted that I give everybody a chance to see for themselves just how simple, interesting and DIFFERENT my lessons are, and I have
                        consented to try the experiment for a short time. Simply mail the coupon below or write a postcard, and the 64-page booklet and sample; lessons will go to you at once
                        absolutely free and without obligation.</ab>
                    <ab>Within four lessons you will play an interesting piece on the piano or organ, not only in the original key, but in all other keys as well. Most students practise months before
                        they acquire this ability. It is made possible by my patented invention, the Colorotone. Another invention, obtainable only from me, is my hand-operated moving picture device,
                        Quinn-dex. By means of Quinn-dex you actually see my fingers in motion on the piano, and can learn just how to train your own fingers.</ab>
                    <ab>When I say that I can teach you piano in quarter the A usual time, do not think that this is too good to be true. Modern inventions and improved methods have accomplished just
                        as great wonders in other branches of education. You at least owe it to yourself to investigate. Send coupon or post-paid at once, before the offer of free sample lessons is
                        withdrawn.</ab>

                        <ab>"WE lived in a fairly comfortable home, but it was a terrific struggle to make both ends meet. I couldn't save a cent and I was deeper in debt than I dared confess to my
                            wife.</ab>
                        <ab>"I hadn't had a decent raise in years, and there were nights--too many of them now--when I lay awake for hours wondering what we would do if I ever lost my position.</ab>
                        <ab>"For other men were getting ahead of me and I knew that I couldn't stand still. I either had to go up or down. And I was afraid it was going to be down!</ab>
                        <ab>"Then suddenly one night it came to me like a Hash that the reason I wasn't getting anywhere was mainly because I had never made any definite effort to make myself more
                            valuable to the firm.</ab>
                        <ab>"I knew my own little routine job, but that was all. I was just one of the force to my employers. There was really no reason why they should think of me when a better
                            position was open.</ab>
                        <ab>"That night I made my decision. 'If the I. C. S. can raise the salaries of other men, I said to myself, it can raise mine. If it can help other men to win promotion and
                            have happier, more prosperous homes, it can help me, too. To-night, right now, I'm going to send in that coupon and find out what the I. C. S. can do for me.'</ab>
                        <ab>"It was the best move I ever made. My employers heard about my studying and started to take an interest in me. Six months after I enrolled with the I. C. S. I received my
                            first increase in salary. Within two years I was head of my department. And I'm going still higher."</ab>

                        <ab>An International Correspondence Schools course will help you just as it helped this man whose letter is reproduced here. It will help you to have the happy home--the bigger
                            salary-- the comforts that you want for your wife and your family.</ab>
                        <ab>For spare-time study is that vital something which makes one man succeed where one hundred fail--that lifts a man out of the rut and makes him a trained worker instead of
                            just a "hand."</ab>
                        <ab>One hour a day, spent with the I. C. S. in the quiet of your own home, will prepare you for the position you want in the work you liked best. Put it up to us to prove
                            it!</ab>

                    <ab>WHAT HAS OCCURRED IN PART</ab>
                    <ab>FANNIE GILLESPIE, a slim, blue eyed, brown haired girl, comes to the great city and eventually turns her pretty face toward the bright lights, as the sunflower to the sun, if
                        not as the moth to the flame. Her position is that of saleslady in an exclusive shop for women's hats, really an achievement for a country lass, but in this environment she is
                        envious of the rich clients who have diamonds and sables and motor cars. Fannie, in her pathetic rivalry, wears imitation gems and tries to approximate the extreme styles in
                        her cheap clothing. A guest in the boarding house, Henry Jordan, a filing cabinet salesman, is devoted to her, but she becomes indifferent to him when she learns that he does
                        not care for frivolous things and that his hope is to save money to marry her. Fannie cannot endure the thought of domesticity; this is her play lime of Youth. Jordan discloses
                        in a conversation with another boarder that he is in sympathy with any man who slays the woman who has destroyed his high ideals. Meanwhile, Fannie Gillespie keeps late hours
                        at dances and her escorts are of a swift type--a racing car driver, a beach amusement concessionaire, et cetera. She reveals, moreover, that she is in secret fear of some
                        pursuer, and this hint causes the police to suspect murder, and not suicide, when the laughter loving girl is found dead in her room.</ab>

                    <ab>If your rheumatism comes on again this year--</ab>
                    <ab>How can a medicine that is applied on the outside of the skin reach a pain deep down in the joints and muscles? This treatment acts by stimulating the brain to send new blood
                        to the affected area</ab>
                    <ab>DON'T suffer unnecessary pain. Get relief at once. It may be splendidly courageous to just "grin and bear it"--but it is a frightful waste of the very vital resources you need
                        to help you get rid of the cause of the pain.</ab>
                    <ab>Your doctor will tell you that pain should always be relieved -- just as quickly and as completely as possible.</ab>
                    <ab>And this relief is easily at hand. However deep-seated, however hard to reach the pain may seem to you, it can be stopped -- quickly and permanently.</ab>
                    <ab>Nearly fifty years ago a remedy for muscular pain was given to the world that has brought relief to so many sufferers that today you will find it in one home out of every
                        three.</ab>
                    <ab>This remedy is Sloan's Liniment -- probably the foremost household remedy in America, used all over the world and recommended by doctors everywhere.</ab>
                    <ab>No matter where the pain is, no matter how deep down in joints and muscles, it can be reached if the natural curative powers inside the body are only aroused.</ab>
                    <ab>When you use Sloan's, it stimulates the nerves on the skin. They arouse the brain, which in turn causes the blood vessels to expand throughout the painful area, under the place
                        where the liniment has been applied. Rich new blood rushes in.</ab>
                    <ab>This new blood coming, freshly purified, from heart and lungs, with all its marvelous germ-destroying, upbuilding powers brings to sick, pain-ridden tissues just what they need
                        to heal them.</ab>
                    <ab>This is the scientifically correct way to relieve pain. It doesn't just deaden the nerves. It gives your own natural bodily defenses the aid they need to drive out the cause of
                        pain.</ab>
                    <ab>Don't wait until you are in actual need. Get a bottle of Sloan's this very day, and have it on hand--35c at all druggists. Just apply it -- no rubbing is necessary, it will not
                        stain. Immediately you will feel a gentle warmth -- then a pleasant tingling of the skin -- then, almost magically, relief from pain. There is no burning, no blistering, only
                        quick, lasting relief.</ab>
