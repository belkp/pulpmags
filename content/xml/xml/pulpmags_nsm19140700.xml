He added, by the way, that the keynote of the New</seg><seg type="columnLine">Story is peculiar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   You will probably easily recall such stories of Mr. Russell's as</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Last Thing," "The Keeper of the Doors," and "The Exit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny Fing," to mention only three, which will bring back to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind vividly the strange, almost inexplicable "grip" with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">these stories seized upon your interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The quality of Mr. Russell's work that, to us, is most conspic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uous, is what we would call, for lack of a better term, its psychic</seg><seg type="columnLine">virility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It is a strange, impalpable thing, hard to define, chiefly because</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is something personal to the author--this color or atmosphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which qualifies and distinguishes everything that is written. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who writes imparts to his writing, in greater or less degree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of his own personality and this is what gives to the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is called "atmosphere"--a much abused and little understood term.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   But there are only a very few authors, especially of fiction, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">are gifted with the ability to make this vital in their stories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Joseph Conrad is one who possesses it to a very extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   John Edward Russell is another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   This peculiar quality of Mr. Russell's work has never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">more vividly displayed than in his new novel, "The Terror," which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we begin in this number of the New Story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It is one of the most remarkable stories we have ever read, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">for no other reason than for the sustained and consistent "atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere" which pervades it from beginning to end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">OURSELVES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   In almost every tale of eighty to a hundred thousand words</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is apparent, at certain stages, a falling away of interest, places</seg><seg type="columnLine">where you are conscious of a wandering of your attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It is usually due to the author's own lapse of interest, or fatigue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And so there is a disturbance in the story's atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Nothing of this kind is noticeable in "The Terror."

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown that had drawn Quentin's black</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows together deepened when he ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served that most of the passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">shared his dislike of the sunny side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat, but his quick eye caught a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacant place forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He beat a shivery little man to it, set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tling down with a sigh of huge satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and laughingly advised the refrig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erated gentleman to take the sunny</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and thaw out; whereat the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned and obeyed. Quentin ran a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick eye over the rest of the passen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers, observed no one who attracted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his notice except one very large, bull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">necked man in blue clothes and blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">derby, and thereupon cast out every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing from his mind save sky and sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the blue-ridged Catalinas ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was his first outing in three years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was enjoying it with his whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul--though he subconsciously noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the bull-necked man had very high</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood pressure, and that two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tourists were undoubtedly "lungers."</seg><seg type="columnLine">For, though Quentin had left his office</seg><seg type="columnLine">and practice behind, he could not leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">his profession likewise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had promised to meet Tommy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wells and Bunt Green, for a three days'</seg><seg type="columnLine">fishing trip down the coast, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">with some difficulty that he had gotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. While he was a young surgeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">--as surgeons go--he was both strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">of jaw and well established in Los An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geles ; having buried a few wealthy pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tients and cured at least one, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made both financially and socially.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy Wells and Bunt Green were</seg><seg type="columnLine">social lights who had more money than</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse power, and who confined them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves chiefly to the Country Club at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Catalinas, where they lived a lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guid existence on golf and fishing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">2</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Scotch and kindred pursuits. Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had cured young Green of fever im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pregnated with too much golf and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scotch, and, while by no means inti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate with the pair, he saw no reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">why he should not enjoy himself at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their expense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave his shoulders a little shake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking back at receding San Pedro, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flinging off all worries. Men said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allan Quentin was a good surgeon but</seg><seg type="columnLine">too hardened for his age; yet this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">because they noted his cold gray eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight mouth, and rather aggressive car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage, and utterly failed to note the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deftness of his fingers and the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightness of his smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus far, he had taken no notice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the occupant of the chair next to his;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now his attention was attracted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unusual movement on the part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man in the blue derby, whose eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fastened at his side. Quentin eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man, sized him up as a detective or</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain-clothes man--then shivered slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly at a light contact. He glanced down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see a hand stealthily approaching his</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a woman's hand, slender and</seg><seg type="columnLine">well shaped, perfectly manicured and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with unexpected dimples over each</seg><seg type="columnLine">knuckle. Its white perfection was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">adorned by rings, although he noted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle on one finger which told the tale</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a ring recently removed. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at the owner of the hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was leaning forward in her chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes fastened on the ocean, while a</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of faint anxiety was evident in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">features. Her whole attitude was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of strained concern, uncertainty; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as he looked down at her, the hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">left his coat. With a little sigh of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief, the girl settled back into her chair;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the look of half-fearful worry vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her face, and her hand dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her lap again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin was thoroughly puzzled. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">first thought was that she was a pick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket, for the Catalina boats made an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent place in which light-fingered</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentry could ply their trade upon tour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ists; also, the bull-necked man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue derby was unquestionably a detec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive, and seemed to be watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked down at her more keenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for women whose hands went explor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing were not apt to resent obtrusive</seg><seg type="columnLine">stares. But she seemed to have lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">all interest in him. It was as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">that quick, light touch on his coat had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent flying some wandering uneasiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and yet the notion was absurd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His gray eyes softened as he watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. The face was not beautiful, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still it bore an expression of patience</seg><seg type="columnLine">which lent it indefinable sweetness. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin it seemed that this expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been born of much suffer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, though she had no appearance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill health, in spite of the frailty of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat and arms. Her oval face had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad brow around which rippled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluster of golden-brown waves of hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Quentin suddenly found it hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye her with his usual indifference to</seg><seg type="columnLine">things physical.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had removed her hat and the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze was lifting her hair gently, loos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it and sending stray strands play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about her cheeks. A smile curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lips and she tossed her head back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward with a deep breath, as if she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not get enough of the salt-scented, sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then their eyes met--or Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought they did. And upon that, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceit received a sudden shock, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived that she was staring through</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, past him, as though he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">exist. He thought at first that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted his detection of that stealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, yet her face was quite calm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unflushed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" he said quietly, coolly forc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the issue. "Your hand is a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">light one, but I happen to be somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensitive to touch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He received another glimpse of ey«s</seg><seg type="columnLine">A.

They held a peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality in their violet depths--a quality</seg><seg type="columnLine">that caused him swift remorse at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own words, and sent unwonted sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathy into his face. Then she gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick little rippling laugh and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponded :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you caught me? Well, I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what kind of person you were!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin was anything but prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for such frankness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--but-" he hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why was I feeling your coat?

She reassured him, laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing softly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, I could tell from the feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether you were a gentleman or not."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sorry you couldn't tell from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">face," he smiled, amused. She turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">half away, a little flicker of pain cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her own face. "And how did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">class me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," she hesitated, still looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, "of course, I might make mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes, but I can often tell by the cloth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I have studied it-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why?" he insisted, wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she were trying to lie her way out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a difficulty. If so, it was a poor effort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't--can't you tell why?" She</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned swiftly, her face to his. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt that} swift quality of her eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he leaned back with a catch of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Forgive me," he said quickly. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself he added bitterly: "And I call</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself a surgeon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl was blind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, he had little chance to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flect on his own brutality, as he termed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, for she leaned forward confidingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let me look at you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her fingers ran lightly over his face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then she settled back without comment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" he urged, smiling a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guess!" She rippled out a laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon that, Quentin began to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself agreeable; she seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to get away from the topic of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her blindness, and yet she appeared- to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense the quick sympathy in him which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hidden from most eyes. His quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">poise had its effect, and soon she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">chatting and laughing with him, listen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to his description of the mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind and the sharpening outlines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Catalinas ahead with unalloyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">delight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It puzzled him. What was she doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this trip, purely a sight-seeing one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she was blind? She was absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone also, as he found by delicate ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions which attained their object; yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was well dressed, and evidently a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl of high intelligence and strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">character--and he was undeniably</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More than once he found the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the man in the blue derby fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">now on the girl, now on himself, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an oddly irritating fashion. Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected that the man was doubtless</seg><seg type="columnLine">a policeman or detective on vacation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was not above seeking prey in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape of an unprotected girl. For he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not think it hard to see that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl was blind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two hours' trip sped by rapidly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and long before Avalon Bay. opened out</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had quietly determined to see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was cared for, unless friends were</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the boat to meet her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You explain everything so clearly,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was a hint of sadness in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone when he had told her of the wharf</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead and the boys swimming about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship and diving for coins. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you don't seem to weary of it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you're an admirable listener,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he smiled. "How is it that you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked away, and, reproaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself instantly for a brute, with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fear that he would be misunderstood</seg><seg type="columnLine">by her evidently sensitive nature, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung to the subject of the boys around</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The chatter and calls which</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated up from the youngsters were</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusing in the extreme, and speedily</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew a rain of small change from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aw, come on, sport! Don't be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piker! Loosen up, old man!" shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">an urchin at Quentin, who laughed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed out a quarter. There was a rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">after it, a storm of spray, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinning youngster came up with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coin in his cheek and a yell for more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come it again!

He looked down at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's face, and.saw it quivering with</seg><seg type="columnLine">delight; it was as if she actually felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the color of everything, and the hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rested on his arm was trembling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Would--would it be imposing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">you"--she half turned to him--"if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked you to take me to the Metropole?</seg><seg type="columnLine">After that I'll be all right, for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends did not expect me, you see-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a pleasure," he reassured her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiring her nerve in making this trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">by herself.

Surely there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing about Hall Burlington to</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspire those last bitter words of hers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear girl," he said finally, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am merely an acquaintance of--of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle. If you are in any trouble, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may tell me in professional confidence."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Even if I said that I hoped never</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enter his door again?" she shot out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with swift and passionate intentness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Jove!" whistled Quentin to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. "This is getting in deep!" Aloud,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reassured her briefly: "I make no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reservation, Miss Elsmere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will trust you, then, if you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that I am taken to Mr. J.

Will you ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where such a promise is necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is seldom safe to trust," he responded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"None the less, I promise, and I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be very glad to help you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her hand fluttered to his arm in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief, then fell to her lap again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I will tell you," she said, sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply as a child. "Three years ago I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was left in care of Doctor Burlington.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He is not really my uncle, though I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have always called him so; I think he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a college mate of my father's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I was orphaned, it was arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Doctor Burlington should have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of my income, and should bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">me up as his own daughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This went well for the first year, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">after that conditions grew insupport-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, Doctor Quentin.

Even Dolly seems to think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father is acting for the best--oh, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is terrible!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She paused, her voice breaking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin was biting his lips in helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewilderment at this strange story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth of which seemed patent in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and voice; his doubts had vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly, and as he thought of Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton in this new light, the thing began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to assume probability.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Mathews," she went on, "are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only .people who take any interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in me, for they were friends of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's also. ^ Doctor Burlington has</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured them that my sight cannot be</seg><seg type="columnLine">restored, but I intend to make a fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it--Mr. Mathews will help me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he understands everything, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's a very fine lawyer. But you are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a doctor--do you think-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not know, Miss Elsmere," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied Quentin very gravely.

He found</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand trembling, and shook himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">together; recalling Burlington's sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth and consequent rise in the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began to believe her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't tell you anything without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a careful examination," he went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly.

When I slipped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the house this morning, I met</seg><seg type="columnLine">some man in the street who steered</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to the electric station, and helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">me on a San Pedro car. The rest was</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy. But Mr. Mathews will take care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me, and I do wish you would look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my eyes! I feel that I can trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She broke off, and he patted her hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly, soothingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Later, Miss Elsmere, I promise you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I will do so. For the present the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main thing is to get into touch with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliese Mathews people, and I'll soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">see about that. I am to mee4: a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of friends at the Country Club this</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon, so as it's barely noon now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll find out where the Mathews people</seg><seg type="columnLine">are.

Wait here a moment."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He walked over to the desk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smilingly waved back the pen shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him by the desk clerk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I'll only be here for lunch, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we don't care to register.

If you walk, the path's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty steep, but you can go up by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incline railway just as well. It's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only residence up there, and Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mathews only built last winter, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving up his legal work in the city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anything I can do for you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, thank you.

He saw the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">fling a quick look in his direction, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was improbable in the extreme that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were speaking of him, so he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to his charge. It was agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, as she was tired, he would leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">her at the hotel after lunch while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought Mathews down to take care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, since he could meet his friends at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the club any time that afternoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, without forebodings, he passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in to a very happy luncheon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After lunching, Quentin obtained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">room-for his charge, and left her at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elevator, in charge of a maid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, getting a telephone booth, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">called up the club, found that both</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy Wells and Bunt Green were</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the links, and left word that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would arrive about five. Whereupon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the afternoon before him, he left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel and walked down Crescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avenue with no more worry upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind than Enid Elsmere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She, however, provided worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. When he had passed the pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic gardens and the Greek theater, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had swung aboard the little railway car</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would lift him to the park above,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had almost reached the conclusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her incredible story was a lie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had known Dolly Burlington for</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, but the intimacy between them</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been only a firm friendship. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed impossible that he should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have known--hold on! Had not Dolly</seg><seg type="columnLine">written him while he was in his senior</seg><seg type="columnLine">year at Stanford that her father had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been appointed ward of an invalid girl?</seg><seg type="columnLine">If she had, the memory was hazy, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">once it had lodged the thought could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be shaken off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had spent a year in Europe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly in study, partly in care of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealthy paralytic, and it was possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these changes had come about in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his absence. In the two years since</seg><seg type="columnLine">his return he had been fairly busy es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tablishing himself in Los Angeles, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had little time to spend with the Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingtons at Long Beach, and Dolly had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been too much occupied with her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">love affair to do other than accept a</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation to which she must have be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come accustomed--providing Enid Els-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere's story was true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon that the car had stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin, who had never visited the Cat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alinas before, in common with most</seg><seg type="columnLine">people who lived close by, obtained his</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction from the conductor and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way along the edge of the Buena</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vista grounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he came upon the place he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought--a snug home built in Swiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">chalet style on the mountainside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">having a gpodly private garden, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it was set so near the park</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds that it seemed almost a part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. Observing that a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda opening off the hillside had</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much the appearance of a front</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance to the house as the stone steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">which led up from a lower level of</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk, Quentin chose the former route,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked the length of the veranda, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang at the side door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His ring brought no response, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pressed the bell again and again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At length he was just turning in dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gust when there came a shuffling step,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door was opened, and a wizened</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man looked at him curiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd like to see Mr. Mathews," an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered Quentin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not to hum, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mrs. Mathews, then," he said, won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering if there were a Mrs. Mathews.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir. They ain't nobody to hum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'cepting me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, where are they, then? I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to see Mr. Mathews or one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">family as soon as possible." Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt an absurd impulse to laugh at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little old man, who was plainly im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed with the importance of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">left in charge of the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm right sorry, sir," and the care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taker scratched his head, "but I ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure when they'll be back. Both on 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Discord in Avalon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">went in on the eight-o'clock boat this</seg><seg type="columnLine">momin', and if they stay over in Los</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angeles for a show to-night they ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">liable to git hum right sudden. May</seg><seg type="columnLine">be back to-night, mebbe to-morrow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sorry, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since there was no help for it, Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin beat a retreat in no little consterna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. This unexpected turn of affairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">left him somewhat up a tree, he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected. As planned, the fishing ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedition was to leave Avalon that night</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a point thirty miles down the coast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where three days would be spent fish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He decided that he would go up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the club later in the afternoon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrange to meet the other two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they came down to embark, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust to luck that Mathews would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If he isn't," he thought, "I'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to chuck the fishing trip, that's all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I guess I'd better do it anyhow;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd sooner spend a few hours with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind girl than with a couple of boozing</seg><seg type="columnLine">millionaires, even with the fishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reaching the Metropole again, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went direct to the girl's room, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maid admitted him. He reported the</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue of his mission briefly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," he concluded, in his cheeriest</seg><seg type="columnLine">professional tone, "would you like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest this afternoon? Or would a trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the submarine gardens interest you ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, by all means!" Her suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager face fell. "But I must not de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain you, Doctor Quentin. It's been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">very good of you to-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nonsense!" he laughed. "My dear</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Elsmere, I have positively nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on hand more than a run up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Country Club later in the afternoon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we'll be back before three, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tourists must catch the last boat back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Pedro. So come along, if you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure you don't need rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rest!" she cried, a passion of long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in her voice. "Anything rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than this uncertainty! It seems as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">though I'd done nothing but just rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">for years and years, and if you'll tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me about the gardens I'll be perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That settled it to Quentin's entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction. Ten minutes later they</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down, but as they crossed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lobby to the street stairs, Quentin saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the figure of Osgood leaning against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desk once more. Reflecting that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the detective was no doubt waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon boat home, he dismissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter altogether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Together with a crowd of sight-seers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they piled into one of the sunk-bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomed launches, and were soon on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Quentin found that his task was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a light one, since the spieler called out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his megaphone what the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects were beneath the glass cockpit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the surgeon had only to amplify</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was said. They passed Sugar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loaf and Moonstone Beach, and Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin realized, to his own surprise, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intent eagerness of the girl beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was drawing him on into a color</seg><seg type="columnLine">phrasing of words that he had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">known he possessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She impressed him strangely, as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat with her sightless eyes fixed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass square beneath them. The cramp</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his own neck as he leaned over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railing was becoming pronounced; why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, did she assume the same position</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was of no value to her? With</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, however, he remembered the sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitiveness of the blind, and wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer; she merely wished to attract</seg><seg type="columnLine">no attention or comment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He considerately kept his voice low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered as he leaned beside her, and while</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few of the other passengers undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly took them for a honeymoon couple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin's hard gray eye cured them</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly of any knowing smiles that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have lingered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are the abalone shells like?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked, as a diver went over the bow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Concave shells, iridescent and glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering. They are beautiful enough be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the water, but lose most of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">color. Here, I'll take two of those!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he added, raising his voice as the diver</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up, dripping, almost beside him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with four or five shells for sale among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tourists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her childlike glee over the wet shells,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the way she clapped one to either</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear touched him strangely. She had all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frank gayety of a child, yet she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him that she was twenty-one; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he looked at her and saw what</seg><seg type="columnLine">little impress her affliction had upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, Quentin began to feel a slow anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising against Doctor Hall Burlington.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly, while she kept the shells over</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ears, entranced, he became aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two men talking at his side, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first words gripped him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yep--blind as a bat if any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">catches her. Slick dodge, ain't it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">They say she's the slickest dip ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept out o' court, too. She's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">workin' the Catalina boats off and on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I expect they've put the cops after</seg><seg type="columnLine">her too late, as usual. She's prob'ly</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat it--by jolly, ain't that pretty now?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The speaker leaned over, silent for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment as the boat passed over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vale of feathery, swaying blue sea vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets, interwoven with feather-boa kelp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shells and the flicker of darting fish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Quentin sat motionless, his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a whirl, until the second man took</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the thread of conversation.

What</seg><seg type="columnLine">had that conversation meant? There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one way to find out, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had reached the hotel again he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it. Promising to return for din-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, he left Enid at her room and vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ited the desk clerk, bluntly asking him</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it was a fact that a woman pickpocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">was "working" the boats, and if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">played blindness when detected.

Quentin rdse from his chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the wildly swinging arm, saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottle, and then very determinedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung Green down into his chair, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lay gasping for air.

It seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cold certainty that she was not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pickpocket in question, but that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had neatly "touched" him for most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his money. He had ten or twelve dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars left, but no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By George, though, I can't believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">it!" he cogitated, walking slowly along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yet the thing fits together so dam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nably ! Her hand was at my coat pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I first noticed her, and if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been stalling to remove my sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picion she couldn't have done it better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than she did. Then she caught at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name I gave Osgood--and it sure took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of work to get the stkry out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her! She either made it up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot, which seems most likely, all things</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered, or else she was telling God's</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth. I'm blest if I know what to</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that, he sat down on a bench</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think it over. Glancing at his watch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Discord in Avalon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he found that he had half an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the last boat left *for the main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. Unless he was to catch it, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must stay overnight, and twelve dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars would hardly stand the strain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two rooms at the Metropole. Yet, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">his doubts were correct, she would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for his return--and then there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mathews affair, which might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a lie also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Lord !" he groaned, dropping his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and staring at the ground. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of a balled-up ruddy mess have</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stumbled into? If I convict her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own mind, and skip out for home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my conscience will prick forever after.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If that impossible tale of hers is true,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she needs help mighty badly.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">half an hour he could return to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel, and if the girl had slipped away</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would simply take her room till the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, for he had enough money left</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cover it. If she was still there it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a fairly sure indication that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his suspicions were unjust,, for she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hardly remain to meet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mathews unless she was sure of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. In which case, Mathews could</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot the bills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin shook his head hopelessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he remembered that his only means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of identifying himself should need arise</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay in that missing bill fold that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained his cards, money, and letters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, he had nothing worse in pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect than an overnight stay on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll do it," he said, rising at last.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll let the gods decide. If she's at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel, I'll give her eyes a test or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two and abide by the result.

He looked after the man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was going on up the avenue, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then thoughtfully continued his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last steamer of the day had gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was with no little suspense that</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he requested the desk clerk to call up</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Elsmere's room with his name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go right up, doctor," came the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer, and Quentin walked to the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vator with a song in his heart. The die</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cast--a simple test or two, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would doubt no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She greeted him with outstretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, her maid remaining in the al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covelike bedroom, and the frank de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light in her face was so wholly unas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed that Quentin's heart smote him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He found that she was tired, and pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred talking quietly to going' forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the island again, and she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuinely glad to hear that his fishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip had been "unavoidably" called off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that he could remain with her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, dismissing the maid, he took her</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the palm-shaded corner in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lobby, where they sank into the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs and talked. He not only made</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or two^simple tests, such as pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his finger close before her eyes, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he also told her of the loss of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocketbook and frankly asked if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had any money. Her childish ripple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter disarmed his last suspicions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she smilingly replied that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten dollars, which satisfied Quentin that</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the night at least they would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to pull through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While they talked, during the hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">that remained before dinner time, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him more of her story and of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">life under the roof of Doctor Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton. The fact that she was of age</seg><seg type="columnLine">mattered nothing, for as a dependent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the physician had been given the cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tody of her person and the use of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">income; while an appeal to the courts</seg><seg type="columnLine">would of course result in her release,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been kept in rather gilded seclu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, Burlington evidently knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of the clear, incisive brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">which lay behind her broad brows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder now that I had the cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age--or rather, that I never had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage to slip away before," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally. "It is so good of you to help</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me--and I am so sorry that I must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a burden upon you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind that," returned Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothingly. "We'll take a stroll to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mathews' cottage to-night, and if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't come back I'll leave a note tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of your presence here. Unless they</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to-night or in the morning, we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">apt to have trouble, I fancy. Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton will trace you here easily enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the men who helped you at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long Beach and San Pedro--but don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry," he added quickly, as her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowed over, "I've three days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom; I'll wire my housekeeper for</seg><seg type="columnLine">money to-night, and we'll soon tumble</seg><seg type="columnLine">your worthy uncle off his high horse."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, having quite restored her cheer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful optimism, he tucked her hand under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm, and they went in to dinner</seg><seg type="columnLine">together--for dinner clothes have little</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in Avalon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what will you have to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">with?" he smiled, picking up the carte.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anything plebeian and understanda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble," she retorted. "You order, please."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly," he answered, mentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanking himself that he had learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trick of ordering for a fair com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion. Dolly had been wont to assure</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that a woman could not help ador-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a man who could order fittingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">without questioning her--and he smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself at the thought. He was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to wish that Enid Elsmere</seg><seg type="columnLine">could take a lesson or two in adoration</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Dolly Burlington.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">\ Having ordered, he laid aside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">c$rd--and looked up to see Bert Os-</seg><seg type="columnLine">good calmly sitting three tables away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently paying them no attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever. But it suddenly occurred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin that if this blind girl were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reality afraid of justice, she could find</seg><seg type="columnLine">no better refuge than the Hotel Metro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole, sheltered as the patient of a sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geon of some little repute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a little shock, he crushed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought down sternly, and a song rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more in his heart at the smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Discord in Avalon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the girl-woman who sat across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table and gazed at him with eyes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More than once it seemed to Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the girl was on the point of making</seg><seg type="columnLine">some confidence--hinted at by the fleet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing expression of her face, not by any</seg><seg type="columnLine">words; more than once he saw her</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance in the direction of the detective's</seg><seg type="columnLine">table as though she sensed the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some disturbing factor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I hope we'll find Mathews there to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night," he said finally, when dinner was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all but finished. "Burlington will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">over by the morning if he's traced you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swift alarm shot into her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Then--if I dared-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" he smiled, as she paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly. "Is there anything you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">not told me, Miss Elsmere?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes---'I--no," and the struggle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face was gone. "No, doctor; I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">must play out the game-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What do you mean?" He leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, wondering what lay behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">those words. "You can trust me ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely, Miss Elsmere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it is not that, indeed! But my</seg><seg type="columnLine">--my uncle must not see me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He shall not, believe me," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin settled back in his chair. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, her agitation at Burlington's name</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite natural, he told himself; yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">--what if Burlington should prove to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in the right? If the girl had a brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumor, it was possible that her sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be restored, but as he watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">those violet eyes Quentin found it hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to believe that Enid Elsmere was either</seg><seg type="columnLine">so afflicted or was even blind. At times</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fixed, vacant expression was lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her face, and in those moments the</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet eyes seemed to be scanning him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading his very thoughts. It was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canny, and to quiet his doubts he rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must send a telegram and get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">room here, so if you'll wait I'll be back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in a moment, and we can start out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mathews place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded smilingly, and Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">departed to the lobby. Here he regis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, got a room not far from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Enid, and sent a wire to his house-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper, instructing her to wire him</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty dollars that night without fail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So, with his immediate future provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, he returned to the dining room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in ten minutes left the hotel with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Enid on his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he helped her into the car at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incline, he forgot that conversation on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass-bottomed launch, the loss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocketbook, and his fleeting doubts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She settled near him with a shivery</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear as the car began to lift.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, it seems like--like some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me was missing!" she gasped.

It swiftly occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him that such a thought should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been terribly jarring on the sensitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves of a blind girl--or so at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have supposed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound it!" he exclaimed men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tally. "Here I am doubting again!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He resolutely cast all doubts from him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and answered her question with a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fident pressure on her arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're different, Miss Elsmere, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm glad of it.

She turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face to him eagerly, and Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that her eyes were wide set, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she were looking through and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond him.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is entirely to my own interest to do so."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could not help wondering at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmness, and he admired her the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it. At the edge of the park they</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused '"while he stood looking down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the moonlit view beneath, and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed. it to her.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">responded to his words as if she felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the utter beauty of the scene, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught at his arm suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen! There is music!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned, and caught the first notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the band concert floating up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Greek theater in the valley below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was "La Paloma" they played, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin suddenly decided that the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not so hackneyed, after all; indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this girl on his arm seemed to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a little like a helpless dove--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to curb the sentimental influence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night and the thought, he led her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a seat close by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Physician's orders--moonlight and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">music," he laughed. "Ten to one the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mathews people will be doing likewise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they've come home.

The moonlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">softened her face remarkably, deepen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing its shadows until he could see only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strong curves of brow and nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly speaking, they sat for a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">half hour while the moon 'rose higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lost its warm, early glow.

He stiffened sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, then spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why are the initials 'M.

They are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She started, but turned a perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm face to his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--the bracelet was given me by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a friend, Mary Palmer, three years ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She set her own initials in it so that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I would not forget her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite the quiet words, Quentin had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a helpless feeling that the explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lame. But he savagely forced down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought, though he stored away that</seg><seg type="columnLine">name in his mind, and without com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment led her along toward the Mathews</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they drew closer to it, he saw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no little dismay, that the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dark and seemingly empty. Turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in at the gate, he led Enid up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path, though he found that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderfully apt at evading trees and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes even without his warnings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When they reached the side entrance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin pushed at the bell in vain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he could distinctly hear the faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Discord in Avalon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">17</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">answering ring. There was no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it; the Mathews had not returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor was the caretaker in evidence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin usually carried a small pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric flash lamp, and after seating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl in one of the porch chairs he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out and flashed it swiftly over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. No, all was closed and screened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sight of the girl's silent despair</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he told her the result caused him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do some swift thinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The failure of Mathews to return</seg><seg type="columnLine">home was annoying in the extreme, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cogitated, and it might easily prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more. Burlington was not apt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have great difficulty in tracing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, and he could either take the regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar morning boat to the islands or else</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would get a launch from Long Beach</seg><seg type="columnLine">and come over. In that case, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment would count.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can bluff Burlington or lead him</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the trail," he reflected, "but I'd bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter leave a note here telling Mathews</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get down to the hotel on the jump.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He might gain time by coming over</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one of the Long Beach boats, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's coming from Los Angeles. I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll do that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, taking the girl's hand in his, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed the flash lamp in her palm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set her finger on the button.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you'll hold that just so, I'll write</seg><seg type="columnLine">a note to your friend and leave it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can get back to the hotel," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and since it was necessary for her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold the light steady he was slow in</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosing her hand--quite unaccountably</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. In fact, the contact thrilled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">very pleasantly. Then, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that he was taking advantage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her implicit trust, he stepped away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and explored his pockets for paper and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pencil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finding an old prescription blank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he scribbled a hasty note, merely tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Mathews that his presence was</seg><seg type="columnLine">urgently needed at the hotel by Miss x</seg><seg type="columnLine">Enid Elsmere ana asking him to lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a moment in getting there. Sign-</seg><seg type="columnLine">2</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the paper, he read over the note</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the girl for her approval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will do nicely," she said with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a decisive nod. "Where will you put</seg><seg type="columnLine">it ? Is there a mail box ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing doing in that line," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled. "The mail box is back at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front gate. I'll open the door, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">else slip it under."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking the light from her, he flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over the door again, but found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer screen door fastened. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening was tight, he drew out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocketknife and without trouble in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted the blade so that the catch raised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he swung the screen back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If my friend Osgood could see me</seg><seg type="columnLine">now," he chuckled inwardly, "he'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">apt to run me in on general principles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I guess!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he expected, he found the inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">door locked. So he stooped over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped the note inside, and rose with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feeling of relief. After all, Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton might not be over in the morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mathews would be easily able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle the legal difficulties of the girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation. In any case, he himself had</seg><seg type="columnLine">three days to spare, and he could re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main and take care of Enid, if neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I feel unaccountably like a thief,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he laughed under his breath, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed the light across the door again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closed the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It does feel silent and deserted."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She shivered a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put away his flash lamp and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just turning to take her arm when an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other stream Of light shot full into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, blinding him.

Slight as the thing was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it steadied him and buoyed him up won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the same time it served to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind him that she was utterly depend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent on him. The whole miserable</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle resolved itself in his mind; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew only that this girl's entire future</seg><seg type="columnLine">depended on him and on his extricat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them both from the toils cast about</seg><seg type="columnLine">them by the detective.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he gazed at the man, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fishing in his pocket for something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">jangled, while at the same time keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">his automatic carefully in place, Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin sensed the wild anger that was surg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up in him. It was so unreasonable</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that this brute should hold Enid Els-*</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere's future in his thick hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">never know it! The self-assurance, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">confident power of the detective's whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner flecked Quentin on tin raw; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of being handcuffed was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much altogether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're not going to handcuff me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my man," he asserted flatly.

"I've had enough jaw out o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, bo. You'll march down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel, and if she's still keeping up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind game she can have you for guide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">see? Now stick out your mitts, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">two--your right to his left, girly!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He chuckled at his own jest as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangled up the handcuffs. Until that</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant Quentin had not realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osgood meant to iron the girl. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a little frightened gasp break</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her lips, and the hand went from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder. For a second he gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the detective, incredulous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Osgood read his startled unbelief for</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, and grinned. But a flame of rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">had swelled up in Quentin's brain as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he comprehended the detective's intent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iron this helpless girl! A mad fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled on him--but it did not destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">his caution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lowered his left hand, half turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as if to bring down the hand of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Enid with his right. At all costs he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must prevent this outrage, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater danger to her that lay behind it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt. So, as Osgood lowered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic and reached out with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open handcuffs, Quentin swiftly struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with his open left hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked the weapon a dozen feet away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Osgood was taken completely by sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise. He ripped out one savage oath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Quemfci's fist drove into his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sent him staggering back. Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin followed him with a leap, in des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate fear lest he draw another re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver, but before the detective could</seg><seg type="columnLine">recover himself he had landed a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow to the mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He missed the chin, but Osgood was</seg><seg type="columnLine">goaded into rage, and rushed at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a shout of fury. Instead of avoid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the rush, Quentin stepped into it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">took a glancing blow on the cheek, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought up his right from the waist</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all his force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There seemed little power in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow, so swift was it; but the detec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive's arms flew out, his head rocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, and, with a single groan, he fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a crumpled heap over Quentin's feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a clean knock-out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin's mind worked fast in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant. A glint from the gravel path</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught his eye, and he stooped quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to grasp the handcuffs. He knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must get this fellow out of the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silenced, at least until a few hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed. How he was to manage it</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not quite see, but with the irons</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him Osgood would at least be be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond making any more mischief for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the present. He well knew that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole affair would mean future trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">for himself, but he would manage to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out of it somehow, and the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing now was to put Osgood where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be safe for a time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So without hesitation he brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's wrists together and snapped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the handcuffs. Then he straightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">up--and saw Enid Elsmere standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">just beside him, the automatic held in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment he stood paralyzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with astonishment. He had knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weapon into the bushes, he remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered ; if she was blind, how had she</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured it? Was she blind, after all?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where--where did you get that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun ?" he panted hoarsely. "How could</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know where it-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I heard something fall," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply. "I found it--oh, what has hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened ? Why don't you tell me what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've done? I can't see! I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her wail of despair smote him, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she dropped the weapon with a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry, he caught her and held her for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, thrilled out of himself by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clinging softness of her arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all right, Enid," he exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Discord in Avalon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. "That was a detective who</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to arrest us.

Too late--the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had feared most of all had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened ! Quentin leaned over and picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the automatic, quietly shoving it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his coat pocket as he faced the amazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">caretaker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The caretaker's face was a battle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground for fear and curiosity and sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picion, with the odds about even.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin drew a little breath of relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he saw recognition join in the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flict, and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any word from Mr. Mathews yet?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not yet, sir.

The whole</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scheme had come to him now; it would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hold things off until the morning, at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">least; and, while it would eventually</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cause a worse muddle than ever, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">promised to save Enid Elsmere--which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was the main thing just at present.</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly going through the detective's</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes, Quentin found a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheap printed cards and letters, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he transferred to his own pockets. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">money in the man's pockets he left</seg><seg type="columnLine">untouched, but unpinned the star from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his vest and fastened it inside his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Satisfied at length that Osgood had</seg><seg type="columnLine">110 means of identification left, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to rise; on second thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely emptied the man's pockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of money and all else, determining to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a thorough job of it. Osgood</seg><seg type="columnLine">was breathing heavily, and Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose at length to find the old caretaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">.shuffling excitedly from the open front</seg><seg type="columnLine">door with a cup of water in his hand..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right; thanks," he said, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knelt beside Enid.

A little locket of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold fell out into his hand; as he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed it, he noted instinctively that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore the letter "M" inset with bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liants.

He stepped down to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">the caretaker returning, and exchanged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the folded paper for the rope the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man bore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Discord in Avalon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give this note to Mr. Mathews the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he returns.

He suspects that you are a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pickpocket who is known to play at</seg><seg type="columnLine">being blind if detected.

All that I ask of you is to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me the truth. If your' story was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">true one, I apologize, for I really want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to aid you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw the swift struggle that shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her face, and as her eyes rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his, it seemed that they must in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed be looking at him, for that fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">stare had vanished abruptly. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the torture evident in her fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, despite its reflection on his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, he said what he had meant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her hands twisted in her lap, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">against all reason Quentin felt a mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse to cover them with his own.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then she calmed herself with a quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort, her face pale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can only say that when we see Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mathews you will be forced to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, Doctor Ouentin," she said quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am sorry for all this dreadful affair</seg><seg type="columnLine">that has come upon you; I do not want</seg><seg type="columnLine">you drawn into my troubles-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say no more, please!" he cried, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little laugh, rising.

Then Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to the office, obtained a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">envelope, and sealed up the money and</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers he had taken from the detective,</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing the other's name across the flap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kindly take care of this," he said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night clerk.

Ten minutes later he sought his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own room, supplied with money, a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">undesirable alias, and a police star</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose magnitude appalled him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This bit of nickel is going to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">me into a bad fuss," he thought-, gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the thing.

If it</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't, I know a rising young surgeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">who is going to be in dutch! But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">only wish Enid hadn't slipped me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary Palmer yarn. That gets my</seg><seg type="columnLine">goat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Think it over as he would, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive at no conclusion. Finally he</seg><seg type="columnLine">phoned a call for eight in the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went to bed, wondering if the aw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful muddle would leave him any chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sleep. But, contrary to his own ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectations, the memory of Bert Osgood</seg><seg type="columnLine">trussed up in his shed merged into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lap of the waves under the hotel win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows, and Allan Quentin ended his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">day in Avalon in greater peace than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At eight-twenty Quentin was drink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the fresh air of the new morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the wharf, as Enid had promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to breakfast with him at nine. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation seemed not nearly so bad as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had appeared the night before;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mathews would be over in the morning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">boat to relieve him of his charge, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed less probable that Burlington</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be able to track Enid by the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two men who had helped her at Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, her manner worried him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a good deal that lacked ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation, and Quentin began to fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her blindness was in reality due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brain tumor; after all, she had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">put him off when he had set the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">frankly before her last night. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that forced him to believe in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">was her appeal to Mathews, for by</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet inquiries Quentin had found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man was a retired lawyer of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominence and of high repute. Yet it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a bitter job to quell his forebod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings and compel himself to belief; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest aid in this was the remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brance of the girl's face. It haunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and filled him with strange long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings--what a pity she had this afflic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, he thought!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He roused himself at sight of a trim</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch cutting in around the headland,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caught, the words "Long Beach</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat" from a group of boatman loung-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing near by. As he made out the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures sitting in the launch, Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">started; it seemed as though a cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand had gripped suddenly at his heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well he knew that erect, precise figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had as usual retained its frock</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat and silk hat, even on a launch</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the boat drew in to the wharf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin's sudden fear passed into ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilaration. He noted the rather flaccid</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, the quick-darting blue eyes, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">massive jaw under the crisp gray mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tache, and laughed. Since Doctor Hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington had come, Enid must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him the true story, after all! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot all else in that swift thought--</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to the bound detective who lay in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shed behind the Mathews' cottage;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and realizing that he must get Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton off the track, he stepped foAvard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet the launch as it drifted in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Discord in Avalon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Burlington!" he called easily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Got a hurry call?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burlington's quick blue eye picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out, and the other waved a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">in reply. The launch drew up, Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton seized Quentin's hand and mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wharf, then tossed a gold piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the boatman in payment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Morning, Quentin--you're just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man I want to see," and he took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger man's arm. "Come along--</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you on vacation?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Partly," responded Quentin, falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">into step. He noted that Burlington's</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner was not wholly free of agita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. "What's up--an operation?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No/' and the other glanced around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then halted. "Are you free to help me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit, Quentin? Professional confi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence, understand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin met his eve and laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess so, Burlington.

Gazing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, Quentin felt sudden dislike of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man; to him Burlington had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed rather formal and precise, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">now it was as though a mask had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped away. Quentin 110 longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted every word of Enid's story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his mind raced desperately. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that at all costs he must keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington from seeing that hotel reg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ister, and he suddenly resolved on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bold course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you come over yesterday?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blue eyes shot into his suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--I brought over a girl from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Los Angeles.

"My pa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tient is a young woman, and blind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What's the matter, Burlington?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Her name!" The other gripped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, his face flaming a dull red.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's her name, Quentin?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why--Miss Palmer," lied Quentin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the name flashed into his mind. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">older man's hand fell away, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">mopped at his face again with a sigh of</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I beg your pardon, Quentin--I'm a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little overwrought, I fancy." At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause Quentin chuckled inwardly; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bold ruse had worked, and it was evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent that the other man held no sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picions. Burlington hesitated, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed harshly, taking Quentin's arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm in rather a hard position, Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin.

He was getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">back his usual precise air by this time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes?" encouraged Quentin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I say, she is addicted to melan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cholia and odd conceptions--imagines</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she's an abused heiress and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. Nothing dangerous, but a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting case, no doubt due to a brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumor. I'm hoping that an operation</seg><seg type="columnLine">will fix her up first rate. But yester-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day morning she got away--we had her</seg><seg type="columnLine">under observation, you understand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From various persons I found that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had got to a San Pedro car and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been inquiring about the islands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there seems to be no doubt that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">came over here yesterday."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, that's easily fixed," suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin craftily. "A word to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stable here and he'll be able-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no!" Burlington cried sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, halting him again with evident haste.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She is very sensitive, and anything in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nature of a scene might throw her</seg><seg type="columnLine">into hysteria, Quentin. It's a matter for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to handle personally, and if you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">give me your help I'll be very glad in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly, I'll do whatever I can,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and Quentin's cold gray eyes and reso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lute face gave no hint of the double</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning in his words. ''How's Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington and Dolly? Have you had</seg><seg type="columnLine">any breakfast?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--they're all right," came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">confused answer. Quentin had a hazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of getting Burlington off to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the smaller hotels for breakfast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'd better take a day off and run</seg><seg type="columnLine">out before long, old man; you look</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather run down. By the way, I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had better go up to the Metropole</seg><seg type="columnLine">and start inquiries there, and I'll get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bite to eat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin's heart leaped. This was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very thing he had feared. If he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">only keep Burlington away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Metropole register, he might be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste time until the morning boat came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. And if Mathews did not come then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would simply have to make an open</seg><seg type="columnLine">break with Burlington and take Enid</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his own protection--though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a very hazy idea of the law in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases. However, the main thing was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the two apart for a time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was the girl's name?" he tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porized, wondering how to manage</seg><seg type="columnLine">things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Elsmere--Enid Elsmere," came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, and his last doubts of the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">fled away. "Still, she might not use her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own name, Quentin. The easiest way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to track her will be by her blindness."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, look here," dnd Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted in desperation. "I'll run up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Metropole and arrange to get away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and also make inquiries. You cover the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stamford and Hermosa, and I'll meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">you at the latter place for breakfast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How's that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burlington drew a hand across his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy lips and nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Quentin. Hadn't you bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter have a description of the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It might help," smiled Quentin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking that he needed little description</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the person in question. He glanced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at his watch and found that he still</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fifteen minutes to spare. "There'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be 110 trouble in locating her, though."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hope not," grunted Burlington, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes darting around them until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin felt some uneasiness lest Enid</seg><seg type="columnLine">come forth for a morning stroll. "How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, I know exactly the clothes she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore when she got away. She's a rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">small young woman, about twenty-two</seg><seg type="columnLine">in appearance, though in reality she's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so old; black-haired and gray-eyed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing a deep red dress of some soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff, with a dark-gray wrap."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh?" Quentin suddenly felt as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though his entire structure had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">riven asunder. "Just go over that</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, if you don't mind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other repeated his description,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Quentin was only sparring for</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, trying to keep his amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealed. Those few words had stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered him, swept him out of his depth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good heavens!" he thought, grop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing after some fragment of sanity in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wild mix-up. "Enid is violet-eyed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown-haired, and has a white dress--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she's pretty near as tall as I am!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Am I crazy, or is Burlington ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing but the most pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cise earnestness in the other man's man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, however. He would have no reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give a false description of the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected Quentin; but this thought led</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into a new maze of probabilities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was unlikely in the extreme that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be more than one blind girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the lot, for that would be stretch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing coincidence too far. Yet the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tective had been after a blind girl, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own charge was blind--or said she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind, and here Burlington was after</seg><seg type="columnLine">another one!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So far, the only one of the three who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had materialized was his own girl. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">-had claimed to be Enid Elsmere; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">was she? She did not answer Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's description, and Quentin felt a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift and horrible doubt of her. Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">she the woman pickpocket, after all?</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Discord in Avalon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Had she deliberately builded on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of Enid Elsmere, with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the state of things in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington's household on which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">base her structure of lies?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only other possibility was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington had given him a false de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scription, and this seemed utterly im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable, out of the question. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no reason for it, and Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up with helpless struggle in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead to the other two places,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington. I'll meet you and we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">either breakfast at the Hermosa--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back to the Metropole."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other strode off with a curt nod.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin's last words had been born of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a desperate idea, a frantic effort to cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">this whole weird Gordian knot at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow. If Burlington had given him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">true description of his ward, then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl at the Metropole was posing under</seg><seg type="columnLine">an assumed name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that case, a meeting between them</seg><seg type="columnLine">would only serve to show her that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin had pierced through her de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception, and it would undoubtedly pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voke a straightforward explanation be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other hand, if Burlington had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lied in his description and she was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">real Enid Elsmere, the thing would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to a show-down then and there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington would be taken in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">net, and if he attempted to claim the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, Quentin decided that he himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">could then step in with some semblance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just the same," he thought, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped up the hotel steps, "I'll stick by</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. If she's a pickpocket, I'll be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole lot mistaken; but whatever she</seg><seg type="columnLine">is or does, I'll give her one more chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come across with the truth.. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">George, I can't believe that she has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been deliberately acting a part all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Prompted by a sudden thought that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he might find two Enid Elsmeres regis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, he strode over to the desk only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have the hope destroyed. Also, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day clerk made a reference to the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velope waiting for Osgood which</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that he was inclined to be sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picious, and Quentin hastily assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that the detective would call for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it that day. He turned to the elevator,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering miserably how he was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get out of the net that he had tan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled around himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At Enid's door he found her waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him, and her quiet poise, her air of</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter confiding trust in him, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook him from the resolution he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken. Yet--at sight of him did a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of alarm flit over her face, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she read the conflict in his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or did she merely sense it subconscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laid this to his imagination, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, when he took her hand and an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered her greeting, trying to keep his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice level. As he led her from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevator across the lobby, toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dining room, he spoke lightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you don't mind, I'll get you seat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, then I'll run over to the Hermosa</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bring back a chap I want you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet, Miss Elsmere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Try as he would, he could not keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice quite firm, and the glance she</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed him only heightened his self-ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cusation. Then she nodded and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly--I'll be glad to meet any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your friends."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We won't call him a friend."</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed Quentin uneasily, beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reproach himself already. "Anyway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you sit down here and I'll be right back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh, yes--I think that I'll introduce you</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Miss Palmer, too. Your absent girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend won't object to that, I trust?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you please, doctor," she replied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seating herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin hurried away, a little chilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by those final words. He found Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lington waiting for him on the steps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hermosa, precise and dignified as</seg><seg type="columnLine">28</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, but with uneasiness resting in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">never-quiet blue eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What luck, Burlington?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None, so far. You did not find her</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Metropole?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, but my patient is waiting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast with us. Come on over, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after breakfast, if nothing has hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, we'll soon locate your patient."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington nodded, his eyes resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Quentin for a second; then with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather patronizing manner which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarly offensive to the younger man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took Quentin's arm, and they walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the other hotel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next five minutes would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out of the labyrinth, thought Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin--in one way or the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the way," asked Quentin, halt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the steps of the hotel and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termining swiftly to see just where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington stood, "from whom did your</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient escape? She was not confined,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I suppose?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other shot him a quick glance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but QUentin's face expressed only in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested curiosity and sympathy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. She was--er--being taken care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of by friends who lived at Long Beach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not thought that she would try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get away, for her mind has never</seg><seg type="columnLine">run to violence or anything of the sort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She merely slipped out alone, got a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the street to help her on the car, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was an end /&gt;f it. Her friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to call in detectives and all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of thing, but I happened to find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had helped her, and that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">all straight. She's over here somewhere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and should be easy to locate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That clinched the matter in Quentin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. He tried, to recall any girl an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swering the description of Enid, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat coming over, but could not. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, he had been too much absorbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his own blind girl to watch other</seg><seg type="columnLine">people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, my friend and professional</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother, you've lied neatly," he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly, as they entered the hotel. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought halted him mentally, however.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had Burlington lied to him, after all?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had doubted Enid's story in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first place, though she had substanti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated it by her seeming knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington's family. If her story had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been true, Burlington had just now'lied</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him; yet Burlington had described</seg><seg type="columnLine">an entirely different girl as the one for</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he was searching, which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather tend to back up his own story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't make head nor tail of it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned Quentin to himself. "I'll sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply introduce 'em, and that will put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole thing on the knees of the gods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I feel blatned sorry for the gods!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pleading that there was no time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste on formalities, he steered Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lington past the desk without register-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, they left their hats at the dining-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room entrance, and he led the way to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the table at which Enid Elsmere</seg><seg type="columnLine">still sat. He reflected that if she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lied to him, it would be poetic justice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he should introduce her by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of Mary Palmer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before they reached the table, Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin had found the answer to his men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal questionings. He saw Burlington's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes fall on the figure of Enid, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicker on without any change to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next table. The girl had not been rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ognized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This settled one doubt, only to raise</seg><seg type="columnLine">another; how could she have known of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blind girl in Burlington's care? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">physician's presence proved that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been such a person, and Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no more doubts that the girl's story</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a true one, whether true as</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded herself or not. However, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment later they hadv reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, and there was no time to reflect</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Palmer, allow me to present</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Hall Burlington--Burlington,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my patient, Miss Palmer."</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Discord in Avalon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burlington bowed in his precise man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, but the girl's face suddenly flamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarlet, then became dead white; Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin could almost have sworn that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sight in the violet eyes that went</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one to the other of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are now breakfasting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">two famous professional men, Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palmer," he went on, forcing a laugh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now that he had found out what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to know, he refused to torture</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl further. If she was a pick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket--well and good; it was still to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be explained how she had known of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bis own intimacy with Dolly Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it is the gentlemen who are hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ored," added Burlington, with heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallantry.

Her manner gave Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin no doubt of her evident shame and</seg><seg type="columnLine">distress, but at thought of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple-minded faith in her story, Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin felt little remorse at his action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> None the less, he steered Burlington</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a line of talk which he could keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">up indefinitely; the Long Beach phy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sician had bought heavily in real estate</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the past year or two, and conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently was a "booster" of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">virulent type. He talked at length until</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast was served, Quentin and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl having only to throw in a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there to keeping him going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another crisis was coming from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">source which Quentin little suspected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however. Before breakfast was half</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, a waiter brought him in a note</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he tore open with a word of</seg><seg type="columnLine">apology to the others. It was a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief and curt request that he visit the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">office. Wondering what was up now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he excused himself, and went out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desk, finding there the clerk with</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom Osgood had been talking on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous day. The clerk nodded at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and led him into the interior office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doctor,'' he said challengingly, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">left a package here for that bull, Os-</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, last night.

You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a mistake, young man, and you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">better back water pretty hard, and do</seg><seg type="columnLine">it quick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clerk tried to stare him down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the result was only to send him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stammering apology, and Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that his bluff had gone down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None the less, he insisted on sending</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Burlington, and when that individ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ual arrived and identified him in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise, Ouentin promptly closed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Merely a matter of cashing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">check," he explained to Burlington as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they returned to their table. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved his hand loftily, sat down with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pompous air which ruffled Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">afresh, adjusted his cuffs, and fell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breakfast. Quentin smiled at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl and was astonished to see a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">color rise in her cheeks--as if she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen the smile and took it for an as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surance. From that moment he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced that she was no other than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pickpocket, and that she was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more blind than he was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The delicate irony of forcing Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton to help him out made him chuckle</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, but he longed for Mathews to</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">show up that the tangle might be com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete. Certainly this girl had been con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fident in her appeal to Mathews, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin wondered if every one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into contact with her was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn into some wild imbroglio. Os-</seg><seg type="columnLine">good had certainly suffered therefor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and just at present Burlington seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be in for future trouble also!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Miss Palmer," he said finally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Doctor Burlington and I are going out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look up a professional case, into</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he has drawn me on consulta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. You won't mind if 1 leave you</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an hour or so?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course not!" She smiled up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a rather pathetic effort at</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightness, he thought. "But you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">take me to my room, first?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By all means!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burlington shook hands w'ith her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his most precise air, and Quentin led</seg><seg type="columnLine">her from the dining room, keeping up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farce. She said nothing until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stepped from the elevator, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin turned her around gently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, Enid Elsmere?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She put out her hand to his arm im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsively.	/</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doctor Quentin, you made a prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ise to Enid Elsmere to help her to es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape from her guardian.

Do you wish to be released</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it or not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ouentin was taken aback by her firm</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, and as he searched her face he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it impossible to believe that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl was a shamed, discomfited thief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was making no plea; she was mere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly asking him a direct question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear girl," he said softly, ltis</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand closing on hers, "please let this</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter drop until I can get back for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk.

"Oh, if he were only here</seg><seg type="columnLine">now I would be able to tell you every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing! Come to me when you get</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with Doctor Burlington--I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain to you then if I can. Please--</seg><seg type="columnLine">please continue to trust me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look up at me, Mary Palmer," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and her head came up; but if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacant, fixed stare in the violet eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">was assumed, he could not tell. "Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the circumstances--if you'll par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don my language--wouldn't any man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who granted that request be nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">short of a damned fool?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She flushed. Then, to his amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, a laugh flickered across her face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes--but I still make it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right--it's granted," he smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerfully, unable to resist the charm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. "I'll be back as soon as I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake Burlington, and get straightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. I don't know whether you're blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not, or whether there are three blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls wandering around Avalon, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether your name is Enid Elsmere or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary Palmer--but I'll bank on you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you can depend on me to the limit."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her face changed--confidence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">regret and perplexity following each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other in swift succession. Quentin saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the violet eyes had lost their fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression, but that might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of the tears that glittered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Oh, I--I wish I could have known</seg><seg type="columnLine">that yesterday!" she faltered. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing him back as she averted her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to hide her tears, she left him</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly and entered her own room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin flung back his .shoulders ag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressively as he returned to the eleva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor. So, then, the whole matter was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last out in the open! She was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pickpocket and no other--yet for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Discord in Avalon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">31</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sake of her indefinable appeal, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake of her smile and the touch of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, he was going to help her elude</seg><seg type="columnLine">justice at the cost of his own good</seg><seg type="columnLine">name and reputation, it might well be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I'll be a damned fool to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limit," he reflected bitterly. "But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't believe her a thief until she has</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me so herself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fate had not yet finished with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however--or rather, he was still serv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as a shuttlecock between fate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nemesis. As he left the elevator, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the desk clerk, Burlington, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">another--a pudgy man in policeman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes--talking quietly together and</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently waiting for him. The clerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to him with puzzled deference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here he is now. Doctor Quentin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is the island constable, Mr. Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bean. I'tn sorry, sir, but you seem in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot water all around to-day!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter now?" smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin, wondering if his fight with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osgood had become noised abroad. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pudgy constable eyed him in hesitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, sir, I didn't know exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to do--you see, a couple of gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlemen at the club yesterday-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, that!" Quentin laughed again</seg><seg type="columnLine">in relief. He remembered that Osgood</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said something about the constable</seg><seg type="columnLine">in connection with the reported assault.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're looking that up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pudgy constable, whose lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties made his office a sinecure, nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir. Doctor Burlington says</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that you're all right, though-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, I am," laughed Quentin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at that he explained exactly how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the affair at the club had come about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stated that it was no doubt a joke</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpetrated by Green.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess that's right, sir," said Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bean, grinning. "I've been talking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people up there, and Mr. Green</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little off color, I'm afraid. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone off fishing, so if Doctor Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton will vouch for you we'd better let</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing hang over. It won't do to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give the island a bad name, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, of course," broke in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington, in evident haste to be off</seg><seg type="columnLine">after his quarry. "I'll answer for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin, my man--any one in Los An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geles knows him. Now come along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin. We can't waste any more</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So for the second time Burlington</seg><seg type="columnLine">had extricated him from a difficulty!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin grinned inwardly as he fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed the other to the steps; he saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good inahy more difficulties ahead, no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tably that of Osgood. But these could</seg><seg type="columnLine">all wait, and now he put himself at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposal of Burlington with a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerful heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They discussed the affair in hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, after a brief talk, decided that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could do nothing except make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvass of the half dozen smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotels. In order to save as much time</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible, they divided these between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and Burlington strode away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tourists sending amused glances at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his formal attire and shiny "topper."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Quentin had no intention of wast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his time on a search to which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that Enid Elsmere--or Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palmer--held the clew, he promptly sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on a bench and prepared to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port failure on Burlington's return. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">preferred to postpone his talk with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl until he had Burlington off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'm in good and deep," he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected ruefully, biting the end from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar and settling down. "Now let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">get cleared up. My Enid is probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Mary Palmer, and appears to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman thief whom Osgood is after.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osgood is locked up in Mathews' shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and therefore may be eliminated as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">factor. But what about Mathews? If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worst comes to the worst, I can hire</seg><seg type="columnLine">a launch and skip out with Enid--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever her name is--and get home</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wait for arrest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I was a hero of romance, I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">probably lure Burlington up to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed and pile him in with Osgood. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">George, though! If he hadn't backed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up Enid's yarn by his own errand here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd find it hard to believe of him! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't pretend to like him a whole lot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it doesn't seem exactly probable</seg><seg type="columnLine">that such high-flown villain stunts</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be put over outside of a dime</seg><seg type="columnLine">novel. Anyhow, I'm getting to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautifully finished liar myself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This last admitted of no dispute, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outlook seemed dismal in conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quence. He saw now that he had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mistake in taking Osgood's identity</seg><seg type="columnLine">on himself with the old caretaker, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the previous evening. That in itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">might lead to undesired complications,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless Mathews arrived in time. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what would happen then ? Since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's story had been untrue, where did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mathews come in except as another</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbing factor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I don't go mad first," he laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopelessly, flinging away his cigar, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am due to catch it from all concerned!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, there's Burlington's silk tile com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down the hill, so now for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch of lies, I suppose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It flashed over him, as he stood wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, that Mary Palmer no doubt had</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocketbook for him. That must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been what she meant by her final</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation: "If I had only known</seg><seg type="columnLine">that yesterday!" Her explanation, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take a very material form; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sooner made the better, for when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had plenty of ready cash in hand he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could visit Osgood and undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">bribe him off his private revenge. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though Osgood had arrested him false-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, there might be trouble in prospect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, any luck, Quentin?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to find Burlington once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more mopping his heavy face, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pompous air somewhat dissipated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing doing," returned Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly, eying his confrere. "Seems to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me you're a whole lot excited over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, Burlington. By the way, I just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">recalled the fact that I'd heard that</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's name before--seems as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolly had mentioned an Enid Elsmere</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burlington's cheeks flushed slightly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then mottled. He forced a harsh laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're twisted, Quentin. It's rankly</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible. Now, I'm sure I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">just what to do--a house-to-house can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vass is absurd, of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Had Miss Elsmere any friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">here?" asked Quentin craftily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no, of course not!" exploded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other testily. "Since she's not at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger hotels, we might as well start</seg><seg type="columnLine">systematic inquiries along the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">front. She can't have got very far</seg><seg type="columnLine">without being seen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin nodded, thinking rapidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He might as well accompany Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton and keep him occupied in the quest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since there really was an Enid Elsmere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and since the physician was plainly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">no little mental distress over the disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance. Also, he determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">probe Burlington's mind and make sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his ground on the heiress question</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he committed himself to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite break with the other. But first</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must telephone the girl and let her</seg><seg type="columnLine">know why he could not return imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll step into the drug store here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and call up Miss Palmer," he said.

When he inquired for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Elsmere, he found that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone out; and in response to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed questions the operator switched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friend, the desk clerk, on the wire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. doctor," explained that indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidual, with a touch of malice in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, "a message came for her just</seg><seg type="columnLine">after you went v out with Doctor Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lington.

"Get his</seg><seg type="columnLine">name, and I'll reward him.

From whom?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was it possible that Mathews had--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not see just where she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">any connection with Mathews, despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">her anxiety on the subject. So he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">over thinking of it, and endeavored to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive the whole affair from his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, sit down and rest a bit," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed, when another half hour had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone by without result, save that Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lington's "poke" collar was going down</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. Quentin's quiet coolness irritated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the older man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound it!" he returned, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he obeyed the order. "You're a cold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blooded beast, Quentin!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't see the necessity of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked up over this," said Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly, seating himself beside the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"By the way, Burlington, what became</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that ward of yours?

"I'll have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask Dolly about it some time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You needn't bother," grunted Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lington. "Yes, the story was true, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got rid of the responsibility immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately afterward. I had almost forgot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten it myself. Here, have a cigar?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin accepted the weed, enjoying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the full the other man's nervous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">abrupt demeanor. That Hall Burling-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ton was a scoundrel he no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a cinch that all the crooks aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rogues' gallery," he told himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he watched the mottled and uneasy</seg><seg type="columnLine">features of the erstwhile pompous phy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sician. "I guess I'd sooner be in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes than his, right now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon this he remembered that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">something coming to him when Math-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ews arrived to release the imprisoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">detective, and asked Burlington about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat. To his dismay, he found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first one over from. San Pedro was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that on which he had come--the noon</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, which meant that he had two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours to wait. As Burlington noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his surprise, he stated that he expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet a Mr. J. M. Mathews, and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired if the other knew him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By mere name only," returned Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lington nervously.

Since they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already covered the larger hotels--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least Burlington thought they had--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the chief places of interest along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curve of the harbor, they struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">down toward the canvas city. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">than once a splash of dark red among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowds lured them in vain pursuit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the farther they went the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington lost of his precise air and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignified pose. He had plainly counted</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a small task to locate Enid Elsmere</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Avalon, and Quentin managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget his own troubles in watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington's poise grow beautifully</seg><seg type="columnLine">less.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Discord in Avalon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had never liked the older man</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly, for Burlington's cold man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner was not calculated to attract men</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. Now that this was stripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him, Quentin liked him even less;</seg><seg type="columnLine">underneath the mask lay a sheer brutal</seg><seg type="columnLine">violence which was somewhat of a sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise to him, while it bore out the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him by Mary Palmer--though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not see how she had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of it. That was a problem which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin resolutely shut out of his mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however; in some way the girl had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned how things stood, and since</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had skipped out in order to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">an explanation, he was determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">probe Burlington to the depths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally they ran across Constable</seg><seg type="columnLine">McBean, and in helpless despair Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lington called in his services to find Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elsmere; since McBean's principal duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to keep anything in the nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a disturbance under cover, he nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemnly in pledge of secrecy, and bus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled off without delay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God 1" breathed Burlington</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarsely, mopping at his face as lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the retreating blue form. 'T</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't- stand this suspense, Quentin 1 We</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have found that girl without</seg><seg type="columnLine">any trouble--I wonder what could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to her?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps she found friends," sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested Quentin cruelly, and the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. She--she was practically un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known." Burlington glanced around</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly, and Quentin made haste to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out of the sun.

Burlington wrenched at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his collar, and his heavy jaw shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">out as he glared suspiciously at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger man. "What are you trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to insinuate, Quentin? You'd better</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">watch your words-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, come, keep your self-control,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington," said Quentin sternly.

"I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit worked up, old man; you'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to overlook what I say. Come on, let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">get up to the .Metropole and sit down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit in the cool. I'm afraid I'm getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">old, Quentin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The younger man laughed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started along beside him to the hotel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A moment later, however, he suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught sight of a hatless figure a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">half block away, and stood paralyzed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no mistaking the heavy, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dershot jaw, and the burly form--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse yet, the other had seen him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have left the key of those hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuffs somewhere in Osgood's pockets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin thought.

"Here comes a chap who</seg><seg type="columnLine">took me for a housebreaker last night</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I was up at Mathews' cottage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had a scrap with him and left him</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You seem to be making the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your holiday," grunted Burlington,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin laughed a little. Fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing forth rage and vengeance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osgood came striding down on them;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face was purple with suppressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury, his clothes were torn and awry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he looked anything but prepossess-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Quentin quietly reached for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">36</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pocketbook, extracting a twenty-dollar</seg><seg type="columnLine">bill, and stood holding it unostentatious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly as the detective raged up with fists</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You--you--you-" gasped Os-</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, choked by his own vehement</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, old man!" chuckled Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasantly. "Been detained?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The detective managed to emit an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oath, but he was unarmed and plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not any great desire to taste Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin's fist again, without the requisite</seg><seg type="columnLine">backing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You come along with me, you dirty T</seg><seg type="columnLine">crook!" he stormed, careless of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing tourists who paused to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">him curiously. "I've got the goods on</seg><seg type="columnLine">you now, all right, and I'll land you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for ten years-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, what's all this row?" de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded Burlington with some asperity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had managed to regain some of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">customary air;, which, in conjunction</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his silk hat and frock coat, im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed the detective to the point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving definite and coherent answer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You can't go on like this in the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my man.

Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached up, took the star from his vest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silently folded the twenty-dollar</seg><seg type="columnLine">bill under it. "Don't you come any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your gay stuff on me, or I'll pull you</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with this pal of yours. What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">your name?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My name is Burlington, my man--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hall Burlington, M.

"A</seg><seg type="columnLine">little more of your impertinence, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'll have the officials deport you</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the island."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing weak about Hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington. For all his rage, the keen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed detective gave back before the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">other's bristling dignity; accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge men, Osgood was sobered down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the instant, being placed on the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fensive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No offense," he blurted out.

Quentin saw that his bully-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing instincts were fully aroused, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am that," retorted Osgood blunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "And if you're what you say, show</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.

Now explain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning of this outrage, or I shall take</seg><seg type="columnLine">this matter up with your superiors.

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">might need it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The detective gave him another black</seg><seg type="columnLine">look and reached out; as his hand closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the star and he felt the folded</seg><seg type="columnLine">bill, he glanced down quickly. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">black look vanished, and Quentin drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his pocketbook, telling of how it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been located.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Osgood, here are cards and</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers to establish my identity," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed easily. "As for our little scrap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you forced that yourself, but I'm quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to make it right with you. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told you the exact truth last night when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said that I had put a note under the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">door for Mr. Mathews-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know that," interrupted the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoving the bill into his pocket with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">furtive grin.

Now if the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">doc here will step over to the pier, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can fix this thing up with the officials,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I guess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin grinned to himself. Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the power of money !

Of course, Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's aid had been all-powerful, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">production of .the pocketbook had sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantiated the story, yet at the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the change in Osgood had been that</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded bill under the star. After all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's point of view largely depends on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cash in hand, thought Quentin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reckoned without his host, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever.

I clear forgot about that girl!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe the other doc here can straighten</seg><seg type="columnLine">that up, too--I mean that there Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elsmere you was toting around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh? What's that? Miss Elsmere?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington halted suddenly, his heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw falling as he stared at Osgood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin's face went white. Now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat was in the fire, indeed! Suspicion</seg><seg type="columnLine">had darted swiftly into the detective's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face once more, Burlington was star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from one to the other of them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildered surmise, and Quentin saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the show-down was imminent with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sign of Mathews in guise of rescuer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, since Mary Palmer had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, it did not matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind this chump, Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton," said Quentin hastily. "He's a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted about things-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not much !'' exclaimed the physician</seg><seg type="columnLine">savagely, his ugly jaw shoving out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This detective has been in touch with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young woman, and I intend to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out about it. Now, my man, I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know where you heard the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Elsmere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin subsided. The game was up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, and he would need all his ener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gies if he was to come out of the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">decently. He suddenly perceived that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington would be an exceedingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly customer to deal with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know a whole lot, doc," an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered the detective slowly. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">here friend of yours can tell you more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I can. I was sent from headquar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters to nab a woman thief, like I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. I spotted a blind girl with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">guy on the boat, yesterday, cornin' over</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Pedro. I butted in and asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirt's name, this guy answers up that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's Miss Enid Elsmere, and says who</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is, so I thinks maybe I've made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake. That's all I know about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady, except what come after, like I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During this brief recital Burlington's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face became black with suspicion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppressed rage. When Osgood fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, he whirled on Quentin; but for</seg><seg type="columnLine">38</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">all his anger there was a hint of fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the darting blue eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quentin, you met Miss Elsmere on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat?" he exclaimed, forcing him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self into calm. Quentin, seeing that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">still held a lash over the older man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled slightly, although his eyes hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did not," he returned flatly. "Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">did I see anything of her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burlington gasped, and took a step</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward with outstretched fist, baffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury in his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't lie to me, Quentin!" he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stormed. "I'm no-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here," and the cold acid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin's voice bit through his vehe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mence and quieted him. "I don't propose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be called a liar by you, Burlington.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This thing can be explained, but I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">an apology from you for that word, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want it now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. Osgood grinned furtively as he lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened. The steely note in Quentin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, which had failed to warn the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tective on the previous evening, had its</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect on Burlington, whose eyes rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Quentin's. The younger man's icy</seg><seg type="columnLine">coldness pierced Burlington's rage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobered him on the instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't mean to be hasty, Quentin,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he retracted. "But there's something</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind all this, and I'm going to get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Have you been trying to play with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, sir? Why have you been conceal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing your knowledge of this young lady,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pretending to help me in seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Osgood suddenly remembered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal property, and the effects of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-dollar bill faded out. He pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, facing Quentin with swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">truculence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, where's my money and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff you took from me, hey?

"Your stuff is at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel desk, waiting for you. Now get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">out of this, and let me settle matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Burlington. Your injuries are</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly personal, and you'll find your</seg><seg type="columnLine">money all safe and sound."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He impatiently shoved the burly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tective aside, but Burlington had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet done with the man. Catching his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, he whirled him about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See here, Osgood--what was this</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind girl like whom you saw with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin on the boat?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The detective gave prompt reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She had fluffy brown hair, wore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, tailored suit, and was neat as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin. The dip 1 was after had played</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the fine lady, so-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What? You're sure her hair was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not black! Was she tall or short?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tall, doc. Tall and fair"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good heavens!" Burlington took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">step back, brushing a hand across his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes in bewilderment. Osgood's tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too positive to admit of doubt, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin laughed shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, Burlington, the girl Os-</seg><seg type="columnLine">good saw with me was Miss Palmer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other. Now let's get out of this--</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can go to my room at the hotel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll have it out with you if you want it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wait!" cried Burlington hoarsely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at him. "Why did you give her</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Elsmere's name? How had you</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard anything of Miss Elsmere? If</seg><seg type="columnLine">her name was Palmer, why did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie to Osgood about it ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By thunder, that's right, doc!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurted out the detective, whirling an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grily on Ouentin. "So you gave me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bum steer, eh? I guess we ain't out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the woods on this thing yet, bo!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now come across lively, or there'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin gave him a contemptuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">look. The gathering crowd irritated</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, for he had no mind to expose his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand in public, and since the thing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come out, he determined to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aggressive before Burlington had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to do so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Discord in Avalon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''All right," he said shortly, facing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington. ''If you want it straight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend, you can have it. I've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing a heap of lying this (morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington, and it ends right here. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen to know all about Enid Elsmere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">your villainy in connection with her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">your keeping her hidden away in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, and all the rest of it. What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, you've got to move mighty softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you're going to side-step the biggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">scandal that ever woke up this part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His quiet but intense words had all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect for which he could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished. The big physician's bloodshot</seg><seg type="columnLine">face went white as he listened, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">became mottled again ; he breathed ster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torously, and there was terror in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild stare, but it was the terror of des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peration. His square jaw clamped shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly, and when Quentin had finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seemed suddenly to regain the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">of masterful poise which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing that transformation, Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that it boded trouble. Burlington</seg><seg type="columnLine">was desperate; the fact that Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew his secret meant exposure and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgrace for him, and social ruin at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least. For a moment he did not reply,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the amazed Osgood stood looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one to the other in questioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">conjecture. Quentin's abrupt change</seg><seg type="columnLine">from defense to attack had set him all</seg><seg type="columnLine">adrift.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's get out of this," exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington, once more becoming aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crowd. His sudden calm was</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything but reassuring. "Quentin, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't settle this thing here in the street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come along to your room at the hotel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, I guess I'll trot along," broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Osgood, as Burlington took a step</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Quentin hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This matter is between ourselves,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began, but the physician swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">around with a savage oath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No, by- Osgood, you come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">along with us and see this thing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">through. I fancy I'll have some use</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you in a mighty short time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, catching his malevolent look,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin led the way to the hotel with</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreboding in his heart. He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fathom Burlington's intent, but he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the man was dangerous--terribly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous, and the more so for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced calm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XII.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a strained silence on all</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of the men as they strode into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel lobby. Osgood went over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk, and Quentin followed him; while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the detective was getting the envelope</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing his personal belongings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin made inquiries after the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He found that she had not returned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and doubted no longer that she was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pickpocket and had seized the chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get away. Osgood looked up at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, doc, I ain't got any hard feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings; I guess you're square, after all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But what's the row between you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other doc?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin glanced across at Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, who was waiting by the elevator,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shrugged his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come along and see. If I'm not</seg><seg type="columnLine">much mistaken, you'll be able to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arrest yet, Osgood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they crossed back and rejoined</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington, Quentin determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">force the issue squarely. What the</seg><seg type="columnLine">points of the law were, he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know; but he fancied that he could at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least make a charge against the Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beach man which would force the mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter into the courts. There was no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in some manner Mary Palmer had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned Burlington's secret, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the under channels used by</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooks to obtain such knowledge; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that she was indeed a thief</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck Quentin hard, but he knew now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the story was true enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With tense silence still prevailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">among the three, they reached Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin's room. Burlington dropped into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, smoothed back his graying hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his most precise fashion, and faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, sir," he said, breathing hard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but forcing himself into self-control,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you will kindly explain your veiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">charges against me. I am bitterly sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised in you, Allan Quentin, and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less you make a satisfactory explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, you shall suffer for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not intend to explain," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned Quentin coldly. "That will come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from you. I suppose you will admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Enid Elsmere is your ward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that owing to her affliction you have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of her income?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, you scoundrel!" burst out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, quivering with rage. "I'll not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only admit it, but I'll make you admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">where you got that information!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By your own words you confess</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you have kept the matter quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington. Your friends know nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her being in your house; you've de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberately attempted to keep her seques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered so that you might enjoy her</seg><seg type="columnLine">money; you've lied to her about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition, and since you told me this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning that the girl you were after</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a brain tumor, a simple operation</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have fixed her up. The courts</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have given you control of her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington, but I doubt whether you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep it long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that, he turned to Osgood, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was chewing an unlit cigar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know what charge covers</seg><seg type="columnLine">this case, Osgood, but I guess you un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand enough of the situation. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I demand that you arrest Doctor Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lington there on my charge, and I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear against him; the girl has es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caped from his hands, and she'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">located quickly enough when this thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets into the open."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Osgood reached down into his pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and produced his handcuffs hesitantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, doc, I ain't quite sure myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I'll take a chance-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not so fast, there!" Burlington</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped to his feet quickly. "I intend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay a charge here myself. Osgood, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Quentin with a presumably blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl yesterday, whom he passed off as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Elsmere; since you've heard what</seg><seg type="columnLine">has passed between us, you know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Elsmere was my ward by legal</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, and if I've thought fit to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">her secluded, that's my affair and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours.

"Osgood, arrest that man!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I charge him with conspiracy and at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted blackmail; he and that pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended charge of his, whom he passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">off 011 you as Miss Elsmere and on me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Miss Palmer, are in this thing to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. I charge them with kidnaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ward and getting her out of the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a conspiracy to extort money from</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I'll fix you, you damned scoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drel !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin's mouth tightened into a set</seg><seg type="columnLine">line as he faced the other, longing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant his fist on the big jaw. Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton acted out his part well, helped by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the furious rage which consumed him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young surgeon saw that Osgood</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wavering, and perceived at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Burlington had managed to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tables on him very neatly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, he knew what the others did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not--that Mary Palmer had ^slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, that she was the "dip" for whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osgood was looking, and that when</seg><seg type="columnLine">this complication came out the charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">made by Burlington would be tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendously strengthened.

Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, however, was only maddened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound it, do I have to arrest him</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself? I'll call in the officials here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless you act at once! Get hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his woman accomplice, and do it lively;</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you refuse to arrest him, I'll take</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of the scoundrel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That suits me," and Osgood rubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jaw with a reflective grin at Quen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tin. "That's a good idea, doc. Where's</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lady pal of yours?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Quentin gave up. Osgood's keen per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception had pierced to the nub of things</seg><seg type="columnLine">--which happened to be Mary Palmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and there was no use putting off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitable any longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Had not Burlington interfered at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">junction, Quentin would simply have</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed the whole affair in the detective's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, and let things take their course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But at Osgood's exclamation, Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton hastily turned toward the door, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage determination in his features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'll attend to her myself!" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared hotly. "You take care of Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin, and I'll bring the woman here-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With this, Quentin's cold restraint</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave way. Deciding instantly that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would at least have the satisfaction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting Burlington in his place, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted forward and whirled in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door with a swift push that sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington staggering back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That's enough from you!" he cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes flaming. "You're not going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bully any more women, Burlington--</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless you do it inside State's prison."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other leaned against the table a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, glaring and panting heavily. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">that instant Quentin knew that he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">'subdue or go under; Burlington's pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erful face expressed determination to</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence him at whatever cost. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">future of each man depended upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet in Burlington's face Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">read a swift cunning that he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fathom, a purpose which was Hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Him. He was soon to learn its</seg><seg type="columnLine">import, however.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Get away from that door, Quentin!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped the older man, stepping for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward once more. "Bear witness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm only trying to get out of this room,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Osgood-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Goaded beyond endurance, Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasted no more words. Burlington</seg><seg type="columnLine">came at him. and, without hesitation, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove out his fist; the blow caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">42</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">other on the cheek and sent him reeling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Burlington attempted no return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Arrest him--for assault!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped, clinging to a chair. Too late,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin saw the plan, but he gave Os-</seg><seg type="columnLine">good 110 chance to intervene. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">played into his enemy's hand, but he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined to do it thoroughly while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a swift step forward, he sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fist crashing into Burlington's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, and the larger man bent back</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the table. He writhed away, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">again Quentin's knuckles found him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time for a clean blow under the ear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington shot headfirst into the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, and Quentin found the burly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tective gripping his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Easy does it, doc--easy does it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed Osgood firmly. Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked him in the eye, half wrenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, then the cold flame of anger died</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of his face, and he laughed shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Osgood. I'll not touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">you or him, either. Let go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're under arrest, sir," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other quietly, stepping back. "Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">let's see what you did to the big doc.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Say, you've got a great little kick in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that right of yours! Look at him!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin looked down at Burlington, •</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was slowly gaining his feet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted with great satisfaction that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three blows he had landed would leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">their marks for some time. The detec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive pulled up the fallen physician, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoved him into a chair, but Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton staggered up, still furious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By -, put that , man under ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest!" he foamed, beside himself with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rage. "He's assaulted me-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got him under arrest, doc," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osgood, forcing him back into the chair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now, you sit down and cool off a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm cool enough, my man," retorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burlington. "You'd better get hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman and arrest her also 011 my</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'd better not, Osgood," put in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin calmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The detective coolly disregarded him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stepped to the wall telephone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What name does she go under here</seg><seg type="columnLine">--what's her alias, doc?" he asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning toward Quentin.

He had made a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">mess of things now, he reflected. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had virtually forced himself under ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest, the hand of circumstance had</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched about his neck, and Burlington</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have little difficulty iii making</seg><seg type="columnLine">good his charge of conspiracy when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole miserable story had been dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">into court.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After all, what had he on which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">base his own charges? Nothing but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of a woman he did not know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and who was herself a fugitive from</seg><seg type="columnLine">justice, combined with some trifling cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstantial evidence which Burlington</seg><seg type="columnLine">could easily explain away. Still, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be court records of Burlington's</seg><seg type="columnLine">guardianship, but unless the real Enid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elsmere was to be produced as a wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness against him, Burlington would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">an easy time squirming out of Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin's charge--especially when the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been placed under arrest for as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sault, and might be facing a hatched-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">conspiracy charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say," exclaimed Osgood, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the telephone with a black look,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I guess you done me out of pinching</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dip after all, doc.

"Is she gone?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gone is right, big doc." Osgood was</seg><seg type="columnLine">far recovered from the influence of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-dollar bill by this time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed it plainly. "But I got this guy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I got him right now. Doc, slip out</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Discord in Avalon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">your wrists for the bracelets, and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fooling."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin, beyond 'words, put out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands as Osgood came up. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clink and a click, and the handcuffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">w-ere upon him. At this instant the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone bell rang, and Osgood an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure!" he said quickly. "Send 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hung up the receiver and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all right, doc," he said, ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressing Burlington.

Burlington started up, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the detective waved him back with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">confident grin, and moved over so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was in position to grip whoever</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come in!" he cried, and the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIII.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes'm, you're pinched," grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osgood, with his hand on the shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mary Palmer. She faced him, seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly without surprise, and Quentin saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had given over all pretense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On a charge of conspiracy, young</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman," thundered out Burlington im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressively as he came down the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagging his forefinger. "Officer, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall appear before both of these per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think you will, Burlington,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a voice from the doorway. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then silence fell suddenly, and Burling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton stood as if paralyzed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking at the doorway, Quentin</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw there an elderly man of command-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing presence, whose Southern goatee</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly bristled with indignation. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm was about the shoulders of a girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and Quentin emitted a gasp as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that she was clad in red, with black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair that flew over her shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come in, Uncle Jim," said Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palmer quietly. "This is Doctor Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin, who seems to be once more under</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrest!" And she flashed Quentin a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright smile. "Doctor, this is my uncle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Mathews. And this--is Enid Els-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burlington said no word, but col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapsed into the chair behind him, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers clawing at the table, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face suddenly gone to a mottled hue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And this," went on the girl, mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioning toward the detective, "is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Osgood of whom I told you, uncle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quentin rose, smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry I can't shake hands, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mathews," he said, and the tension was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take those handcuffs off Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin, Osgood!" ordered Mathews,</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting Enid Elsmere behind him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing. The girl stood, weeping, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face in her hands. "I think you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why--yes, Mr. Mathews," gasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the detective, with unexpected defer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. "I didn't forget that murder case,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then do as I say!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry, sir," and Osgood shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. "This gentleman assaulted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big doc over there, and I had to pinch</seg><seg type="columnLine">him whether I wanted to or not."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mathews whirled on the crumpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure in the chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Withdraw that charge, Burlington,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and do it quickly!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the cold menace in his voice, Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lington shivered, gasped, and nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the detective. A moment later Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin rubbed his wrists, and Osgood stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with the handcuffs dangling, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one to the other in perplexity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Arrest this man Burlington," went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Mathews, but before he could finish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other sprang up with a choking</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--no, for God's sake, Mathews!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down--shut up, you hound, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll thrash you myself!" exploded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mathews, and Burlington crumpled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, utterly unnerved. "Now let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">get this thing straight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mary Palmer had her arms about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind girl, and as Quentin stepped over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and glanced into the latter's face, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that here there was no deception.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he looked at Mary Palmer--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the violet eyes smiling into his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does all this mean?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. At the question, Mathews</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to him and motioned Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palmer to speak. The girl laughed hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pily, glancing from Osgood back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin, and addressing both at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her rather confused explanation--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was perfectly clear to both, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, my uncle--Mr. Mathews here</seg><seg type="columnLine">--was to meet me in Los Angeles, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way from Phoenix to visit him. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed him and came on alone. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Pedro I found poor Enid here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid to speak to any one, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I asked her what the matter was she</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst into tears and told me the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">story--just as I told it to you, Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quentin. I did not know what to do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the poor girl was helpless and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">distress, and said she wanted to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">my uncle, who would protect her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was afraid that Doctor Burlington</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come after her, so I found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">policeman and asked him if he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take care of her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He happened to know my uncle by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight, and^had seen him that morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">--yesterday, but now it seems a year</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago! He promised to take care of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Enid and to hand her over to my uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he came back after having missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and I went on the boat to go on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the island. Then I saw you, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osgood, and you looked at me so hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">that--that it made me afraid, and--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And so you made up to me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">played blind, eh?" laughed Quentin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he understood the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Mathews had arrived at San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro on his way back, had been met</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the policeman and the real Enid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had hastened over to the island.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That explained the message which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come for Mary Palmer, and why</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had gone out. Upon meeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mathews, she had brought him back--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what about the pickpocket ? Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin whirled on the detective, smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess you lose out on your lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">dip prisoner, Osgood! Kind of bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">on your reputation, isn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I don't know," and the detec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive rubbed at his chin as he cast a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at the crumpled figure in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. "As near's I get you, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mathews, I'm to pinch the big doc over</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weeping unrestrainedly, the blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl loosed her arms from around Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palmer and turned, with a little plead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gesture that was terribly pathetic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," she cried, her voice choked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sobs. "Please, Mr. Mathews,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">please don't-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, little girl; all right," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mathews gathered her in his arms for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, comforting her. Then, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie lifted his head and gazed across her</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaming black hair, his voice bit into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crumpled figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Burlington, get out of here!

The Witch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Endor's masts are sticking up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue sky and she traipses down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see her.

I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was suddenly changed. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know just how you'd explain it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something about the way he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at her that told me she'd altered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his point of view. He went down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main deck with her and showed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about the Witch. I could hear 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking, and now and then there'd float</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the quarter-deck, where I was sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting, that little, tinkling, pretty laugh of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thinks I, Tantor never behaved that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way before. And when they ^ame back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the quarter-deck, and I saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile in answer to her smile I felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">something had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't a week before Tantor Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin came to me, and said he was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to marry Gertrude Laws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You !"

I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen quite a bit of the girl, and I--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked her. She was as fresh and whole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some as a breeze across an orchard, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was beautiful, too, with that strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">loveliness that changes and has little</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows of sadness about it, and little</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights of passion and all very girlish</seg><seg type="columnLine">and natural and innocent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," says he, "I'm going to marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.

"And I'll bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">her down here for supper. She thinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">there ought to be some third person</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we eat together, so I told her you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were skipper of the ship and you'd eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks," says I, actually forgetting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to call him down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if anybody thinks he can make</seg><seg type="columnLine">any remarks about her," he goes on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll show him something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The only remark I have to make is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you have enough nerve to stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">a battleship," I returned.

"She don't like it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," I told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And no rough language about."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're still mate of this packet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's up to you," I remarked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that evening just about sunset</seg><seg type="columnLine">she came down with Tantor striding</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside of her. It was a pretty sight:</seg><seg type="columnLine">big, coarse Tantor with a new look on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face, and the girl laughing up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and glancing at the shipping and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky and the crisp water with bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">We had a supper fit for a king.

The cook</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly died of pleasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When it was full dark I took Tantor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Gertrude up on the quarter-deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he showed her all the harbor lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I smoked my pipe. Then I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em to enjoy themselves on deck--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a fine night--and went over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit Captain Nelson on the Beaver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nelson and I had a yarn, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wandered back to the Witch of Endor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see the watchman's lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning under the break of the fo'c's'le</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and the glimmer of the lamp in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cook's room amidships. I stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the bulwarks a moment to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the stars and wonder why a sailor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">life is so lonely. I heard voices. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl and Tantor, above me on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter-deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to teach school!" she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying in her fresh, girlish voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you've got to marry me," says</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, quite gently for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," she protested, "I don't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get married!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, you do," Martin puts in. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll tell you why: because I love you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I can't bear to see you alone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world, and I'm strong enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look after you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, I stepped away for a while,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when I came back Tantor wras just</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming ashore with the girl on his arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was happy. And she was happy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. They merely called good night to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and hurried off to catch the trolley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had to lie in San Pedro for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time that trip, waiting for a cargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Seattle, and all that time Tantor</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked and acted like a man who'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought himself in torment and sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly found that he was in heaven. Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trude used to come down to the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">every afternoon, and they'd sit on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stringer and talk. I knew that trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coming, but what business was it</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mine?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You see Burton of the Hazel saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">all this and he fell in love with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, too. You knew him--a smooth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet, dangerous fellow. He was aw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully nice to Gertrude, and she, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">that kind of girl that likes everybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knows no evil, took him for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he professed to be. And she made</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tantor Martin smile at him. Tantor</seg><seg type="columnLine">even forget his old grudge against Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, though he remembered that Burton</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been no friend of his during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time they were thrashing out the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of the Tam O'Shanter and Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Dare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Burton began openly to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">love to the girl. She suddenly found</seg><seg type="columnLine">out what lie was doing, and I've never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen such a pitiful sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you're in love with me!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried out one evening when Tantor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I were busy in the cabin over some</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers, and she was enjoying the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the wharf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the sound of the words, Martin</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep still!" I warned him. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">both listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is so lovely to be in love and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible to be in love wrong," she went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. I could fairly see the tears in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely eyes. "And you're in love with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and I can't help you at all. I'm so</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit still!" I told Tantor. "Remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber that every man's love is his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair. Leave it to her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we sat there--forgetting the pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers--and listened. I suppose Burton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">black heart really beat for her, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so pure and kind and gentle. At any</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate, he was in earnest and went away</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last in silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," said I, "go and don't let her</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand that you overheard. She is</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry for him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Martin left, and I heard her run to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and ask him to take her back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Los Angeles. A moment later they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Girl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the next day Tantor brooded over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing. He went about his work</seg><seg type="columnLine">much like he had done in the old days--</seg><seg type="columnLine">with curses on his lips and ugly looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">for those who crossed him. That night</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told me she wouldn't come down</seg><seg type="columnLine">that evening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Natural," I said. "My heavens, do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you expect the girl to be here every</seg><seg type="columnLine">night? I don't notice you calling where</seg><seg type="columnLine">she lives."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It wouldn't do," he told me. "She's</seg><seg type="columnLine">living at some woman's hotel where</seg><seg type="columnLine">men can't call without getting the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tron down on them. She doesn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, but I do, and I wouldn't have any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing happen to make her even think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrong things that so many people</seg><seg type="columnLine">think." He looked at me with those</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim eyes of his and added: "So long</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I live she'll never even have to listen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to suggestions of what life can be made</seg><seg type="columnLine">when one is wicked."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was right and I said nothing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was protecting the purity of her love</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him, the gentle and pure rffection</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was like an altar candle in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. Tantor Martin was decent. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't even urging her to marry him</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly because he was afraid. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl--the woman one loves--is sacred--</seg><seg type="columnLine">even when one marries her--I under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood Tantor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Burton's love for her had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to something infernal. It showed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin was right in hating him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the girl and told her--stories.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He invited her on board the Hazel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she went, like a friendly child. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said more, the things that burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scorched the girl. She said noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but went to her boarding place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Los Angeles and confided in the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tron. Some good women unlock the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors of hell without knowing it. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged the whole story of Gertrude's</seg><seg type="columnLine">engagement to Tantor out and said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">single thing: "You have compromised</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself. No good girl would go down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to a ship and meet a sailor without</seg><seg type="columnLine">being a bad woman.

But women don't un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand other women, I guess. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent matron did not know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gertrude wouldn't, couldn't go to Tan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor. - She had put the stain on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure and lovely relations. The girl was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickened at the thought that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unworthy of Tantor--that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">soiled the pure character she must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be his wife. She thought--it's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way women think--that what that ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tron had said was true: she was not fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be the wife of a good man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She went to Burton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was it because she knew him to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beast and a scoundrel? Was it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause she thought that she was sinful</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no other course was open except</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go to people stained like herself ? Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">was it because she wished to forever</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut herself out of the heaven she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">forfeited? You and I can't tell. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">she went down to Burton and told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the matron had said, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled and then frowned and told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">that though every one else turned her</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, he loved her and she could come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him and be protected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sailed that night for Honolulu.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was four o'clock in the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Martin kicked my door in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me. He had been up to the board-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing place and the matron had informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him of what she had said and done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tantor listened and cursed the woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he came back to San Pedro and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found Burton had sailed and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl was on board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going for her," he told me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How?"

Come with me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll take her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat up and argued with him. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">told him plainly that he hadn't money</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough nor had I to charter that steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er for a wild-goose chase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And she belongs to the men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked you out," I added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glowered on me. "Will you come</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me to save the girl? I hear her</seg><seg type="columnLine">crying out there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waved his great hand toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pacific, and it seemed as if I did actual-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly hear a woman sobbing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried to do something with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was mad. The end of it was I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed and we went down the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">front to the Tam O'Shanter, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying with steam up, ready to sail in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Luckily the captain was ashore, else</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would have had more trouble. As it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, Tantor raged aboard, got the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gineer into a blue funk, and himself cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the lines while the mate and deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands--who knew him of old--feebly</seg><seg type="columnLine">protested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was as plain a case of piracy as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever you saw. We simply seized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship and went to sea in a dark mist</seg><seg type="columnLine">that filled the channel with murky shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ows that made the course to Dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man's Island a mystery. Tantor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wheel. We barely missed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">government dredge and tailed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar--we were beyond the islands an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour after sunrise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was noon when the crew of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tam O'Shanter wakened to the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were in charge of a skipper</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had no business on their ship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were bound for Honolulu in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of Puget Sound. The mate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief engineer put their heads to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether and tried to reason with Tantor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am ashamed to say that I backed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up--there was no more trouble. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tam O'Shanter made a good fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">knots an hour with double watches in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fireroom. Martin kept the wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Late that night we saw the stern light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Hazel, a mere flicker of flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew I'd catch him," Tantor said</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarsely. "I used to make this old</seg><seg type="columnLine">packet log sixteen knots. When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged old Dare out of the breakers</seg><seg type="columnLine">off Blanco I had fifty pounds more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed in the boilers. And I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what course that Burton would take.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keep the wheel while I see about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you intend to do?" I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded. "Burton won't stop for you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're absolutely crazy. All you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">do is follow him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that so?" retorted Martin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Watch me. I leave you in charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this packet. I have work to do, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, almost imperceptibly, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept up on that little light that marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the girl was crying. At four in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning it was less than a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. Tantor had been raging up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the decks, using his fists and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue to such effect that the mate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tam O'Shanter had taken to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and refused to come out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a raw, dark, misty morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as one gets off the lower coast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">California once in a while. The sea was</seg><seg type="columnLine">running along in great, smooth rollers</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed to stream in endless array</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the blackness and hasten toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the invisible shore. The Tam O'Shan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter was shaking to the tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust of her engines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In half an hour we'll be up to them,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told Tantor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll take the bridge then," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Understand, obey my orders to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word. When I'm done, you take</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We surged along, and I caught once</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a while the glint of the white water</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the counter of the Hazel. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">other moments I would catch the shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ow of fresh smoke against the lowering</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. By her masthead light and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights along her starboard side, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that she was heading up, evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Girl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to make us buck the light sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was running.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In fifteen minutes I'll show you</seg><seg type="columnLine">something," said Tantor, thrusting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in at the wheelhouse window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time I studied the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. You've seen him. He's a pirate.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you say. I fancy Columbus looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he did when his crew mutinied. Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Columbus was a pirate. They don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">say it in the schoolbooks, but a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who'd seize a whole hemisphere must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been some person. And Tantor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin was seizing a whole world just</seg><seg type="columnLine">then. I stuck to the wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep to starboard of him," he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think that Burton realized at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last that Tantor was after him. I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose he was afraid, anyway, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie had first seen our lights he had put</seg><seg type="columnLine">on more steam. But now the Hazel</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply leaped through the long, purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">swells. I could see the glimmer of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water breaking over her bows. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">down below in the bowels of the Tam</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Shanter the firemen wielded shovels</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slice bars so vigorously that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the clang of them in the wheel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was nip and tuck for the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. Then the Hazel began to slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and we forged up. I steered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward her. Tantor banged the weather</seg><seg type="columnLine">window open and said: "Keep away</seg><seg type="columnLine">to starboard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you \Vant to get alongside!" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">protested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You do what I tell you," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glaring at me. I did. We kept to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor'ard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was in the gray of the dawn that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we passed the Hazel. It was clear as</seg><seg type="columnLine">water that Burton thought he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong and that we weren't after him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He slacked down his engines, and, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun rose, we were a mile ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. I could hear Tantor raging back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forth on the bridge overhead. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the trap hatch opened, and he called</seg><seg type="columnLine">down : "Starboard your helm !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I put the wheel over slowly, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tam O'Shanter rolled around till the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swells that were running out the north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">west were broad on the bow. The Hazel</seg><seg type="columnLine">was then on the port beam and coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly along. 1 heard the jangle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine-room telegraph. As I steadied</seg><seg type="columnLine">her on the new course I saw that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going to cross the Hazel's bows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the telegraph rang again and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throb of the machinery ceased. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tam O'Shanter rolled slowly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trough of the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think that nothing of what was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen entered my head. I think I still</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard vaguely the sobbing of a woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seems as if that was the general im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression I got while I waited. I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">I also heard the tramp of Tantor Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin on the bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thing that stands out most</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly in my mind is the sudden real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ization that the Hazel was steaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">along within a quarter of a mile and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were slowly but steadily mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward her, we rolling in the hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea. It suddenly occurred to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were going to cross her bows</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the engines started. Tantor was tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing chances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then came the sharp clang of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telegraph--full speed ahead. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer came from the chief and I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel slowly regain her speed. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">eased the wheel, wondering whether we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should pass astern of the Hazel or</seg><seg type="columnLine">range alongside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You must understand thatr it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful morning; the sun had risen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and burned up the mist; the swell rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward with a slow and powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweep; the sky above us was clear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystalline. There was not even a cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cling gull to catch the eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I eased the helm a little more. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hazel was drawing closer and I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Burton's figure on the bridge. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had his glasses fixed on us. It was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly clear that he was puzzled. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him turn and consult his mate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then lie leaped to the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge and pulled the whistle cord. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the plume of steam had vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pellucid air, I heard the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the warning blast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly I was shaken by the bellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our own siren. And then I under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood. That sound throbbing upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the beautiful air was the call of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to his mate. I caught the roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tantor's voice, telling me to keep my</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. I did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I can still see the great, blank, black</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the Hazel as she gave us her</seg><seg type="columnLine">unprotected flank. I can still see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tam O'Shunter's powerful bows thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward and into her heart. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came shouts, the ringing of gongs, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow, steady pulse of the engines be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath my feet. With our stem deep in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her vitals, the Hazel slowly died on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think that there was little time be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the instant of our impact and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild leap of Tantor Martin to the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck of the Hazel. Where he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl, I don't know. But he reap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared amidst our gesticulating crowd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she was in his arms. He regained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge, and I heard the .harsh clang</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gongs, signaling full speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">astern. The Tam O'Shanter slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed out, and the other steamer</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurched drunkenly as the water poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her hold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're drowning people!" I bawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up through the trap hatch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the only answer I heard was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">6obbing of a woman. -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we left the Hazel, sinking into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear, pure sea, into the dark depths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pacific, while her crew fought at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boats and leaped downward like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nuts falling from a tree. We left her</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly, without looking backward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And on the bridge Tantor Martin stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his grim, cruel eyes fixed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of Captain Burton, who was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the starboard side of the after deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelling for the single boat that had got</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to come back for him. The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung to the railing, blind with tears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, I got a man at the wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watched the whole affair. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">confess that I said nothing. I picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up what men of the Hazel's crew I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, and then I allowed the Tam</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Shanter to speed on her course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burton went down with his ship, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelling maniac, a coward in death as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been in life. As the Hazel plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward at the last, I saw the smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">of five revolver shots. He was firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly into the men on a life raft. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">he died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We reached San Pedro, and Tantor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin got the lines ashore and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to me, who was again in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheelhouse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm responsible," he said to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'd best say that you were kid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naped."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''The girl?"

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">stoker who had come up for a breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">of air and been swept off by a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea, so the story went. I looked at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my lips were hard bitten. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me more, far more, than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The man was careless," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I was--very nearly," I added</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsteadily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shot me a glance from the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the doorway which I may have mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">read, but which to me meant pity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what's to be your own part,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mac?"

"Tinker Bill, d'ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind? Everybody's friend that makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engines go. Engines have to go,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever.

Nothing could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been plainer. For the sake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">58</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve a month and the job he meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to play safe, come what might.

Bent toward me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one hand hidden in his jacket</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What do you want?"

Funny thing, 'int it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He giggled again with an assumption</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ease, and drew his hand almost os-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentatiously from the pocket, empty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And presently I felt better.

A faithful fellow and a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">right sailor. A Loyalty Islander born,</seg><seg type="columnLine">long a wanderer among the pidgin</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports.

It was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual thing for him to carry mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sages, and I feared no treachery in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this.

We met no one. The way was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear as we climbed to the thwartship</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor under the house. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">what decided him, perhaps. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very top of the companionway he</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered over, swung back, and gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">me by the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You 110 say, s'pose I tell you some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, Mass' Hugh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at him, with the crinkle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve I had learned of late.

I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">move right in--with thanks to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A refusal would have meant a break</seg><seg type="columnLine">right there, an open avowal of bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith. He didn't want it, I saw that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the glint in his eye damned me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a future reward as he searched my face</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know, I find you improved</seg><seg type="columnLine">already, Keating, my boy," he purred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's interesting.

"Yes, I've been getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatment. Rather heroic. I'll take</seg><seg type="columnLine">that cabin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His glance widened on me. Then,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with a little fleering bow-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, invalids must be served," he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided.

The bite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it! I stumbled out upon the bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck.

That the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain now mistrusted them was no aid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was too late. He was at Bane's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercy. As we all were, it began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear. As we all were. Bane, the ace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all the trumps. With the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargo a lone card against the pack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellen! To go to her. To bring her</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe. She' was wandering about in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this nest of villainy alone, at her whim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anything might happen. These fiends</seg><seg type="columnLine">were everywhere. Bane's men. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had kept him at arm's length until</seg><seg type="columnLine">now only by evasion, by subtle parry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and check of his advances. I had seen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">much-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How soon might he tire?

I could not endure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of her so far away. Her place</seg><seg type="columnLine">was near her father. Some little pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection, at least. The best she had. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">one defense from these wolves-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I swarmed the ladder to the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge, her name on my lips. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not there. I missed the flash of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tam along the length of the ship. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">black-avised fellow known as Dingo</seg><seg type="columnLine">was holding the wheel. He scowled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my query and shook his head. I caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the revolver again in my pocket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoured down to the decks like a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ^ found her at last, after a breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less search.

I came up upon the poop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there she was, pacing a strip by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">taffrail. As far from the bridge as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">well could get.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It need have been no great task, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose, to warn her, to put her on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her guard, and that not too rudely. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">such task.

It was there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwasted by the tawdry dishonesties of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sex and sentiment. Of the sun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air and the open spaces, true as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southeast trade.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that, too, who had followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lure of her without hope. Warm with</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth, dear and desirable. And sweet-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tempered with it all. No spark of</seg><seg type="columnLine">malice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she spoke, she was trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give me the best of it, as she always did</seg><seg type="columnLine">with every one, as it was her impulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something has worried you, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keating," she said hesitantly.

Wouldn't it be better if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we talked more simply?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't," I answered.

To her, in her inno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cence, the whole thing must have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed overwrought, an access of rant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fantasy.

Another time I might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered to see him so employed. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke sidelong at him, gauging my</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice to his ear:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''You big, flap-eared Swede, you!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What the hell do you mean by annoy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Miss Kendrick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was half kneeling on the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the rail break, wrestling with a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of stiff canvas.

The little lady-" he stam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've been speaking to her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've been bothering her.

His chest heaved once. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember how the faded letters on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">old blue jersey, a relic of service aboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">some British India boat, stood plain for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant. Then:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't bother," he cried, in a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect gale of protest. "No. I never!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">That lady, she been gude friend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine. Always she been so kind.

Why, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridiculous creature was actually at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of tears. I felt like one who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupidly wronged a child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Does she say I bother her?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no," I said hastily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He subsided, turning a timid glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">aft toward where I had left her. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sat looking down at the clumsy bulk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him in what was very close to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sternation. Here was anticlimax to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferment, if you like. A villain who</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned out to be a sentimentalist. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caliban who could weep!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You signed on at Sydney?"

This man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this extraordinary misfit, had been liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the forecastle at bared fang with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole bunch.

"There's deviltry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You know it. I know it. What are they</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head. He would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak. It was the stubbornness of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock, of a man with one thought. Like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly he had held it from the start. I began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fear he would hold it still. With me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here, Carl. Here's the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady. She's in danger. You must know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. You've been watching over her?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw that it was so. I wondered how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much we had to thank the dogged, si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent giant that disaster had been warded</seg><seg type="columnLine">off so far. We could not know. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">never did know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I made one more trial of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Carl, I'm trying to take care of her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep her from harm.

Beyond that he would not go.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither betray the doings or plans of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fellows, who were also his enemies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Because he was made that way, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that strange streak of loyalty. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">having chosen his course he would stick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through threats or blandishments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He crouched there at his work. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, lumbering hulk of a man. Turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a shoulder to me as to some buzzing</seg><seg type="columnLine">pest. Deaf. Locked again with the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">red flower of emotion that flared in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim chamber of his mind. Unheeding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloof-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I got up and went to Ellen, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gesture led her down past the quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terboat. She did not understand. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man did, and I saw the tips of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear flush as he bent over his task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Carl," I* called aside, as we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, "what do you say now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He squirmed, he fumbled at the can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vas with huge, wandering hands. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused there. While the deck tilted</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down again. While Ellen's</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance questioned me mildly. While the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseen watchers forward, I suppose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">craned to see what we had to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who didn't belong. Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much as lifting his head, he spoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this was the astonishing thing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung at us:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Run on--run on, f' Gol' sake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss.

For Ellen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a word, and with a face gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">white as the spray, turned forward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gude morning, miss," he mumbled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching his ragged cap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good morning, Carl," she answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last I saw of him he was sprawl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the canvas, a huge, loutish fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure.

Down from the poop, picking</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way along the deck. It was a jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney to strain better nerves than mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw the turbaned rascal slip by on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other side--a Frenchman, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">chap, with a ticket to Noumea stamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain as print on his hangdog brow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My pussy-footed friend, Perrin, ducked</seg><seg type="columnLine">from somewhere and favored me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sneaking grin. There were more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them near. Lurking for some chance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might be, some order. Ringing us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sly surveillance. But none of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke, nor hindered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suspense dragged upon our steps like</seg><seg type="columnLine">shackles--mine, at least. Ellen seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm, though very pale, I kept my re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver close to hand-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In all, I suppose we took three min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes to reach the bridge. Certainly not</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than five, for we were not much</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded to linger any great time. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused by the rail once and again when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel lurched wide. Five minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">say. But within that space the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had just topped the ladder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were turning for the house with a first</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier breath when the yell started,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocketing from aft, mounting the keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">blare of the gale, long drawn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mournful. A sailor tumbled past be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low through the alleyway from the fore</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck. Others popped from the foc'sle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ma-an o'rboard!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hammer of feet, hoarse clamor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices, split by the shrill of the bosn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle. The ship boiled with sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement. As if a stage wait had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended with a clap of hands that sent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">company breaking from the wings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a singular thing to me, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I stood there, how the impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced from me. Surprise and appre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hension, I felt, but no throb of convic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, of the eager pity and resolve men</seg><seg type="columnLine">know at that cry. The running and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting figures had the sham effect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill-trained actors who overplayed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts. For the impression, I might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in a balcony looking down over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the footlights coldly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I watched the bearded face of Far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ralone Jim leap by beneath me, uplifted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bawling, with little red-rimmed eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright as jet. I got the flash, somehow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of repulsive burlesque, as of a wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slack mouth grinning behind the heavy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">beard-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Came Captain Kendrick, bouncing</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a flabby purple ball, but lashing or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders with rapid-fire precision. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">real, at least; I caught the thrill from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The man was rejuvenated for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. Whatever his flaws, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still the skipper, keying to command at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the call.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some one had signaled the engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, with a jangle of bells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Throw that back!" he roared to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper bridge. -"Full ahead, there. Put</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her a-stabbord!

There slid a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den hush upon the turmoil--the insuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a wave before its foaming--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged Ellen out from them, seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get our backs to some barrier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There never yet had been a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which the cabin guard offered such</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy prey to any outbreak.

Why, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know, save that it suited him. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">how--I had seen that.

One instant, a mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny at the crest. The next, a prompt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and busy crew. This was the kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who was running the Colleen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bazvn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drew the skipper a step.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can she live in that sea, sir, do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think?" he asked respectfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We all stared out over the clamber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blue slopes where the wind, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">risen to fury, winnowed its spume.

No</seg><seg type="columnLine">hamlet too insignificant, no tale too thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">to draw one of these argus-eyed men</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of miles to watch a so-called</seg><seg type="columnLine">"comer" work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, at the end of the season, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the scouts have landed one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ability enough to gain a bare try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in spring training, they have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, and their salaries are more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">earned. All this for even an outfielder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pitchers, the Brahmans of baseball, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely ever picked up except at tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mejideus expense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, this young Quinlan had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been heard of before. He had dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Long Horn while the High Rollers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were beginning their spring training to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the regulars into shape and the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruits a chance to show the stuff they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were made of. One thing was certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">--he had unlimited nerve. In the lobby</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the little Texas hotel he had braced</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scrappy Bill Joslin and asked for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the best card of introduction</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could have produced. Joslin loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve, and this was something more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than nerve--pure, unadulterated gall it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was for any man to imagine he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">a show to get on the pay roll of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">High Rollers, always winning or scrap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping it out for the pennant in the big-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gest league of them all. Laughingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joslin had consented. He ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh when Pop McClung reported to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that night. Not only was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster worthy of a show, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed likely to win a place on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">team. Joslin kept his weather eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">150</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Story Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">peeled the following day, scanning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">volunteer recruit's work keenly, search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was impossible that this fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be of big-league stuff. Yet, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he watched admiringly the easy wind-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and delivery, saw the tremendous force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of leg, stomach, and arm muscle that</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into the toss, heard the thud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pop's big mitt, and the old man's grunt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew that McClung had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">overly enthusiastic about this chap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, with the same easy motion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same apparently tremendous force,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinlan loosed a slow one. It floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, shoulder high, and Joslin fancied</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could count the seams upon the ball's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown surface, so lazily slow was it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In swift, bewildering succession fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed sharp, short, snappy curves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two spitballs that zigzagged crazily</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the ground, one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">eluding the agile mitt of the catcher</seg><seg type="columnLine">and barking his shins. Control was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinlan's middle name, even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">his first was Jack. Never, in early</seg><seg type="columnLine">season, had McClung seen such perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps, he reasoned, this brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing seemed so fine to him because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old-timers were only tossing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball about easily, limbering their pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious muscles and ligaments up grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually. He watched for a week, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Quinlan's constant improvement</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced him finally that Pop was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. A miracle had happened. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">star left-handed pitcher had dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his hands from the skies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The correspondents soon caught on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the interest he showed in young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinlan, and gave that gentleman their</seg><seg type="columnLine">undivided attention. There were col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umns written about him, the gor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geously fine news mystery of the month.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it brought no information regard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the mystery himself. Quinlan</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been born from the bowels</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth for all the news these</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers brought out. And then the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stories took new shape. The corre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spondents saw that this youngster was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only a great storv, but a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitcher as well--that he appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have won a berth with the wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">High Rollers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And all this retrospection was run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning through the manager's mind as,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tail of his eye, he studied his</seg><seg type="columnLine">find. Young, handsome as a Greek god,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentle looking and good-natured, it did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not seem possible that miserliness could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the weakness in his nature. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">some flaw there surely must be. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">man could be all that Jack Quinlan had</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed himself in the pitching line and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have some grievous fault. Joslin</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How's the whip, son?" he ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young chap's eyes brightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">affably, while a splendid smile parted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips as he rubbed his south arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelling the biceps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Getting loosened up every day," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">responded cheerily. "I don't get half</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough work, Mr. Joslin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The manager grunted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're working too hard. Run</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the park three times and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to the hotel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With slow chagrin the recruit rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trotted obediently about the ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">park. He did not shirk, allowing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, splendid legs to stretch far out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a sprinter's stride. He was cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly more than full of pepper, thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joslin, as he turned his attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other players. Still, there must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">something wrong. There must be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night at dinner the topic of</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation revolved about the annual</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball which the players gave the towns-</seg><seg type="columnLine">people for the entertainment so lav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishly showered upon them throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">their stay. It was the big event of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long Horn, and the players enjoyed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than the guests themselves. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">their name implied, the High Rollers</seg><seg type="columnLine">never did anything by halves. Not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Strange Doings of Mister Quinlan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">151</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dissipated lot of men, they still believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in enjoying themselves to the utmost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Joslin approved of most of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">sport, arguing that it kept them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">going stale, getting nervous and irri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table during the hot train rides, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain and stress of a driving season</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the diamond. He suddenly noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Quinlan's face drop as the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject of expense arose. He determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see what there was to Pop's surmise</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the afternoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hat over his eyes, he squatted in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big lobby chair after the meal, appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently dozing. In reality, his little black</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes never left the face of the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">twirler. "High Pockets" Jennings, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all men the most persuasive and good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natured, emerged from a clump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager players, notebook and pencil in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. He stopped beside the manager</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whispered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How much, Kill, for the ball? I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting you down hard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Call it a century, High," shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered the manager, ignoring his pet</seg><seg type="columnLine">infielder's warm thanks. He was watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the eager way with which Quinlan</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose from a near-by chair and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the stairs. Jennings saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">going and started in pursuit, but Jos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin's voice rang out commandingly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quinlan ! Step here a second !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hand me your book, High," he cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply to Jennings, then waited while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new pitcher approached, his jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust forward pugnaciously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quinlan," he began slowly, his tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant, but his teeth snapping down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the words in the way which all big</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaguers knew meant trouble or antic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ipated trouble, "being a new man, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably don't know of a custom we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had for the last five years of giv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a hop to the people of Long Horn '</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show our appreciation of the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tertainment and good feeling they al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways exhibit toward us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jennings is taking up a subscription</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.

If there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing for which he was noted more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than another it was the square dealings</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had with his men. No one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever complained of ill treatment from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scrappy Bill, and he had enemies by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the score--exclusive of umpires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind about that talk," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grated. "You've got money, Quinlan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I know it. I've seen you haul out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a roll of bills when you paid for your</seg><seg type="columnLine">laundry. Now, I'm trying to do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">decent thing. Do you want to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribute, to pay back for what you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">received ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I don't want to," as shortly an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered the left-hander.

By</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mighty effort of will he curbed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue. After all, he owed it to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own employers to give them his best,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to save them the thousands which this</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy would earn for them. He himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely a cog in a machine when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came to this team, and no enmity</seg><seg type="columnLine">could arise between inanimate things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jennings, who had been listening inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">estedly, started to address him, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression on Scrappy Bill's face for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bade conversation. The popular player</seg><seg type="columnLine">hustled out on the veranda to gossip</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about this astonishing conversation to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the other players, while Joslin sought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out Pop McClung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The effects of what Joslin had to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tell and what Jennings had to tell were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soon apparent. The veteran coach, who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was carried along at a good salary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">merely to coach youngsters in the finer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">art of the game and because of his mas-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terly handling of any situation involv-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing kinks in human nature, listened to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the manager gravely and nodded his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wise old head. Then he started to talk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">things over with Quinlan, hoping to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">show him how impossible it was to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">get along with his fellows, to get the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">best out of himself when the men were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">against him, should he continue to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hoard his every dollar. On the other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hand, the men began to look for traits</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of miserliness in the recruit whom they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">felt sure by now would be a regular</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">during the coming season.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The High Rollers found exactly what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">, they were looking for, and that by no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very strenuous effort. Quinlan was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mean, niggardly, a-hoarder of wealth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And to think," groaned little Josh</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Reynard, who sported more diamonds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than were ever seen before outside of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a pawnshop window, "that his first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">name is Jack, and a mistr has crept into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the High Rollers.

The High Rollers and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bears, always bitterest of rivals, clashed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over the temperament of Jack Quinlan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Royce's brilliant invective against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Strange Doings of Mister Quinlan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">153</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">meanness of the young left-hander was</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed on throughout the league. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lad been with any other organiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion than the High Rollers it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have been so bad. There were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benedicts, all married, whose wives col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected their pay envelopes; and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the Bachelors, who yearned for</seg><seg type="columnLine">married life, and hoarded against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy day; and there were the Crabs</seg><seg type="columnLine">with four notoriously stingy men</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their roster--Quinlan's disposition</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have stood out so fiamingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with any of the three. But to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a one with Joslin's spenders--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little over the limit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Quinlan was carried with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">team quite as every one had prophe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sied.

But, somehow, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood behind old Pop and watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster warm up before games, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence could not find it in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart to release him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One game--two games--three games,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Quinlan lost in rapid succession.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the last essay he faced the Bears</seg><seg type="columnLine">with nothing but a glove and a prayer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joslin nudged old McClung in the ribs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pop," he whispered, "there's noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to it.

He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand the situation and it irritated</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Already, the president of the club</seg><seg type="columnLine">was asking why in the world he carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a supine failure further, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared ho answer. Rarely, if ever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before had Mr. Collins interfered or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">questioned his judgment of a ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">player, but three games lost in a row</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a beginner had caused that gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man considerable worry about the state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Scrappy Bill's mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The evening after that third defeat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pop McClung took the left-hander off</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a corner of the lobby, his good-hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mored face very serious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quinnie," he said, "I want to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a talk with you where no one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows us can overhear.

And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">this siege went on--the siege under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken in glad memory of Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Towneley--until Jonathan began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what lack of sleep meant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleep waited for him at every turn; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw dust in his eyes when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">striving to keep eyelids open ; it tempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to lay down his courage and sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">his manhood for an hour's forgetful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. He could not yield. The judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed him, that was all. Day by day</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knowledge gained on him that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was priest and doctor both, nursing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick man back to health.

The reason was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and some ten other military con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">victs had planned one of the most dar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing prison deliveries that San Leandro</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever had to frustrate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had outside confederates, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had in some manner smuggled to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough hexagonal pierced-grain, big-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun powder from the naval station on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bay, ten miles down the estuary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to blow the whole prison to smithereens.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The plan was this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The garbage chutes open through</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoppers that hang over the estuary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under these the city garbage scows</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop on their way out to sea. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">chutes open from a platform about ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet above the prison yard, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform is approached by two ramps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clendenning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">191</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The space beneath the platform is in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed by concrete walls and is utilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the prison tool house.

At five-thirty in the evening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men from 'the furniture factory</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the yard are just forming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">march back to retreat, the two tool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house men lock their door, and Clen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denning is dumping his last cartload</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the chutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The powder was placed against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer wall of the tool house, a slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuse of twisted rags dampened with</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerosene was so to time the explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would occur when all of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups were at a safe distance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tool house. The quantity of powder</seg><seg type="columnLine">insured a breach in the river wall, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction of the caponier and gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an excellent opportunity for es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape to any of some hundred and fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">convicts who cared to make the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It worked beautifully to the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">last second.

The sentry over Clenden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning stepped aside as the iron doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut, and stood pumping the cartridges</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of his gun, while Jerry, Clenden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning slouching along beside him, ambled</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the yard, turned at the chute, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">labored up the incline.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every man was perfectly schooled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his part. The tool-house men came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, closed their door, and stepped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">position for the lock step across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard. Over in front of the furniture</seg><seg type="columnLine">factory, the long butternut brown queue</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tired convicts was forming to march</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Then the first critical incident</seg><seg type="columnLine">was passed over smoothly enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moment Clendenning sprung his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dumping lever a resounding "thump"</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded from the platform. It caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one to glance in that direction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was followed by a suppressed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">decorous murmur of laughter. The off</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel of the garbage cart had worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the axle, and now, with increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity, went spinning down the ramp</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the stables. Clendenning stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment with a look of perplexed</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupidity on his face, then glanced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grinning guard in the caponier, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">received permission to go after it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel struck and rebounded from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">concrete stabli wall, and lay rocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its hub when Clendenning reached it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The furniture gang had formed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time, and the tool-house men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">halfway across the yard. I was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only person to be struck by Clen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denning's peculiar attitude at that in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had stooped over for hi% wheel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had ceased movement, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly frozen in that position, back</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent, hand outstretched, eyes turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward from his task in a look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that I could discover to educe</seg><seg type="columnLine">such emotion was the form of Jerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">silhouetted against the evening sky, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he peered over the edge of the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form above the tool house, his hammer</seg><seg type="columnLine">head drooped dejectedly, his long ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">limply forward in a pose of deathless</seg><seg type="columnLine">sadness and_ inscrutable yearning. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">something had electrified Clendenning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dashed across the sanded prison</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard toward the tool-house door, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the guard's frightened command:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Halt!" he yelled, "Fire!" and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">clawing a moment at the latch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sure enough, a thin eddy of blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke came curling out through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening, and when I reached it I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Clendenning furiously tossing aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corded picks and shovels at the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the room, a tongue of flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">sputtering around his feet.
