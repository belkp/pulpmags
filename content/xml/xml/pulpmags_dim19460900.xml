Ramus didn't look like a professor. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like a snow bird. He was a little guy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a pointed nose and brown eyes which</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood out from his face like two half-buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">marbles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His office was one flight up in an old ram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shackle building on Rampart a couple of blocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">off Canal. The black letters on the glass panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the door read, Information on Anything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">M. Ramus. A very modest guy, the professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He always gave me a laugh. Maybe that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">' why I kept up a contact with him. He knew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ii</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">W. T.

The books occupied the room at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear and they nearly filled it, piled in huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">stacks which reached almost to the dirty ceil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. There must have been six or seven thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand, but Ramus could find the one he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a couple of minutes. He must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a card index in his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His income wasn't very good or very cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain. The library called him occasionally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the university asked him questions, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lectured once in awhile. Sometimes he bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowed money from me. I suspected that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to borrow some on the afternoon he</seg><seg type="columnLine">phoned but I was wrong. He wanted me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet a girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl gave me butterflies. She was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">blonde that her hair looked almost white in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray of afternoon' sun which crept in</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Ramus' dusty windows. Her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were blue and very dark. Her lashes dark too</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it made a startling effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She wore a shark-skin suit and she was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of person who could wear tailored clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and still look very, very like a woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I caught my breath. I like pretty women.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who doesn't?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ramus said, "This is Van Kerby, the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">detective in North America."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"The world," I told her, playing it straight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is Sue Pedarre." The little professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at her as if she'd been made of rare</seg><seg type="columnLine">porcelain, "and this is her attorney, Boyd</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henderson shook hands. He was big, fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, a well conditioned fifty which spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">of plenty of golf or maybe hand ball.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've heard of you," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I let that pass. A lot of people had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Kerby and Smith. We pride ourselves that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have the biggest agency in the south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What gives?" I was watching the girl. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked watching her. I thought I could sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for a long, long time, just looking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ramus said, "Miss Pedarre belongs to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old families. However she wasn't born</seg><seg type="columnLine">here but in California."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at the girl. The name was certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">French, but that blondness, "They raise them</seg><seg type="columnLine">nice in California," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ramus ignored me. The girl tried to. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawyer cleared his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of her ancestors," said Ramus, "was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smuggler, or a trader--a pirate perhaps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His name was Henri, Henri Pedarre. He is</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to have financed some of the Lafitte</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations, although I've never been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">connect him directly with the brothers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I waved this aside. I wasn't concerned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">history. "Well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At any rate, he was killed in the battle of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Orleans. Before he died, he told his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife that he'd buried a fortune. She never</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it although she spent her life looking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her sons never found it. The story of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure became a legend in the family."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So now Miss Pedarre is hunting the treas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure?" I started to reach for my hat which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd placed on the floor beside my chair. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wish her luck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait," said Ramus, and there was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">urgency in his voice. "She found a chart. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in an old trunk lid. It's evidently been</seg><seg type="columnLine">there since Henri Pedarre hid it after burying</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gold." He reached into his desk, drew out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piece of parchment and handed it to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took it unwillingly. Almost every old</seg><seg type="columnLine">property in the state has its own story of</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried treasure. Some of them may be true.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fact remains that not many have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at the chart. It seemed to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan of a house, or of a number of plantation</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings. Below the plan were three columns</seg><seg type="columnLine">of numbers and to the right was a silly jingle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Start at the center and turn to the right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    From Y to A and V to D,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The bishop's longest move you see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     Dropping squares at bottom and right,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   And using only those which are white,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     You have no place for the letter Z.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T READ it over twice. Then shook my head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing it back. "Sorry, I'm not good at</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzles."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ramus said, "You don't understand. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't send for you to solve this. I've already</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have?" I looked at him completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And a very simple matter." He wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bragging, merely stating a fact. "It only took</seg><seg type="columnLine">me two hours. You see, anyone familiar with</seg><seg type="columnLine">chess would spot it at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's chess got to do with it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The bishop," he explained, "is one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces used in a chess game. He moves di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agonally across the board. Therefore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bishop's longest move would be from the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand corner of the board perhaps to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right lower."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened his desk again and produced a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chess board. "You see." He drew a line with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Go on." I didn't see, but I was listening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right. Now, half the board squares</seg><seg type="columnLine">are white, half black. The rhyme says to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the white squares, and also to ignore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom row and the row to the right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, when a chess board is correctly</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed, so," he turned the board, "A is in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper white corner, Y at the other end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diagonal if we ignore the row at the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">DIG YOUR OWN MURDER!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tom and right, thus," He arranged the letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stared at the board. "Okay, if you say</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. What now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These columns of numbers." He explained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Take the first number 23335. You notice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in 110 place does a one appear. Therefore I</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured that they began counting with one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now your rhyme. The first line is, Start</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the center and turn to your right. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">started in the center of the board first. It didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. I then started in the center of the first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">line. Try it, counting the square between B</seg><seg type="columnLine">and C as one. It will come out D. I won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore you with working out each number. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cipher reads:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     "Dig ten paces from the post</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     Where the whip is used the most."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I stared doubtfully at the columns of figures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right, if you say so. But if you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved the cipher, what do you need with me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lawyer interrupted. "Frankly, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kerby, we're scared."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I turned to look at him. He didn't seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared, nor was he the type of guy who I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect to scare easily. "Scared of what?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shook his head. "We don't know. Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedarre's luggage has been searched twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">since her arrival, and she's been followed."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I grinned at the girl. "I can think of sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral reasons why she should be followed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">have nothing to do with buried treasure."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She flushed, the color coming up into her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. The lawyer made a noise in his throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was obvious that he did not appreciate</seg><seg type="columnLine">my little joke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ramus said, hurriedly, "It's simple, Van.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Pedarre wants to hire you. She's afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if she goes out to dig up the treasure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone will hi-jack it before she gets back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shrugged. "I'll send an operative. It will</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost you twenty-five dollars and expenses."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl spoke up, almost for the first time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her voice was low, yet warm and -throaty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wouldn't you go yourself? I'd feel much</seg><seg type="columnLine">safer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at her. "When does this digging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">take place?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tonight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You and his nibs?" I nodded toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawyer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't go," he said. "I've got an important</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting. If I could, I wouldn't need you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our eyes measured each other. I thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm pretty much in my own line, but to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird, I'm just another hired man. He's not</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to like me with his blonde girl, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't help himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Okay," I said. "You're hired yourself a</seg><seg type="columnLine">digging man, but just where do we dig. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhyme isn't very clear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the old slave quarters," said Ramus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where else do you think they used a whip</seg><seg type="columnLine">around there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We drove out the old river road. I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that country pretty well and I'm familiar with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old plantations. Once it was a place of</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty, of life, but that was some time back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Most of the old houses have boards at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows now, and the land has gone back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglected and uncared for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't really worried about the girl being</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed. I've found that treasure seekers are</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually given to screwy ideas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I didn't say that as we drove along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sweeping road. "How long since you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen the place?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CUE PEDARRE shook her head. "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ never seen it I inherited it from an uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of years ago. Mr. Henderson came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down once to look at it. We've been trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sell, but we haven't found a buyer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A lot of the old places are for sale, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of them have failed to find buyers. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">country isn't what it once was. It's kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty now, a little desolute, its productivity</seg><seg type="columnLine">mostly gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How'd you happen to find the cipher?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">She smiled. "That was an accident. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Henderson was down here he sold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old furniture, but he shipped several old</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunks up San Francisco. I didn't want them</seg><seg type="columnLine">so we decided the best thing to do was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">burn them. The cipher was hidden in one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lids."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Henderson there when you found it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He seems to be around most of the time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's an old family friend," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried to make something of that. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions from Ramus how to find the place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'd even told me how to park. "There's an</seg><seg type="columnLine">14	W. T.

"You can pull into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walk across the field to the slave quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters. That way, anyone following you won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the car."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I'd laughed. The idea of anyone actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">following us had struck me as funny. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did watch the rear view mirror all the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">from town. I was certain we hadn't been fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I parked the car in the lane and took up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pick and shovel I'd brought. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">setup made me feel ridiculous, but the blonde</seg><seg type="columnLine">being with me made it fun. We started across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field toward where the old house made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark outline against the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing bothers me usually, but as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked across the rough ground I had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation of ants crawling up and down my</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. Maybe it was the girl's excfltement, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was nervous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hand resting on my arm pressed hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough so that they should have been able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take her finger prints off my hide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Relax," I said. "I'm going to have to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">that arm to dig with."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of relaxing, her grip tightened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her voice had the breathless dry quality which</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be put there only by fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to look. At first I saw nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause her excitement, then I saw the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">outline of a car parked in the shadow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Someone's here," she whispered.

I felt better with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">solidness in my hand, a nice gun, a thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight on a forty-five frame with the grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">specially built to fit my hand.

Moisture came through the wall making</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stone wet and a little slippery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man was busy in a far corner. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised one of the floor stones and pulled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a metal box.

It was the first knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge he had that he was not alone.

"Take a look at your</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure, kitten," I indicated the metal box</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a jerk of my gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stared for an instant longer, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved over to the box and looked down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">its contents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's . . . it's full of money . . . there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a treasure ...

There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure all right. But no pirate had buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. The box had told me that.

They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed by Henry Morgenthau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It hurt me to tell her.

Her blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes seemed to crystallize into chips of ice, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her shoulders stiffened. "You . . . you mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're going to take it, to rob me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shrugged. After all, you couldn't blame</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. It was a natural reaction. She'd seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">me club the punk and it must have seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty ruthless. Who was I? A private de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tective, out for what I could get.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I grinned. "Look, sweet.

"Then . . . then, there isn't any treas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shrugged. "If there is, this isn't the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hunt for it. Sonny boy over there," I in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicated the unconscious man, "may have some</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends around. I can't imagine them being</seg><seg type="columnLine">this careless.

"What about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hesitated, then I' went over and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his pockets. There was nothing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all in the way of identity. I thought of tying</seg><seg type="columnLine">him up until the authorities could get there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A sound from outside decided me against it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sound had been a step.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I covered the distance to the candle in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumps and blew it out, then I whispered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl. "Over this way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her soles scraped on the stone floor in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness. I didn't like it.

If he were a guard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd be suspicious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I guessed now that he'd walked to the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the other man and was just coming back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Up the stairs," I whispered, grasping her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She almost dropped the box.

You could trust that gal to freeze onto</seg><seg type="columnLine">money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We moved quickly up the stairs. I hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could slip through the door unseen, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">our luck was running thin.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun hammered a second time, blasting sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the night. I knew the guard couldn't see</seg><seg type="columnLine">us because of the angle from which his shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. If the girl hadn't been with me, I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have circled back and tried to get him. As it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, we ran. There was a ditch a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet behind the buildings. We dived for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought of snakes, but at the moment I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was worried more about hot lead than about</seg><seg type="columnLine">venom. We made the ditch and worked our</seg><seg type="columnLine">way along it. The man back by the house was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still jumpy. Every couple of minutes he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast at something. I'm not certain what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he was shooting at. Maybe he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just exercising his'trigger finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he wasn't following and I slowed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace. The girl was panting and I took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box from her. "Relax, kitten, we're out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She gave a little gasping laugh. "I'm afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm not up to treasure hunting, Kerby. I al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most died when those bullets started flying."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We both almost died," I said soberly. "For</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting in the dark, that bozo was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">close."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She squeezed my arm.

"Somehow, I feel pretty safe when I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was very close, and very nice. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sudden impulse to kiss her. Instead I</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeezed her arm.

It was rough going and she almost fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice. I was trying to help her. I was care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less I guess. I never saw them until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were close to the car then.

I grabbed his knees and jerked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet out from under him. He went down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second man swung at my head. I rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, coming up to my feet, jerkingjny gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•	I couldn't see the girl.

They must have hunted for ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, but they were worried about some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Finally the car lights cut on.

"Look, Ramus, there's some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing screwy about this deal.

Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">time an old scrap of newspaper blew out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an alley mouth, I almost cut and ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I'm not very big--something close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">average size, I guess.

I stopped in front of the Crosset Jewelry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Store and lit a cigarette. The dark window</seg><seg type="columnLine">pane made a mirror for the street behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and I looked at that until the match</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned my fingers.

When I fired questions at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him he'd just grin and shake his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stopped in front of a big old stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">house in a quiet neighborhood, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chauffeur followed me up the steps and rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bell. The door was opened by a quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">little man about fifty or sixty. He had bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes behind steel-rimmed glasses, gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair brushed back in a smooth wave, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes that must've cost as much as I make'</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a month. There was a girl in the hallway</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him, and she was--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was terrific. She had red-gold hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the length I like, down to her shoulders on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side, and a kind of page-boy deal in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. There wasn't too much curl--the hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like a burnished helmet on her head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Diana Artemis. You learn stuff like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in architect school. But she was terrific.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She smiled at me, and I came back with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon-faced grin. I hadn't seen so pretty a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl in all my life, I was sure of that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had on a light green wool sport suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made her figure something to dream</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. She stood by the door to the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, doing nothing but smile at me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old guy took me by the arm and led me</seg><seg type="columnLine">past her. The driver of the car followed us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slouched down with one shining boot</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocked carelessly over a chair arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old guy wasted no time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My name is Joseph Grieve," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"cttid these are my associates, whom you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see again if you are wise.

I looked back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little gray-haired man who called himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joseph Grieve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps I should explain more fully,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man said.

I went back to the office and turned out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plans for the Forbes store, and they went</seg><seg type="columnLine">off pretty well.

And there was only one guy I could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">think of who might go to bat for me.

"What seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be indicated," he said, "is some kind of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap where you'd be able to make a record</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their voices.

And there was a grimness about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth that made him look like he meant it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T BEGAN to cheer up a little. It looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd picked a pretty good guy to help me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And desperate as the chance was, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than sitting around waiting for a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den and violent death from some unexpected</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How soon can we do it?"

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she washed while I dried, getting through</seg><seg type="columnLine">first and apologizing for leaving me to finish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe it hasn't been much a day for you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said.

It hadn't, but I did find out one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing: That drawer didn't contain a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting instrument worth the name. Just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple old paring knives, so dull and worn that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd have bent double if you tried to force</seg><seg type="columnLine">them through anything more solid than a head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cabbage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could feel the skin tightening across my</seg><seg type="columnLine">scalp. Apparently there was more than one</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason why Timothy Beaumont kept those nice</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp steak knives under lock and key!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that, I went up the stairs and knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to talk to you, Ellen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm in bed.

I tried the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it locked. "Your brother gave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">specific instructions about those steak knives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want him to find all six in the drawer when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he comes home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know what you're talking about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Go away now and stop bothering me, or I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to report you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So she'd have to report me! She, who less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than six hours ago had practically been on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her knees, begging me to stay!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ellen," I said tightly. "I want that knife!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ye gods--you've got knives on the brain!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that this afternoon! Why don't you go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through your own pockets? . . ." Her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">softened a little. "I'm sorry, Steve.

You'll find</seg><seg type="columnLine">a key, flashlight and clean blankets in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">closet at the end of the hall. That knife must</seg><seg type="columnLine">still be in the kitchen some place. We'll look</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it again in the morning. . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR awhile, I was willing to believe her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To believe that maybe Tim had taken the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife, hoping to throw suspicion on her--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. But after I'd settled myself in the creak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bed in the carriage house loft, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to think about it some more, I knew she'</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I knew something else: That I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to get mixed up in a thing like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. I tried to tell myself that this was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">good a way to spend a couple of weeks as any.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That the bed was soft, and the food passable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if I stuck it out till I'd accumulated a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little stake in my jeans, the going would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier when I hit the road again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I could feel the old compulsion build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up inside me; the compulsion to be on my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">way, no matter where. And the fact remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">that anyone who didn't have to, would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy to stay around a place where knives</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared as soon as they were taken from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their locked drawers for a minute. Brother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was just asking for it 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, it took me almost two hours of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of thinking to get me out of bed and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my clothes again. Because through it all I</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept remembering the way she'd looked that</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon, and the way her voice had sounded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleading for the help she thought I could give</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. And she needed help, I knew that, now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Regardless of who had taken the knife, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed help. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few yards beyond the carriage house</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, I paused for a last look at her window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was dark. An early moon rode above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad cut to the north, and in its diffused</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow the rot and decadence of the place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed away. The house stood big and white</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the night, with only a few vaguely</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker patches to show where the siding</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed paint, and the roof, new shingles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The weeds in the neglected garden plot</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been flowers about to bloom; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rolling acreage beyond, a pasture where</seg><seg type="columnLine">trim young Morgans frolicked, waiting to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken to the saddle. In the moonlight the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole place looked like the haven of stately</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignified good living it once had been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it didn't tempt me much. I'd seen it</seg><seg type="columnLine">by daylight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Skirting the trees to the point where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path dead-ended against the far side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence, I had to pass by the pool again. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface glistened like black glass beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, and I remembered how good that cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring water had felt that afternoon. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time of night when the world is supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be cooling off, but that wheat country heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't lifted an inch since noon, and pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon I was pulling off my clothes again, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a last dip before I went over the fence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I'd been splashing around for about ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, when I heard someone coming across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pasture, moving fast and kind of panting</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. I turned in the water to face the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound, and pretty soon there he was, Timothy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beaumont, silhouetted on top of the knoll. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">long thin arms and legs moved with a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of jerky tension, like a badly-manipulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">marionette; his tongue was caught hard be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween his teeth, and his face was as white as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skull of one long dead. His fingers opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closed spasmodically on the butt of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">12-gauge pump gun in his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before I could yell at him to take it easy, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught sight of my face bobbing in the water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the gun barrel levelled off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I submerged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> None too soon. The sound of the gun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">42</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KEN LEWIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a hollow ringing in the water, and I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost feel the shot slapping against the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face above my head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I scissored into the shadows of the rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge where he stood, before I came up for</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't shoot," I gasped. "I was leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The water interfered with his sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction. I could see him almost directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">above me, searching the far bank with fren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zied eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who--who is it?'' he croaked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steve Lang. The man you hired this</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon. I just came down for a midnight</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge. "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My God! My God--don't ever do that</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. I--I thought it was prowlers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He collapsed on the ledge, his face slack</seg><seg type="columnLine">with relief, too spent to think of helping me</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You look like you might have thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a ghost," I said drily, hunkering down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the grass beside him. "How'd you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone was down here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The fence. I heard you when you touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fence. It's wired to a buzzer in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. . . We've been having trouble with</seg><seg type="columnLine">prowlers lately. I haven't had a full night's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep in weeks. But I've never been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch them at it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nuts.

I--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it's some of the youngsters from town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to sneak in here for a swim. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">water's too cold for that. I'm afraid they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might drown. That's why I put up the fence</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the first place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," I pointed out, "filling them full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead's indeed a very poor way to insure their</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried to laugh.

"How</seg><seg type="columnLine">long has it been since those trees were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pruned? Probably a branch has grown so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it scrapes the fence when the breeze is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">right. I'll try to locate it and cut it off to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mor-ww."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head weakly.

Look, old man, I'm afraid you'd better</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stay here, after all. There's something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Ellen you don't know. "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could feel the sack coming, and all at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once an unreasoning stubbornness possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Half an hour ago I'd been all ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">call it quits and leave. Now I felt just as ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinate about being kicked out.

And for the time, I prefer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remain icognito where she's concerned."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was eyeing me more closely now. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you getting at?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I grinned apologetically. "The fact that I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">really Doctor Stephen Langley of California.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My old friend, Dr. Welsh, sent me here.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">held out his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By God, Doc," he breathed, "I'm glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're here. Frankly, I--I haven't been too</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied with Ellen's condition lately. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be all right when she first came</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. But during the past few weeks she--■</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, I'm afraid she's slipping back again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded. "Small wonder, cloistered away</seg><seg type="columnLine">here with no outside contacts. She needs</seg><seg type="columnLine">people around her, friends, something to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mind off herself. Have you tried to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything about that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded ruefully. "Yes, I tried. I plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ned a surprise homecoming party for her, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night she came back. Not a soul showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. . . I guess you don't know much about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people in these little back-country towns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE POOL OF FEAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Doc. They're still pretty medieval when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes to things like nervous disorders.

Again his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowed. "I supposed you were familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her case history."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook my head. "I follow rather eccen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric methods, Beaumont. I prefer to go into</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things cold, with no preconceived diag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noses to throw me off the scent. . . Tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. When did she first begin to Show</seg><seg type="columnLine">symptoms of emotional instability?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked away. "She was always a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the high-strung, nervous side," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But nothing serious ever happened till the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night Jeremy Richards jilted her,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right--let's have it. What sort of guy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was this Richards?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shrugged. "Oh, he seemed to be a nice</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough lad. He delivered groceries here;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's how they met. They fell in love and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to elope. His folks didn't want him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry, and she had some silly notion that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't aprove, either. . . . But we've always</seg><seg type="columnLine">been rather close to each other, especially since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man died. So a day or so before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheduled elopement she broke down and told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me all about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I won't pretend to have been overjoyed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were only nineteen at the time, and--</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, young Richards wasn't exactly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beaumont social circle. But she'd made up her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, and after all, that was all that mattered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hope I have more sense than to try to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">any girl whom to fall in love with--especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own sister. . . . But I pointed out that an</seg><seg type="columnLine">elopement would be foolish; they could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">married right here in her own home. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tickled to death, but afraid Jerry might not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like it, if he found out. So we decided to sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She would go down to meet him when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up the path from the tracks, as original-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly planned. Then I would step out of the trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving my shotgun, and marshal them up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house, where the minister and wedding</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests would be waiting. The whole thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">would just be a big gag. I'm afraid it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather crude, but you know the sort of thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smart young set in any town thinks is</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny." He paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I take it Jeremy didn't show up for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the party?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He didn't show up. Of course, it's obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">what happened. They had been putting too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much pressure on him at home--probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening him with an annulment if he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with it--and he couldn't take it. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he couldn't stand to break the news to Ellen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either. So he lit out And he hasn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard from since."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">«QIIE cracked up that night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ^ He nodded heavily. "We left the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, with the guests sitting around in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark and giggling at my prop shotgun. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up a position at the top of the path,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there wasn't any fence then, and I hid back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees, where I could watch her and time</seg><seg type="columnLine">my entrance. I could see her tightening up, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the minutes dragged by and no one showed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tracks below. And finally she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysterics and collapsed, and I had to carry her</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the house and put her to bed; to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guests they could go on home now, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there'd be no wedding at the Beaumont men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age that night." His jaw tightened. "It wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a week till they had to come and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take her away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was shaking all over now with the strain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reliving it. I put a hand on his arm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped him up. On the way back to the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he suggested that I move into the room across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hall from hers, where I could observe her</seg><seg type="columnLine">better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll tell her the gardener's room's unten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able--rats or something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waited outside the carriage house while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went in and picked up my bed-roll. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we entered the house together and walked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the second floor hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His room was the first to the right of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs. The door was open, and as he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it, I saw something gleam in the shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">of moonlight across the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The something was an ivory-hafted steak</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife, held in the hand of Ellen Beaumont.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A S MY eyes adjusted to the gloom, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see her in there, standing by his bed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her nightgown. She was facing us, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was as blank as a sleeping baby's. All but</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes. They held a kind of dull sickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they fastened on him, and her fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures convulsed in an expression of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning and implacable hatred I've ever seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The knife came up, and she began to advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly toward us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stumbled back, his face as white as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been down by the pool. "Oh, God--" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked. "Throw the blankets at her. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">something." His fingers began to scrabble</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the wall, hunting the light switch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I forced them down. "She's somnambulant,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I hissed. "A sudden shock right now might</seg><seg type="columnLine">force her into a crisis from which she'd never</seg><seg type="columnLine">recover! Get back in the hall--out of sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Go get her a sedative, if there's any in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Th-there's nembutal," he whispered, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me.

But for God's sake, stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of her sight! Wait in the kitchen. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I could hear him stumbling down the steps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">behind me. I was watching her. She had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stopped moving when he disappeared from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">room, and now her eyes were as black as be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fore. But the knife was still lifted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I remained perfecdy motionless. "Hello,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ellen," I said softly, as though I was talking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">te a sleeping child. "I'm glad you found the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knife. Now we can put it back in the drawer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">downstairs, before Tim comes home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Timm--?" The words were thick, slurred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Timm--not home?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not yet," I crooned. "We'll have time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to put the knife back where it belongs, before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he gets here.

"All--all right,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Stevie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I stepped forward slowly and took her arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The one with the knife. I let my fingers rest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gently on her elbow; but all the way down-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stairs I was ready to tighten that grip like a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vise if the need arose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The drawer of the china closet was still</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ajar.

"Drink it, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then we'll go to bed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She swallowed it like an obedient five-year-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">| old.

I want to be with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I walked her over to an old-fashioned love</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seat in the corner. She didn't seem to want to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">talk, so we just sat there. Pretty soon her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">arms slid arour&gt;d my neck and she kissed me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I kissed back.

That's why it's sometimes used in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">childbirth now.

Couldn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember, the next day. The doctors at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">san put it down as amnesia accompanying</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotional shock.

But so am I.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You could take his place--completely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was very hard for me to remember the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper relationship between doctor and patient</seg><seg type="columnLine">at moments like this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T DON'T know exactly when it was that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely decided on hypnosis. Sometime</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next day, I think. I knew the danger of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying it this early in the treatment; that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might fail completely, and make the final solu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that much harder. But the old restless</seg><seg type="columnLine">compulsion was on me again, and I knew, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the more time I spent with Ellen Beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mont, the harder it would be for me to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">goodbye when the time did come. Then, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was always the danger that Tim might some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how find out my true status here and kick me</seg><seg type="columnLine">out forthwith, thus ending the treatment right</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I explained all this to her, leaving out my</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal feelings, of course, and she agreed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She'd undergone it before, at the hospital,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without too much succe.ss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So I took her up to the gardener's room in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the carriage loft, on one of those warm lazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoons, and had her stretch out on the bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her sunsuit and get comfortable. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled all the shades down tight, and carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">punched a tiny hole in one, so that a "stiletto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin blade of sunlight pinpointed the low table-</seg><seg type="columnLine">top beside her head, where her eyes could rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it naturally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After that, I assembled my razor and cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the spot with its flanged end, till a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickering bead of light danced there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-quarter darkness. I told her to concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trate on that glow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She reacted beautifully. It was no trick at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all to put her under.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You know what hypnosis is, of course:</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely an induced sleep in which the subject's</seg><seg type="columnLine">subconscious remains in contact with the prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titioner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All it takes on the part of the patient is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability to relax completely, plus an implicit</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith and confidence in the doctor. What it</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes on the part of the doctor is something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a profesrrpnal secret, dangerous in the hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the untra. ed, which we won't go into here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I judged that she had reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper state, 1 began to question her slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and softly. It was a difficult, exhausting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">complex process, trying to dredge up those se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crets which the tortured mind had striven so</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantically to force down into oblivion. But at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last I decided I'd achieved the maximum pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible results. One of the things I took especial</seg><seg type="columnLine">note of was the complete description she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to give to me, of the way Jeremy Rich-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ards had been dressed on the night he dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T)ONE, I broke contact, and decided to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sleep it off normally.

His thin face dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened with fury, and his eyes became danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous pinpoints of red-brown light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This does it, Langley!" he said thickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're through 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I pushed him roughly out the door, closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it behind me, and sidewheeled him down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Shut up!" I hissed. "You'll wake her!

On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way back down, I slipped into his room for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute and examined the shotgun he kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the bed there. Its magazine contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">five shells. I pumped them out, removed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper wadding at their ends, and poured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot from each into my pocket. Then I refilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the casings with strips torn from my pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">handkerchief, tamping the cloth down tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the powder charges, and Replaced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waddings at their ends. After that, I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inserted the shells in the magazine and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun where it had been before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If death paid a visit here tonight--and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had an uncanny feeling that it might--then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to make sure that it didn't effect its</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance by means of that gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Timothy Beaumont was still sitting by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone when I came downstairs, his pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">face suffused, his sandy hair rumpled. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us spoke as I swung through the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the drive to the gates out front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	* *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forthwith, I paid my first visit to the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Midvale. I still had fourteen dollars in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket, residue of five days work in the harvest</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields the week before, and I found a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">second-hand clothing store on the wrong side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tracks, where I acquired a skimpy two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece suit, and a cheap Panama hat, sweat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained beyond redemption, but which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably still get by at a distance, by moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. I was even able to pick up a small jar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of luminous greasepaint at a novelty shop in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vicinity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that, I spent the early ev«;ng at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearby pool room. But as soon as it oegan to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get reasonably dark, I headed back up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks toward the Beaumont place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Darkness was almost complete when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the steep narrow path winding up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the bluff there. With the aid of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror from my comb case, I dabbed some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the luminous paint on my face and hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">highlighting the hollows around my eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and making my fingers look longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">rtnd thinner than they were. Not too much--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't want to give the effect of a Hallowe'en</seg><seg type="columnLine">masquerade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I climbed the path, using the same post</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd used before to get over the fence without</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching it. On the far side, I moved through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees for a final reconnaissance before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">giving the signal which would bring Tim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beaurrftint down here on the run, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devil himself were after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T UCK was with me. The setting that night</seg><seg type="columnLine">was perfect for my experiment. A thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">new moon rode the sky, tossing a single star</seg><seg type="columnLine">between her horns, and some change in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere presaging storm had wreathed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool in wispy pockets of mist, which reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to finger the boles of the nearest trees. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole place was like some shadowy druid</seg><seg type="columnLine">glen, with the rise and fall of cicada songs for</seg><seg type="columnLine">chorus, and fireflies darting their yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">torches through the miasma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I paused a moment, selecting a hiding place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then returned to the fence and pummelled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top wire hard with my hat. I didn't want him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think it was just some stray branch dipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the breeze this time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thirty seconds of that, and I went back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pool. I crouched immobile at its edge, hid</seg><seg type="columnLine">my faintly glowing face and hands with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat sleeves, and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't two minutes till I heard him com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing across the meadow, sliding and blowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. He came to a stop on my side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knoll and swung the shotgun in a frenzied arc,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting for something to shoot it at.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I pushed my hands up out of the mist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started toward him, as though I'd come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the depths of the pool itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He screamed, and fired his first shot. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice had a hoarse, animal timbre:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go back! Go back, Jeremy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I kept coming, not making a sound" with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands hung out like hooks before me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began to back away into the trees, stum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling and firing as he went. When we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than ten yards apart, the hammer clicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead on the empty chamber, and a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gagging came from his chest. He flung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun at my head and dived for the fence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was up and over it like a monkey. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then one of his ankles touched that hot wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the top, and he screamed and plunged head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long into space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I doubt if he even heard the outbound</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight rolling through the railroad cut be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. I hadn't counted on that, myself. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result was inevitable, anyway. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have survived that thirty-foot drop to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tracks, or the hangman's noose that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have awaited him later, if he had by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle managed to pull through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it was, he went rolling and tumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the bluff like a sawdust doll, and disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared beneath the wheels of the last gondola.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The train crew probably never even knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stood there staring through the fence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the red lights of the caboose disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared around the bend, and I could feel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE POOL OF FEAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">recurrent tremors shaking me.

I'm so glad you're back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Does Tim know "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I let mv fingers close about her hand.

And he wouldn't have fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that phony apparition which rose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mists to confront him there last night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Subconsciously, from the moment of the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, he lived in mortal terror that some day</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead would rise to haunt him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how--how could you know?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was mostly a shot in the dark," I admit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted. "But it hit the target. But I learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough from you under hypnosis, to fill in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanks. It was your description of the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeremy was dressed that night, that cued my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own disguise. . . . From the moment you told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in a burst of sisterly confidence that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned to marry Jeremy, he must have begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">to plot Jeremy's death.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew you were too proud to try to get in touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">with your former friends."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her eyes were Wide and dark with shock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But how--how could he kill Jeremy?"^.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you mean the mechanics of it, that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple. He talked you into holding the wed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding here, and proposed that gag with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shotgun. But when Jeremy met you at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of the path, Tim didn't merely emerge</seg><seg type="columnLine">from hiding and use the gun to marshal you</seg><seg type="columnLine">both to the house. Instead, he used it to strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry over the head, killing him. And later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you in bed under sedatives and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests gone home, he went back and weighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body with rocks and dumped it into the al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most bottomless quarry hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I--I've known all this, all along?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I nodded. "A little part of you knew it. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a very small part, buried deep in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden substrata of your mind. And it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conflict between this subconscious knowledge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the secret hate it made you feel for Tin-,</seg><seg type="columnLine">set against your conscious image of him as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loyal and devoted brother who deserved your</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmest affection, that has caused all your</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. ... You see, darling, you're really</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of very tough emotional fibre. Other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise, that conflict would have torn you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces long ago. As it was, it found expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">only in your dream activity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her head moved rebelliously on the pillow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I couldn't forget a thing like Jeremy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder! Nothing could ever make me!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," I said. "There is one thing. It lies</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your reaction to a certain drug. There are</seg><seg type="columnLine">some persons whom this drug, normally a sed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ative, does not put to sleep at once. Instead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they apparently remain conscious, even lucid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a degree. But the drug aflects their memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">centers so that later, after it has worn off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they can't consciously remember a thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened while it was in effect. . . . Tim had</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed your reaction to it, earlier. Probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was given you as a sedative when your fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther died. So he gave you a dose, in a drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">or something, before you left the house to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether that night. Later, your temporary am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesia could be explained as the result of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">traumatic shock brought about by your dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointment at Jeremy's failure to appear."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her eyes were alive now, bright with re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief.

"Kiss me, Steve."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could feel the blood pounding through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">temples, but I shook my head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said shortly. "I'm still your doctor."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And what's to become of me, Doctor?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you're smart, you'll take a nice long</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip and forget all this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked away.

He was worried, yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldn't be really. According to pa, Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deak went off one time twenty years ago for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day and stayed ten years. Sandy guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was back ".hen his uncle was fat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">husky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pa had already gone to the filling station.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sandy looked for the time but the old clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stopped and Pa's watch, which he most</seg><seg type="columnLine">always left at home, was lost somewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Creeps," he growled. Uncle Deak not</seg><seg type="columnLine">being back meant he'd have to dig the worms</seg><seg type="columnLine">another day. He almost wished the fishermen</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Lakewood would lay down their poles</seg><seg type="columnLine">for good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Garbed in his checked shirt, blue jeans</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Stetson hat that pa gave him on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventeenth birthday, he meandered down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tool shed. He removed the orders from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hook, got a lifting fork and an armful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper cartons like those that chili comes in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went to number six bed on the far end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The worms there, unmolested for a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be fattest and besides, the earth was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoved up, loose, as if the bed had recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">been worked over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sandy looked off through the trees toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake. He could see the top of the mast</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Mr. Townsend's yacht and hear the cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bathers. Sandy guessed it was nice to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have plenty of money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started digging, one forkful at a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then removing the fat, wriggling worms</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the pungent earth and placing them</seg><seg type="columnLine">carejjjrUy in the cartons. Consulting his or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders- which people called in to Pa at the fill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing station, he counted the appropriate num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber into each carton before dropping moss</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside for the wriggling creatures to feed on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Creeps," he cried--the deeper he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fatter the worms became. He remained in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one spot till his fork hit something solid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first he thought he'd hit the copper wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">which served as a bottom for the bed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept the worms from escaping, but then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned down, and it wasn't the bottom at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Golly!" He rammed the fork down again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pried up. And then he went cold all over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The object under his fork was a man's bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg. Sandy turned white. He caught his</seg><seg type="columnLine">By KEN KESSLER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">breath before resolutely digging the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the recumbent form.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uncle Deak!" he cried. Already decom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">position had blurred the thin features, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shaggy grey head, the narrow eyes, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lobeless ears were familiar. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole the size of a dime in his temple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sandy dropped the fork and Jin for Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Morton's house, a quarter mile up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, where there was a phone. Black John</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sitting in the yard. "I found Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deak's body in the worm bed!" he shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black John stiffened, rising at once. Sandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed on into the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deesie Morton was washing dishes. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had on a print dress and her yellow hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which just missed matching Sandy's, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done in a knot that didn't seem too sure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself. "Lernrne use tHfe phone 1 " Sandy cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deesie almost dropped a dish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Sandy! What's the--?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Sandy was cranking the phone. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the party line operator for the sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, and then called pa. Pa hollered, "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">God!" and the receiver crashed down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who--killed him, Sandy?" Deesie burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know." And then he remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">how Uncle Deak looked. "And you stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. It's no place for kids, anyway girls."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop calling me a child," Deesie snapped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm sixteen. Some girls marry no older'n</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sandy didn't feel up to arguing with women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he let her follow him. Black John was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already on the scene. Black John was Deesie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pa, and as peculiar a man as Sandy ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw. He was forever glum, and mean looking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He and Deesie had lived alone since her ma</seg><seg type="columnLine">died. Black John was retired. He used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in the real estate and insurance business</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Lakewood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the sheriff arrived, and by the magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought by the party line operator an assem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blage of Lakewood citizenry got there almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as fast as Pa, who puffed up in the old jalopy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cox Bann, the sheriff, nodded to Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">John and gazed a long time at the body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Guess that's what you'd call a man's sins</seg><seg type="columnLine">catching up with him." Cox was round,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubby, and grey bearded but his eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise and cool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pa bristled. "Deak wasn't no model. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he was my brother." He gazed levelly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cox. "The law'd ought to learn to hold its</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TTHAT'S how pa was, Sandy thought--loyal</seg><seg type="columnLine">-*■ and good. Pa was the finest man he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">anywhere. And he was touchy about Deak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had a love for him that Sandy never un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood. He'd admit that Deak was wild,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even at fifty, and he once said to Sandy that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his uncle would end up bad yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When'd you last see him?" asked Bann,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking around at the two deputies and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">somber little coroner wlu-had just arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, er--two weeks ago," said pa. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of his brother's body upset him, Sandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed. "Me and Sandy went upstate for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week, visitin'. When we come back Deak</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now twenty or thirty people had assem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled, among them Claude Gray, a Lakewood</seg><seg type="columnLine">attorney that Uncle Deak went to see once</seg><seg type="columnLine">or twice. Sandy never knew what business</seg><seg type="columnLine">his uncle had with Gray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Gray addressing nobody in particular said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It might be of interest to note that Deak</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham left Harve quite a sum of money."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pa's eyes popped. "Deak . . . left me . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">money?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Approximately twenty thousand dollars,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gray said, folding his hands so that his mani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cure showed. "I was his lawyer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twenty thousand--!" Pa made a funny</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound with his lips. "You must be off your</seg><seg type="columnLine">nut. Deak never had twenty dollars."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about his profits from the worm</seg><seg type="columnLine">business?" Black John put in hoarsely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He had more worms than business," pa</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped. This questioning was making him</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad. "Deak come and went, I admit. Last</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he rolled in broke, 'bout a year ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He got the idea of selling fishing worms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not ordinary worms, but 'lumbrious terrestris</seg><seg type="columnLine">specie,' he called 'em. Fat worms anyway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So he drawed up blue prints for the beds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I let him use the land." After that long</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech Pa shut up tight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bann stepped across the concrete border</seg><seg type="columnLine">around bed number five. "Come off it, Harve.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tellin' us you don't know nothing about Deak</seg><seg type="columnLine">having that much money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't," pa snapped, reddening under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stare of the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Young Sandy never knew, when he dug for fishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">worms and turned Ufa instead, Uncle Deak's murdered</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, that one good corpse deserves another!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KEN KESSLER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of the rich folks from the lake club</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode up, gawking like anybody. Among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was H. Phillip Townsend, owner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yacht Marilynn which was named after</seg><seg type="columnLine">his daughter. He wore white pants, blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat, yachting cap. He nodded to the sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pa, and looked very surprised when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wondered what had happened to him,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Townsend said. "He's been selling me</seg><seg type="columnLine">bait and I need some now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff then asked both Mr. Townsend</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Black John of they'd seen anything pecu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liar going on around the Graham's property</seg><seg type="columnLine">lately. They both said no. "It looks to me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bann said, "as if Deak was shot at night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried under cover of darkness here in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worm bed--the idea being the worms would</seg><seg type="columnLine">consume the body.

"I helped him draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the map," Deesie said, because I took drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in school, but I never saw that on there."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What?

"It wasn't mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he can't tell about a decomposing</seg><seg type="columnLine">body.

Pa was sitting on the edge of the bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">cot, his chin down, his face sort of gray. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">made himself smile when Sandy handed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cigars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sandy said, "I've been going through Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deak's room--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pa got purple in the face.

At length his eyes softened. "Mebbe</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're right, son." He took a breath. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Deak come back I was in his room one</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. I run onto a copy of a police record</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden in his grip. Some man named Harry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tolbert was wanted for killing a wealthy oil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man near San Francisco. He got away, ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to the record, and after the wife col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected her share of the estate she disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. The police are looking for both parties."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pa gazed off. "You know who I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry Tolbert was?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sandy shook his head. He'd never seen pa</seg><seg type="columnLine">so solemn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uncle Deak, or one of his cronies, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a changed name.

Sandy slipped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">before pa could make him promise anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Darkness had settled down when Sandy got</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. He saw a light on in Deesie's room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rest of the Morton house was dark. Sandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered where Black John was. Deesie</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be afraid alone however. When she</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sandy used to play pirates, Deesie'd make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a canoe landii?--only it was a frigate to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and come clear through the woods at night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A big affair was going on at the lake. Sandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a log burning and heard music. He kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of pa--maybe in the electric chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to banish the thought he strolled down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water. The rich folks were dancing on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pier, sleek gowned women and men in dinner</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> H. Phillip Townsend was on the rim of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group, leaning against a tree. He was wearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white coat, dark pants, and white gloves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sandy tried to imagine what pa or Black John</seg><seg type="columnLine">would look like wearing fancy gloves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Townsend jumped when Sandy went over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You startled me," he said. "I'm sorry about</seg><seg type="columnLine">your uncle, and the unfortunate circumstances</seg><seg type="columnLine">that brought on your father's arrest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It wasn't your fault, really," Sandy said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">digging his toe in the soft earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Murder is serious. If your father isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">guilty, he'll be exonerated at a fair trial.

"No</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter what happens, pa didn't do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The music ended and the dancers strolled off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pier. Townsend's eyes followed them. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss your unce. Bought bait from him, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. Talked a lot about his worms being tne</seg><seg type="columnLine">best in the country." He chuckled. "Which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I doubted. His worms were like himself, fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lazy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A SLIM girl about Sandy's age, in a dress</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut lower than Sandy had ever seen be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, joined them. "My daughter, Marilynn,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Townsend said, and with a wink at Sandy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've heard about you," Marilynn said. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark hair was upswept and her lips deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson. "You're the worms man's nephew."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncomfortably, Sandy said, "Yes'm."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, I hate your old worms. I hate it</seg><seg type="columnLine">here." The firelight cast shadows on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your ma and pa like it," Sandy reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KEN KESSLER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mothex- doesn't.

I could like you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sandy flushed. "I--I got to go," he stam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered. "G-good night." He was twenty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">away when he heard her giggle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Sandy was very thoughtful as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">strolled back to the house. It startled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he saw a shadow ahead. He slipped be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind some tall brambles, waiting breathlessly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally the shadow moved on, and he recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized Black John. He watched as the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">threaded toward his house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When finally he flung himself across the bed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully dressed except for his shoes, it was late.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he couldn't sleep. All the factors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">present, he realized vaguely, but he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">put them together somehow. And then he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to thinking about pa in jail, alone. Then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision of Uncle Deak's body returned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sandy shivered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It scared him when he heard a scraping</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound in the vicinity of Unlle Deak's room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He jerked upright. The sound came again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eerily. He'd never thought much about ghosts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now he wasn't so sure. Covered with net-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tles, he eased off the bed and bare-footed, pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ded through the living room toward the sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was almost there when he bumped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stool. He leaped back, the unexpected fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening him. It took a lot of nerve but he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on and flung the door open, snapping on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room was silent but one window was</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, mute evidence that somebody, not a ghost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been there. The curtains stirred weirdly</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the outside breeze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sandy brushed a hand through his yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair, fighting down an impulse to clear out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then his eye rested on the blue print on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, on the X on number four bed that Deesie</seg><seg type="columnLine">had pointed out. Now that things were tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing shape in his mind, the X came to mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">something. Just what, Sandy wasn't sure, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was having an idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bolstering his nerve, he went for a flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">light and then slipped out into the night. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't turn on the light however. He crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the ground to the tool shed, where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">groped for a spade. Still crawling, dragging</seg><seg type="columnLine">the implement, he worked his way to number</seg><seg type="columnLine">four bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a moonless night but the sky was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear. The mounded earth where Uncle Deak's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body had been excavated was ominously near</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Sandy lay on his belly and dug. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only guess at the exact location of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">X on the map, but it looked about two feet out</seg><seg type="columnLine">frotfi the northeast corner. The spade crunched</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the damp earth. Worms crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Sandy's bare feet--cold, slimey crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures. He had the feeling that somebody was</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching him. His spine tingled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dug down about eighteen inches before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spade touched metal. The screech of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilled him. Exploring with his fingers, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the top of a box. -He used his fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a fork and dug the earth away. The box</seg><seg type="columnLine">was metal, the kind a mechanic uses for carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing tools. He lifted it out. The lid was sealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with wax to keep out moisture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deserting the spade, Sandy crawled back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tool shed with the box in tow. The feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that unseen eyes were following him per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted. He gained the shed, squatted in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the door and, reaching a screwdriver off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rack inside, pried away the wax. The lid</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, he removed an oilskin cloth which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped around a heavy object. Beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oilskin was a chamois. Sandy's eyes popped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncovered, the object was a gleaming .38</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver! Sandy rewrapped it carefully and</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned it to the box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly a hign, tortured scream penetrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stillness. Deesie's voice! Sandy flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself down. A blast of flame blinded him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sandy lay there, listening, not breathing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thudding footfalls retreated across the yard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That would be Deesie, but where was his as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailant ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sandy's heart pounded. Indian-style, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled on his belly around the shack. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly he could see the shadow of a figure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealthily advancing toward the shed. It struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sandy that the mail figured he'd hit him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sandy wished he dared use the .38, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was out. The gun meant something that han-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dling might obliterate. He edged farther, drag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging in the dirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. The shadow came nearer but still Sandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't see who it was, although he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty sure he knew. Moreover, he knew why</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was who it was--all useless information, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't live to use it to free pa. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was desperate or else he'd have run when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deesie screamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I reckon he knows Deesie wasn't close</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to see him good," Sandy thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly. Whivh meant the killer was free to</seg><seg type="columnLine">finish the job/'T andy figured now he'd have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done better to hang onto the revolver, evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence or not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TTHE figure neared the shed doo.\ Sandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered rising, running, but even in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness it was a big gamble if the man gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuit. So he waited, a plan forming in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. When the figure stooped over the metal .</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, Sandy leaped up. He charged the shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORM IN THE ROOT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man heard him, straightened abruptly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, you little--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Driving hard, Sandy hi* &gt;he door before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man could fire.

Sandy slammed the door, swiftly insert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the lock in the hasp. There was wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursing within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Frame pa, will ya?" Sandy cried triumph-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antly. Just then a shot ripped through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Sandy spun, falling backwards. A tin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling besieged his shoulder. He touched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh. Blood on his hand, warm, sticky. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fighting back nausea when another shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">from within the shed blasted loose the hasp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door was swinging outward as Sandy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">losing his fight, swam away on the wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">soaring wings of the metal box, just outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sheriff Bann, Deesie, Black John and H.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phillip Townsend were in the room.

"I--I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just going to call you--" he blinked, choking</seg><seg type="columnLine">--"No, he was escaping out the door!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Deesie called me," said the sheriff. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't escape. Black John had a change of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart He finally did somebody a good turn."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Black John did?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was Deesie's doin's," said Black John</seg><seg type="columnLine">grudgingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deesie touched the bed. "He'd been out</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking down by the lake.

"Now he's going to stop being so</seg><seg type="columnLine">grouchy and selfish. He promised me just</seg><seg type="columnLine">now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Black John surveyed his daughter and al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">.

Uncle Deak had the murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, all wrapped up so the fingerprints</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't rub off." He related the episode of</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding the gun. "And I'll bet a bullet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will match the one that killed the rich oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.

"Your uncle was a strange man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staying on here when he was rich.

SQUARE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By EVERETT M. WEBBER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS a raw, cloudy day--coming dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dirk expected to find his uncle cook-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing supper, or eating it. But the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows of the house showed no light as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped the buckboard. Then Dirk saw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Mac down below the corral working on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earthen dam of his pond. He had evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the buckboard for he straightened slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, one hand at the small of his back, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">still holding the shovel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dirk's heart beat a little fast with a mixture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of apprehension, excitement and something a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little like fear. There was also a tinge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shame mingled with his feeling at being here</seg><seg type="columnLine">begging again. But none of that must show.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waved at the old man, clambered down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swiftly unhooked the horse. Easing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">collar a bit and roughing the wet hair under</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, he tied the animal to the porch post And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, seeing that his uncle wasn't coming up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to greet him, he walked down toward the pond,</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful to close the gates behind him. Bluffly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the croaking of frogs and the blatting</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sheep, he exclaimed, "Hello, there, Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mac! You look younger every time I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">you! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, as he clambered the grassed-over dam</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shook hands with the old man, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his uncle knew he was here again for</seg><seg type="columnLine">money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sweating, old Mac said, "Well, I don't feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">any younger, lad. . . . Guess I've done about</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough here. Just fixing the dam a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the rain. We'll go to the house. Throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">your horse in the corral and feed 'im an' we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat supper. You're in money trouble again?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The words graveled Dirk, but they gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of relief, too, at having the reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his trip brought up. "Well, not exactly trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble," he said, "but I am needing another</seg><seg type="columnLine">loan. "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Mac grunted dourly, squinting at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens as the wind became suddenly dank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then, before they reached the house, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine drizzle set in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll bear in mind," he stated as Dirk</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently untied the horse to lead him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corral, "you haven't paid the other four loans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And like I've told you over and over, I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">let you have any more till I'm paid. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're welcome to stay the night, or longer."</seg><seg type="columnLine">+ * *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only gradually, after supper, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dirk brought the matter up again. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprinkling rather steadily, now, and as old</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mac opened the door to let the extra heat from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire go outside, the buckboard glistened</seg><seg type="columnLine">,in the lamp light, and the bare earth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard shined wetly. A night hawk zipped past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door and away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The fact is," Dirk said as casually as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, "I've had tough luck at cards, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised to pay up in a hurry. Five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hold them off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Mac turned from the doorway and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at Dirk who still sat at the table, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dirk saw that his little eyes were troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he shook his grizzling head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dirk swallowed the black anger that rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">within him, and then the.entire story was tum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling from his lips and he couldn't hold it</seg><seg type="columnLine">back: How he had had to beg like a dog to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few days' grace to drive the sixty miles over</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, across wild prairie, to try to raise a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">cash. How, if he didn't get it, he wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare go back for fear of his very life, and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men he owed would hog up his land, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">well he had dug, and the few cows he still</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But still his uncle shook his head. "I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it, Dirk. I'm an old man. I can't work</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You could live with me. You could sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and get away from this God-forsaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And come to a place where someone else</seg><seg type="columnLine">is owner, a place you'll gamble away any day ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And this isn't so God-forsaken.

It's not</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I want to hurt your feelings, nor--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But like you say," Dirk reasoned des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately, "all you've got will be mine some</seg><seg type="columnLine">da*."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I couldn't live in another man's house, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's what'll happen if I keep giving--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a sudden angry oath, Dirk came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his chair, jerking at the revolver in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waistband under his coat. The old man stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzed a second, there by the door, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that second Dirk was upon him, firing almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his face. Old Mac tottered to a chair, col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapsed across the back of it, and then sprawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor with it half upon him. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">move after that, but a few dops of blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickled down onto th ^vide, clean boards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dirk stood there, stLring down at him, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart thundering furiously. And ihen, half</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud, he panted, "The pennypinching old</seg><seg type="columnLine">varmint--it serves him right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put the gun back into his waistband and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frugal Uncle Mac's idea was never to send good money after</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad, and so be swore he'd rather be dead before he lent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dirk another cent. . . . Which was exactly Dirk's idea, tool</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stood listening, lest there might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone who heard, or saw, the shooting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When there seemed to be no one, he quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">:losed the door. The shades were already</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irawn. At the fireplace, he worked out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">-ight hand corner stone of the hearth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hrust his hand into the hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A SHORT, sharp cry burst from his lips. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ was empty. Frantically he leaned low to</seg><seg type="columnLine">&gt;eer into it, and then he brought up a slip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">laper. The red printing at the top said, "Bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Boiling Springs." And under that: "De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">■osit Receipt." Dirk stared with blurring eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">.t the firm, pale writing under that: "Silver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">670. Currency, $15,665. Gold, $1,445." It</seg><seg type="columnLine">dded up to $17,780.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dirk licked his dry lips. The slip was dated</seg><seg type="columnLine">. scant two weeks before. He put it back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hole and replaced the stone and rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The dirty old varmint 1" he growled. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eart was slowing now, and he forced him-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">self to steadiness as he rose. "Banking it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">now I can't touch a dime." The anger some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how restored him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was his. He was old Mac's only kin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all his. And this little ranch, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could sell for good cash. He wouldn't go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. Let them take his few cattle and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shack. Why, with cash like this, what couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">he do! He would go to some city--maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denver or San Francisco. Liquor--Women</seg><seg type="columnLine">m fine clothes--new cars--good horses. . . ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Set himself up in a nice saloon in a good part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of town.

First, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must get the money.

On the other hand, it was known</seg><seg type="columnLine">there that he had come here--and, besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that infernal buckboard would leave tracks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVERETT M.

First off, he guessed he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should get rid of the gun. And after that,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drive to town and report that he had come to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">see his Uncle Mac, and found him murdered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Maybe they would suspect him, but what could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they prove ? Nothing. All they could do, after</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the funeral, was to hand him the money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He reached for his dusty old hat and jumper</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and put them on. The drilled well, six inches</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in diameter and two hundred feet deep, would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be a fine place for the pistol, and in the pitch</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blackness of the yard Dirk found the little well</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shed. He raised the cover and dropped the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gun in and heard it scrape and bang the casing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">several times before it struck the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The rain was coming harder, now, already</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soaking him through at knee and shoulder as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he headed for the corral. Stooping low, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could faintly see his hammerheaded old horse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">against the skyline. His eyes were getting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">used to the dark. He caught the animal by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mane and led him up by the barn and brought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the harness out and threw it on. The leather</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was wet and slick as he fastened the buckles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was as he reached under for the belly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">band that he heard the pound of hoofs and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then the rattle of a buggy, and for an instant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he leaned there, paralyzed. Whoever it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be coming here, for no one else lived</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down this way. Suddenly he grabbed the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bellyband and buckled it and caught the bit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ring. Let them come. Give him three more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">minutes, and let them come--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He led the horse out of the corral and flung</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">himself upon its back and rode him swiftly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the yard and slid down. In a second, he had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">backed him into the shafts and was fastening</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them. He hooked a tug, then, with the sound</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the horse and buggy coming closer, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ran around to hook the other, and as he undid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the lines from the liame he could see the mov-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing blackness of the rig coming at him. Swift-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ly he clambered to the seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The rig pulled up. A man said, "Hello,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there. That ain't you, is it. Mac?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dirk knew the voice. Old man Vanderwet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then some other man said, "Mac?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dirk got a good grip on his voice. "It's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me," he said. "Dirk Callen. Uncle--Uncle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mac--has been killed--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Vanderwet exclaimed, "I told you! I told</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you something was wrong! " And as the two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">men piled out of the rig, he added, "Every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Friday night for twenty years we've played</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">checkers, and when he didn't show up tonight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--I--I knew something must be wrong, so I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brought the doctor--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Startled, Dirk kept quiet as he stepped from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hub to porch. He had forgotten it was Friday.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Maybe, in the excitement of their talk, h</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">uncle had forgotten it, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The rain beat down with sudden fury as h</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shoved the door open and let the yellow ligV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flood out. That was fine. It would smoot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out the tracks he had made, getting the hors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up here from the barn. He led the way i</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and stood silently as Vanderwet moved pon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">derously behind him.

The doctor, a little man in baggy clothe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whom Dirk did not know, knelt by old Ma</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and took his wrist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And, in surprise, he exclaimed, "Why, he'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only just been shot I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dirk tensed. "He--he's dead, isn't he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There's no doubt of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I heard the shot," Dirk explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drove up just before you got here. I wasn'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quite to the gate when I thought I heard ;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gun, and when I came inside, this is what i</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saw."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The doctor said, "Somebody evidently at&lt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">supper with Mac."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "They must have taken out the back way,'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dirk declared, "when they heard me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why?" Vanderwet exclaimed. "Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">would anybody--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">IJE FIXED a long, searching look on Dirk,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his little grey eyes peering out above</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bustles of grey flesh, his brows glistening a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little with drops of mist. Dirk forced himself</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to keep a steady countenance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You weren't by any chance the one who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ate here?" the old man asked, and his look</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moved to Dirk's shirt front and back up to his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In spite of himself, Dirk glanced down and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saw the streak of egg yoke down his belly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He felt sweat break upon his body. "I ... I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">didn't mean to mention it," he said, "but--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">well, I was starved when I came in Uncle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mac was dead.

"Who can say? Five</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">minutes--ten minutes--maybe a quarter of an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hour. Not longer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I told you I heard the shot!" Dirk ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">claimed. With an effort he toned his voice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down. "I heard it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Vanderwet sighed heavily and picked up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the lamp. "I'll hold the light for you to turn .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around, Doc. Have John and them bring out</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WHITE SQUARE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the very best coffin--that all right, Dirk?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure."

The best."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll lay him out an' shave him while</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're gone," Vanderwet added. He led the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way onto the porch and stood there a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he whirled on Dirk, drawing a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his armpit. He cocked it, holding it un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">waveringly on Dirk's middle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I would enjoy shooting you," he said, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dirk backed toward the table in the room. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope you move one more step." He came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the lamp, squinting his left eye against</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. "Find his pistol.

Rick shouted after her, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurried away and was gone before he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">grab her. He cursed loud and luridly--she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to him! He had to catch her and kill her</seg><seg type="columnLine">before she got away. She was a living, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petent witness who had had plenty of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to memorize his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had the presence of mind to slap his hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his head, hook his dark glasses on his long</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose and grab the briefcase, before he dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hall after her. But the pause had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given her time to disappear; he heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevator doors clang shut and the car was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping out of sight--he knew his ticket to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chair was on it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took the stairs in amazing, long-legged</seg><seg type="columnLine">strides, almost dropping straight down them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the street floor, he compelled himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause a moment, then go swiftly but sanely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the door into the foyer. The elevator</seg><seg type="columnLine">car was loading for another ascent; ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, waddling desperately for the street, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fat slob who could put the finger on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Panic caught at him again. He had to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, had to! It was all he could do to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">from shouting at her to stop; he actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to pull the gun from his pocket to shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">her as she drove ahead through the crojyded</seg><seg type="columnLine">foyer. She paused once as she came abreast</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line of telephone booths, and Rick</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thought: here it is, she's calling the cops</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I can't stop her, here in front of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mob. But she went on, and he guessed with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out looking that the phones were all busy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was a brief respite at best, a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">more steps and she'd be on the street, yelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head off for a cop. Back in his brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">something seemed wrong, for why hadn't she</seg><seg type="columnLine">given the alarm before this, to the elevator op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erator or someone? His quick mind had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer: she was a woman scared silly and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beating it for a place of refuge--her home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably. She'd keep her tongue in silence un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til she could contact someone she trusted--her</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man, likely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She lumbered out onto the street, paused a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, while Rick, panicky in his fear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertainty, weighed his chances of plugging</seg><seg type="columnLine">her right here and running for it, or tailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. He had no choice; while he hesitated, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">popped into a waiting cab and was off down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had a bad few seconds as he got his car</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into traffic, but the drizzling, misty rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped him, the cabby was a cautious soul and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rick caught up with him two blocks down. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept close as they threaded through traffic, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes glued onto the back glass of the cab,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he could see her huddled and staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at him repeatedly in her terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smashed the steering wheel a savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow with his fist and let his rage run free.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The stinking idiot!" he snarled aloud. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to have killed her right there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office, then I wouldn't have to chase her a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple miles to do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came out onto the wide boulevard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the cab speeded up, but Rick drove care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, just keeping his quarry in sight; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't want to be picked up now. The rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat steadily against the windshield; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sedate whir of the wiper was company for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts. His master mind was already busily</seg><seg type="columnLine">at work planning and as it worked, his rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished and his confidence returned. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle this job--easy!" He'd been right back</seg><seg type="columnLine">there--she was holing up somewhere to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance to spill what she'd seen after she got</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her terror. And she wouldn't expect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">killer to trail her clean out here in the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urbs ; she'd figure he was already on the lam.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Which was O.K. for Rick Haines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cab swung-off the boulevard, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a quiet, tree-aisled street, lined on both</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides by big, box-like houses set back from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewalk behind a narrow strip of lawn. Rick</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung in, parked the stolen green Chevvy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched intently; the cab pulled up to the curb</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">59</seg><seg type="columnLine">60</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WILLIAM HELLMAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">half-way down the street, the woman got out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurried up the walk onto the wide porch. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the half-murk, Rick watched intently and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she used a key instead of ringing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell, he laughed in pleased confidence, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant he had guessed aright--she'd be alone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He clambered over the seat back, lifted tne</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear cushion and slid the briefcase back under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mess of papers and old rags he had placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. He waited a while, then drove boldly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and parked before the house. He got</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, swung briskly up the flagstone walk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the porch and punched the button. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't hear the sound of the bell within, so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">punched the button again, peering through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtained glass, and he saw a little light flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">off and on somewhere inside in response to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingered pressure. His lip curled in derision--</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the silly stunts! So the big fool's nerves</seg><seg type="columnLine">were too bad to stand the clatter of a bell, eh ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He never had a doubt that his surmise was</seg><seg type="columnLine">correct, that she would answer his summons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He waited until she opened the door, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at him enquiringly, then he whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the black glasses; she gasped in surprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes amazed. Her hands came up in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture again and before she had the wit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">close the door on him, it was too late; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hall, the door closed, the little gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed deep against her soft, bulging middle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her eyes were big pools of surprised terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a peep!" he warned savagely. "So</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do recognize me, you blundering idiot!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, you'll never live to tell it! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was paralyzed in her horror, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately to back away from him, her fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting helplessly at her mouth, from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">no words would come. He pushed the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun deeper under her sagging breast, fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice, the bullets slanting up and to the right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her clutching fingers clawed at her mouth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">face in a gripping spasm of pain and terror;</seg><seg type="columnLine">she swayed, then crumpled without a sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rick froze crouching over her, listening--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun ready in his hand. But no other sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him, except somewhere the slow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponderous ticking of a clock. The shots had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a small noise, like the snapping of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pencil, and perhaps there was someone else in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another room. He couldn't wait to find out;</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously he investigated and found no one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and relaxed with a grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly, he executed the rest of his light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning plan. He ransacked the house, turning out</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawers and cupboards indiscriminately, spill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their contents in confusion, garnering</seg><seg type="columnLine">items of value into a pillow slip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came downstairs, dropped the sack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">loot with a clatter on the kitchen floor, near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear exit. He unlocked the door, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">it partly open, and dropped the little gun near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by. He allowed himself a moment to grin in</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-appreciation of his cleverness; the dumb</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">police would lay the crime to a prowler who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had killed the woman, ransacked the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then had been frightened into dropping his</seg><seg type="columnLine">loot and escaping out the back door. The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun could be easily traced to a small-time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">misshappen snowbird with a long record.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went back through the hall to where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman still lay, a lumpy, sprawling heap. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered out into the street through the cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain; the rain had stopped, it was wholly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted and gray in the murky half-light. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">put on his glasses, paused, went over and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberately kicked the woman in the face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed and opened the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was half-way through it, when he halted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned--a man was coming toward him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sidewalk, not ten feet from the flagstone</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk. A car was parked a little distance be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the Chewy. Instantly, Rick realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had happened; he hadn't noticed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other car parked by the trees when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked out the curtains, and when he had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to kick the woman, the man had got</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of it. Who was he? But more important,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where was he going?- Rick Haines wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately to duck back into the house, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too late; the man had seen him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His master mind came-promptly to his res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cue. He paused, as though listening to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman past the edge of the partly open door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">said distinctly: "Thank you again, Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anderson. " He almost grinned at the name, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had noticed it on a small plate on her mailbox.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stepped out onto the porch, his hand on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knob holding the door several inches ajar. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">really am sorry. ..." He paused politely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">let her speak, stood-listening and nodding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that the little man on the sidewalk had</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowed, was looking at him curiously. Rick</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignored him. "Yes ... I understand ... be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve me, I'm sorry, too. Well..." He laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruefully. "Guess I'll have to ask elsewhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But thank you again. And goodbye," he added</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallantly and closed the door behind him, ;</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing that the spring lock would work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little guy on the sidewalk was still look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at him, walking slowly, and a sudden rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">flared up in Rick Haines, and he swore silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he'd be damned if he'd leave a witness</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time, no matter how remote the chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being identified, nor how involved the I</seg><seg type="columnLine">task of bumping him off. He had cleverly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">effectively -lulled any suspicions the lug may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had as to his business here, and now to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get him into the Chewy and the rest would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be easy. And in his pocket a gun, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a license to carry because of his apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawful profession, would be enough persuasion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This buzzo was going to die!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped the little man with a word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What a skinny, innocent-looking worm! "Can</seg><seg type="columnLine">you please tell me where J. E. Thalmus lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">hereabouts?" he asked politely. "Mrs. Ander- .</seg><seg type="columnLine">EASY KILL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">son tells me she never heard of him at all."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The little man's eye brows went up just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitch. "Mrs. Anderson said that? Now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is strange--I mean, she has lived here all her</seg><seg type="columnLine">life and gets about a lot and knows every soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this quiet little street. She's a nice woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Anderson; kind and quiet-spoken."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You know her?" Rick asked and a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm bell tinkled back in his brain somewhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, she is." Who is this lousy little runt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway ? Have I seen him some place before ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">His hand went rigid, hard on the gun in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket. He was aware of the little guy's stare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his quick glance at the bulging hand in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket. He laughed. "Well, I guess I'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go back for a better address."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved a little, looking about to see if any</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance window-watcher might see him force</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little mug into the Chewy. Then the pee-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wee surprised him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look," he said suddenly, in a sort of des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate, choked voice, "would you give me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift downtown?" He laughed ruefully. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasted skate of mine there quit on me up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street and I coasted to here. "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, sure!" Rick agreed heartily. "Glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have you." His heart was singing now--</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy, what a break! A solid, hard whack on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzzo's neck, then drive out along the high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, open the door on that curve and let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body spill out, over the bank in the dark, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the river below. As simple as that--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little runt asking for it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came down off the quiet, tree-lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">street onto the boulevard lanes, then turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">west; there were plenty of places along here</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he could knock the little guy out before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they got into the congested district where</seg><seg type="columnLine">traffic was heavy. He'd take it slow. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At an intersection, a cop stood in the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">newed drizzle, directing cross-traffic. Rick</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowed the car to the required twenty-five; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too smart to slip up now. But as they ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the officer, the little man suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught at the steering wheel with both hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaved with all his puny might. His might</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as little as his body, but the maneuver</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught Rick off guard because it was totally</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpected. Before his amazed senses could</seg><seg type="columnLine">react properly, the wheel spun in his relaxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, the car swerved and plowed with a.</seg><seg type="columnLine">rending crash into an iron trolley pole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The impact dazed him; for a moment he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't move. But the little man had the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, was out on the street. The cop came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, angry and bawling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch that man!" the little fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrilled. "He's dangerous. He just killed Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Anderson because he thought she saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him kill my cashier."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My cashier ! Rick heard the words and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">numb--so he had seen the mug before--when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he had cased the joint. He started up, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cop was beside him, the door open, his big</seg><seg type="columnLine">service pistol in his mitt. That cop wasn't a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coward, but he wasn't a fool either.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come out of there, fellow," he said stolidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cold terror revived Rick Haines. "He's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool," he said furiously. "The jackass asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">me for a lift, wrecked my car.

"Look, officer, I returned from</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunch, found my man dead, the safe looted. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered that this is the day of the month</seg><seg type="columnLine">that poor Kelly stayed to attend to Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anderson. She always came at noon when</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone else was out--you see, Officer, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sort of sensitive about her--her ailment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Kelly was the only one she would con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse with. She came today, stumbled on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">guy tapping the till, didn't see poor Kelly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left because she was unwilling to deal with</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone else! I don't believe she had any idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all that this thug had killed, but--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You libelous little fool!" Rick ranted. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept his senses by reminding himself that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't pin a thing on him. Sure they'd find</seg><seg type="columnLine">her dead, but this runt himself would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit she was still alive when they left her!</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I never harmed your man, nor Mrs. Ander-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. You heard me talking to her when I--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," the little man said again. He grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly. "That's what put me next to you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned me you were a phoney with something</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hide. I came out to talk to Mrs. Anderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">because she--well, she can't use the phone. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw you come out, got a little suspicious, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd have to let you go unnoticed--if you hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped to talk to her. The rest I added up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when I saw that gun in your fist in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket, I was sure. I was sure, too, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car was stolen, so I deliberately got you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give me alift so I could--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a fool!" Rick snarled, but some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the little man's grin put terror in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul. "Mrs. Anderson was alive when I left</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. I talked to her--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, but she didn't talk back. She didn't,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because she couldn't! That's why she used a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door-light instead of a bell--that should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">tipped you off, if you saw it. And that's why</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kelly alone could talk to her; he alone could</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk with his hands! You see, wise guy, Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anderson did not talk to you, because she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deaf mute, born deaf and dumb! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rick's panic possessed him completely then.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He forgot everything, even his gun, in his lust</seg><seg type="columnLine">for life. He swung around the car, raced in</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony for the shielding corner and escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The policeman's bullet sliattered his leg, drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping him screaming to the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wise guy," the little man said.

Her eyes were on the glassy side</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . you know. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who else was here then, Whitey?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just the usual. Barney Emmett was hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over the piano and she wasn't giving him</seg><seg type="columnLine">any chatter at all. Her face was white and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she looked plenty sore at the guy. And Cass</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edwards was around with his gang, pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk and loud."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should have busted Barney Emmett's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern jaw a long time ago," said Eddie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The way he hangs around Flora. "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Barney's not a guy you can bust," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitey, shrugging bitterly. "Lot of people</seg><seg type="columnLine">have tried that to their sorrow. And I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flora can handle herself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie finally got the shot glass to his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">without spilling more than a third of it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who went with Flora when she left here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitey?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dunno, kid. She goes out the back way</seg><seg type="columnLine">after leaving the message for you and I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice particularly. Why? How come you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">so upset about the dame all of a sudden ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddie was watching the bartender's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">very closely, but Whitey had a hard map to</seg><seg type="columnLine">read and he looked as calm as ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just in the mood for asking questions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitey. That's all. She said I shouldn't wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her, huh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what time did she say it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Four o'clock."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Okay, Whitey. So long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie glanced once at the piano as he left</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flora wouldn't be sitting there tonight playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">those lazy tunes she toved so much. Her round</seg><seg type="columnLine">white arms wouldn't be moving with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythms of the dreamy spell she created. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth was gone. The piano looked black</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cold, as forbidding as an automatic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked two blocks down and got into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fare came up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry, buddy," said Eddie. "I got a call."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He drove off, his hands sweating on the wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whitey was a damn liar! At four o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">that afternoon Flora had been dead for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours! It was just after his noon stop for</seg><seg type="columnLine">eggs and a cup of steam that he'd found her</seg><seg type="columnLine">body stuffed into the back of his cab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not all of her body--just part of it-- Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head with a few strands of the blonde hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught in the zipper of the leather bowling</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shock hadn't worn off. It was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding through him, making it impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to think of what he ought to do. Go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the police? Hell, they'd slap him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clink so fast he -wouldn't have a chance. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be open and shut to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flora was a handful as well as an eyeful..</seg><seg type="columnLine">And when you're married to a dame like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's bound to be other guys. And in a spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that the cops can figure you've got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid motive for killing her. Somebody else</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thought of that angle and had planted</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough evidence in his cab to send him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. Eddie didn't want to play that way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he had kept quiet all afternoon, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to guess it out. He had put the bowling bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the trunk of the car without looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing again. One look had been enough. (</seg><seg type="columnLine">One touch of the yellow hair, one glimpse of1</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fair skin faintly dotted with freckles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew vaguely what he had to do now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The same thing he'd done a lot of other nights.;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look for Flora. Only this time he wouldn't;</seg><seg type="columnLine">be expecting to find her higher than a kite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the rounds of the joints with five or</seg><seg type="columnLine">six men. He'd be looking for the rest of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. It had to be somewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when he found it, he might find evi-.</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence enough on somebody else to make it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right for him to yell copper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But not until. Eddie knew enough about</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstantial evidence to know that he'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody's choice for the most likely suspect..</seg><seg type="columnLine">A clear conscience doesn't do you any good</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all. Not if the court thinks you're guilty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE DROVE to the apartment to shave and</seg><seg type="columnLine">change clothes, trying desperately to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think straight with his aching head. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was for sure. Somebody had killed Flora</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was trying to frame him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Eddie hadn't any desire to burn for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder he didn't commit. There wasn't any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By DOROTHY DUNN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt;71</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DOROTHY DUNN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">special reason why he should want to go on</seg><seg type="columnLine">living, he told himself. He didn't have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">helluva lot to look forward to, but he kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of little things he liked about being</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive. He got a kick out of the goofy fares he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran across; he liked the thick flapjacks he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got at the diner with the hunks of hard butter</seg><seg type="columnLine">melting under the syrup; he liked to walk up</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randolph Street on his night off and maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">take in a movie; he liked big steins of beer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the summer and the free concerts in Grant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Park. Not much to live for, but it was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life and he liked it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something else was important beside saving</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own skin. Somebody had killed Flora and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they ought not to get away with it. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lousy thing and made him burn deep inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a longing to get his hands around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">killer's throat and give him a dose of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">medicine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought about Flora as he snaked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cab through the heavy traffic to his apartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the south side. He didn't have much real</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling left for her. He'd loved her plenty in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginning, like all these other guys did</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Some dames are like that. They got</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts so big they can always find room for</seg><seg type="columnLine">one more. And that's a good kind of woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be crazy about, but it's hell to be married</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You get to watching out for her like you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would a kid, because she's not too bright about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the company she keeps. You quit being jealous</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a while and just hope she won't get onto</seg><seg type="columnLine">reefers or something really bad. You let her</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the job at Whitey's playing the piano.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And you hope it'll do her good. But it doesn't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Too many guys come in there that fall for her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It makes it easier to keep track of her, though.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You know it's always from Whitey's that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">started out and that makes it simpler to pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">up her trail if you have to go out looking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So when she gets killed, you don't ciy your</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes out. But you do start remembering her</seg><seg type="columnLine">round white arms, her full red lips, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way she always had a smile for everybody,</seg><seg type="columnLine">including you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie remembered how warm her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">always were, how full of love and excitement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had led him a dog's life, sure. But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't ever been any other woman for him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he'd hunt out her killer if it was the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he ever did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And it'll probably be that, he thought grimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he climbed the stairs to their two-room</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment. Especially if I have to tangle with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney Emmett. Whitey was right--nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever had any luck getting the goods on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">guy--not even the cops. He had an organiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that made Capone's old gang look like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch of boy scouts. And Barney had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing Flora pretty often. He was in Whitey's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">placg nearly every night. In fact, since Flora</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone to work there, Barney had prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically taken over at the small tavern. Eddie</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, just thinking about that big jutting jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the thick, selfish mouth. Guys like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldn't be allowed to operate the way they</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. They get too smart, get to thinking they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">like God. But Whitey was right. Try to buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">up against a thug like Barney! You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">better--you don't know how you know--you</seg><seg type="columnLine">just do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie snapped the lights on, noticing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment was just the way it always was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rooms smelled musty and the Murphy bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was folded up sloppily, the mattress sagging</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it had slipped out of the clamps. Flora's</seg><seg type="columnLine">make-up things were scattered over the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desk in the livingroom because there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a better light there. Her mascara box was</seg><seg type="columnLine">open and she had left a stocking hanging over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of a chair. There was that choking</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust over everything, big gray rolls of it under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy pieces of furniture where Flora</seg><seg type="columnLine">said it didn't show anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked into the dinette and kitchen. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast dishes were still in the sink. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">cup was there and Flora's with the lipstick</seg><seg type="columnLine">smear on one side and there was an egg shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the stove where Flora must have aimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the can and missed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing looks different, he thought. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">half expected to see something changed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show that Flora had broken her usual routine</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the day of her murder. But she must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone out like always, not expecting anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">to happen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie put the bowling bag into the far cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner of the closet, not knowing what else to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it. He couldn't keep carrying it around</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his cab. Just touching the leather straps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feeling the weight of it, produced a quick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slimy sweat on his skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took a warm shower and then went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the closet to get his good suit, the double-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breasted brown that Flora had liked. He tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to think of the grisly thing that was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dark corner of the cubicle. He won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered if he would shudder like this every time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he opened the closet door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put his old suit on the hanger--funny--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't have to squeeze all the clothes back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get it on the rod--there seemed to be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Then his eyes really focused on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flora's clothes were gone ! The fur coat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her two evening dresses that she wore on spe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial nights at Whitey's. The plain black tiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she wore so it always looked like a dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent dress, sometimes with a lace collar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes with beads, and sometimes with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewel belt. The green wool that she said made</seg><seg type="columnLine">her look hippy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All her clothes gone out of the closet. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE LAST SONG FOR FLORA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">no make-up things! That looked plenty queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Eddie. Flora would rather go off without</seg><seg type="columnLine">her dresses than without her mascara and</seg><seg type="columnLine">creams and powder. Not only that, the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">suitcase they had was still on the closet shelf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was empty. Eddie looked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">SPHERE was only one answer. Flora hadn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">packed those clothes herself! Somebody</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">else had run the risk of coming here and leav-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing with a suitcase full on the day she was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">murdered and cut up into pieces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   He switched off the lights and went out the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back way onto the concrete porch and down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the back steps to the janitor's apartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Maybe Albert had seen somebody around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Albert came to the door looking comfortable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a pipe in his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hello, Mr. Henderson. What's on the bum</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">now? I fixed that stopped drain last week."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yeah, I know. Thanks, Albert Say, did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you see anybody around here today?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Always see people around. Dozens.

"Nope, don't recall seeing anybody</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around your place. Your wife out helling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around again, Mr. Henderson?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That's none of your damn business 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flared Eddie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Now wait a minute," soothed Albert in his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gentle drawl, "I didn't mean to go stickin'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my nose in where it don't belong.

But it's no secret in this building</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about what kind of a life Mrs. Henderson</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">leads you. You're a hard-working, steady sort</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of man and it's a shame what you have to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">put up with. I just asked because if there's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">! anything I can do. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Eddie gave him a crooked grin, sorry that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ihe'd blown his top.

Maybe that's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">j not even the one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">; "What did he look like, Albert?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">| "I hardly noticed. Big heavy-set iellow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with thick lips, dark hair, I think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Barney Emmett! Those lips always stuck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">! out. Albert would have turned white if he'd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">realized that he had just put the finger on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">big shot hood himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, thanks Albert.

Take it easy," said Eddie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He climbed into his cab and drove toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitey's place. He had to find the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flora and then find her kiHer. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're looking for Flora, it's always Whitey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you start out from.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But he didn't get far. A black sedan shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of a side street, half a block from his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment and nosed his cab to the curb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What the hell. .. ?" muttered Eddie, star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the muzzle of an automatic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Climb out, hacker.

Just a crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">of punks out on a routine pick-up job and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to have a little fun on the side scaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Well, he wasn't scared. If Barney Em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mett wanted to see him, it saved him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble of looking for Barney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fished out a cigarette.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney slapped out with the gun butt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraping Eddie's cheek. His thick neck was</seg><seg type="columnLine">red and he was puffing like an angry bull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So the black boy did recognize me! But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I didn't ask about that. I said, 'Where's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flora ?' If you don't tell me. I'll choke it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your skinny neck.

Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">what did you do to her?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney's hot breath was right in Eddie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and the look in the man's eyes was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">insane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't do anything to her," snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddie.

But if he hadn't killed her, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">would he be so excited? You don't look the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he looked just because some dame you</seg><seg type="columnLine">like doesn't show up for a few hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Henderson if you lie to me.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed Barney and said so with his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big man heaved a long sigh and dug</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his cheeks with his meaty hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I loved Flora, Hnderson. That's a hell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing, but there it is. I loved her too damn</seg><seg type="columnLine">much and somebody knew that! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie looked the other way. Barney Em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mett, the toughest man in Chicago, had tears</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was four o'clock in the morning. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">back room at Whitey's was filled with a blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">haze of smoke and the damp malty odor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much alcohol breath breathed into an al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most airless room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cass Edwards and his three worthless</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends were there being worked over by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney. Eddie hated all four men. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, they were supposed to be from qual-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity. Cass Edwards, especially. Yet they hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a place like Whitey's, drunk all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and they had often taken Flora off on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their slumming trips. Eddie considered them</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worst degenerates in the book. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't satisfied to go to hell themselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They wanted to take other people along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T&gt;ARNEY slapped Cass again, his heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers leaving big red streaks on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For God's sake, Barney!"

What was in it?" Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've told you. A hand--a human hand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Flora's? Her right hand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," mumbled Cass. "It looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like hers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what did you do with it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE LAST SONG FOR FLORA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I told you that, too.

Tell me again!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddie wondered what kind of a torture</seg><seg type="columnLine">method this was. Cass was desperate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I threw it down a manhole," he repeated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh Dearborn Street off Randolph."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, for God's sake, Barney, let up!" .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cass broke then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the hell did I want to keep it for?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he yelled, "What good is a dead hand?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">That did it. Barney jerked Cass up out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chair and dragged him over to the table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He called to the down, the gunman that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked Eddie up in the sedan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold this right here," Barney instructed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The clown looked as happy as a lark as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he held the right wrist of Cass Edwards flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie got a little sick when he heard Cass</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream with pain every time the gun butt came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. It was a relief when he fainted. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone in his right hand must have been crushed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That'll show him," rasped Barney, breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like an ox, "That'll show him what good</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a hand!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie didn't like Cass Edwards, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't stand much more of this. Barney was</seg><seg type="columnLine">letting his emotions take over, he was acting</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy. He hadn't got to be the biggest man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Chicago rackets this way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Cass was crying like a baby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why don't you just kill me?" he screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Barney. He was hysterical.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to," said Barney in his coldest</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, "As soon as I check your story."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then Alex, one of the gunmen, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with a wet-looking cigar box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here it is, boss. I had one helluva</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who asked about your troubles?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barney, cutting him short. He took the box</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked inside. He closed it quickly. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he placed it on the table beside the other cigar</seg><seg type="columnLine">box that had been mailed to him. The bowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bag was there, too. Barney hadn't lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">any time sending to get it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">."I told you it would be there," said Cass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocking on the floor, cradling his broken hand..</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now, can I see a doctor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah," said Barney. "You'll need one."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The shot was a thundering blast in the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, and the smell of cordite curled up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddie's nostrils along with the stale air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney put the gun back on the table with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out batting an eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He shoulda had more respect for Flora</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to pick a sewer," he said. "Now we got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find the rest of her body. Alex!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, boss?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No you're too dumb. Monk, come here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Barney?" The clown stepped up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Check the morgue again, the police blotter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can do all that through Daly. I want that</seg><seg type="columnLine">torso! Flora's going to have a decent funeral</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a casket. It's not right. ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off, knowing he was giving out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with too much sentiment. Monk went out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You got any ideas, Henderson? Any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">guys we can pick up who might know some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing? What about that janitor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a chance," said Eddie, thinking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albert's round, gentle face. "Flora left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house alive. We know that. You've traced her</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements as far as Whitey's, or almost."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yeah," said Barney thoughtfully. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a long drink, draining the bottle. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk in the drug store saw her at eleven</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock this morning, and it was just a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">after noon time that she was killed. Had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. The package was delivered to me by four."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddie almost had a thought right then, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it didn't quite come clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd like a drink," he said suddenly. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">head feels a little foggy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Okay," said Barney. "Go get a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottles, Henderson. And Alex! Clear out</seg><seg type="columnLine">this mess of society trash. No wonder we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't think straight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All of 'em, boss?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hell, yes!

Scared all the way down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heels and sicker inside than he'd ever been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his life. Barney wasn't human. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">some kind of monster, operating the deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery of murder the way an ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">business man does a day's work. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see why people didn't try to cross Barney,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why they couldn't He could even understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">why the cops couldn't touch him. Nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">could touch him and live!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie should have gone to the cops in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning. He knew that now. He'd been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn fool to let Barney take over the job of</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding Flora's killer. The man was a maniac,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Eddie would have felt a lot safer in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">death house than he felt right now,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whitey was leaning on the bar, sulking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Barney wants two bottles," said Eddie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whitey got them down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He say anything about paying for them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Eddie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He never pays!" moaned Whitey.

She feared that she would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick again, and hastened to the railing, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">she leaned for a moment, exhausted, her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning dizzily. But, gradually, the rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">water beneath her took on clarity; she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make out the small ripples that caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon and winked it back at her in a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">little sparkles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She slipped one long leg over the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron railing, pulled herself to a sitting posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion,»and put both feet on the small ledge on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the far side.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeves of his shirt were rolled to the elbows;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shirt was open at the throat. 'His hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed freshly wet.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched her hands against her nakedness, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slight movements brought a further sting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sensation to her nose.

He had been discharged</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the war was finished, without benefit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">points, for there were in him odd pieces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japanese-made metal that caused peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">pains. Recently, though, the doctors had</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospected with success and found the alien</seg><seg type="columnLine">lode, so that within a month or so he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be fit and well again, ready to pick up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush and palette with more result than he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the recent past.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And that," he said as they drove toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Idlewood, "brings you up to date on me.

She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to talk of simple things like wars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">housing situations in the clear and dripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning sunlight, for she didn't have to go too</seg><seg type="columnLine">far into her mind to get the necessary thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and words. Her sentences came as easily as</seg><seg type="columnLine">her clothes had come, when this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man had pointed to a closet and told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to use what she wanted. What hSd he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said? Oh, yes. "Some of the things belong to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my sister--some were left by models. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Marion drew in great lungfuls of the fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">crisp Connecticut morning.

It gripped her during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the ride. When the coupe pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the long gravel driveway of Idlewood, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it almost impossible to stop trembling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She was afraid. . . . The terror she asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciated with this rambling country mansion re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned with a strange insistence. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of Jan and Roger and Mr. Billing. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">all had to do with the last time, when she'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">overheard Roger -- Jan's recently-returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man--saying that the shock of Harry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death was too great a blow for Marion's mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to handle. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As they stopped in front of the house, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front door opened and a girl came out to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the short flight of stone steps. She bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">her blonde head forward, peering into the car.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seeing Marion, she came quickly down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps, her shapely legs flashing in the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Marion!" she cried. "Oh, Marion, dear!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm so glad you're all right. We were so wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried about you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They got out of the car. Though she shiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered, Marion allowed her sister to embrace</seg><seg type="columnLine">her for a moment before she had to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Janis was an impressionable young</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, three years Marion's junior, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">always looked to her sister for guidance since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the death of their parents when they were little</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After she had disentangled herself from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sister's embrace, Marion introduced Mac.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. MacClure is almost a neighbor, Janis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He--he lives over in that little cottage near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "How nice," Janis said. She really was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested in him, and Marion felt embar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rassed.

There was laughter, or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hint of it, at least, in Joseph Billing's boom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing voice. He was a huge man, given to loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties, but his benevolent ogreish manner did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not fool Marion for an instant. He was an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other one of them. He'd been Harry's lawyer;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was staying here now to settle the estate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had known him since she was quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nervously, she looked to Duncan, a mute</seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JOHN BENDER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pleading in her eyes for him not to reveal</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grinned quickly.

Marion felt suddenly weak;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fearful sickness threatened to return. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the queer, frozen expression Duncan</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore as he saw the effect of his words on these</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and the man who had come out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Really, Marion," said Roger Southern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying past the others across the flagstones</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her, "you should have known better!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Janis caught her fiance's hand. She seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cling to him for strength which Duncan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">words had stolen from her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was pretty bad taste, Marion," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. She turned, still holding Roger's hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started for the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a minute, dear," said Rogers, and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marion's arm solicitously. "Come along, now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll get you to bed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marion turned to Duncan. His face told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was struggling to understand. She felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a momentary twinge of pity, then again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner fear. She did not want to say what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to say, but perhaps it was best, to tell him</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and get him out of her mixed-up life. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know; she didn't know. If only she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could escape these scenes, these prying peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should have--told you," she said testily</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. Why did she hope suddenly that he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he alone, would understand and help her?</seg><seg type="columnLine">". . . you see, Duncan, it was not'the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time--last night. It happened before--the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Harry was killed. He was my step-father.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was buried yesterday. ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry," Duncan said. "If I'd known--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course, of course," said Roger. "But as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Carter's doctor, I'd suggest we all get</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside, out of this treacherous weather."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The house was warmer, but the smell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, the smell of flowers and an aged musti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, clung everywhere. Marion wanted only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be alone, away from these people. She felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly very tired, even though she had slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">well in Duncan's tiny, hat-box of a house. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Last night. . . . Could she ever forget that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmare? Or--did she really want to for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get it? At least when she was like last night</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no silly scenes like the one just</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fPHE queer little man with the funny brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes sat in a chair in the corner of the hall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. He rose as they came toward him and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffled his battered hat quite foolishly in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">haads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He peered owlishly at Marion. "Back, eh?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good thing." He had a gold-filled smile which</seg><seg type="columnLine">did nothing for his personality. "Had these</seg><seg type="columnLine">folks mighty worried, Miss Carter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When no one introduced him, he took care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it himself: "I'm Hamilton Pine, Police De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment," and flashed a badge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, see here, Pine," Roger Southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Won't take a moment, Doctor," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When your folks called up last night, the sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion police didn't pay much attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">call. Biit I figured I'd drop out here early this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning just in case. You know, Miss Carter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's still a few things we'd like to clear up</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Mr. Johnson's death. And we'd like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that you're available for questioning--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's nothing to clear up!" Joseph Bill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing inserted his hugeness between Marion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little detective. "The coroner's inquiry</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined it was an accidental death."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pine nodded. "So I heard. But I still got</seg><seg type="columnLine">my opinions, and the cornor isn't in charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Homicide. Harry Johnson was shot to death</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the woods. No witnesses. All we find</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a gun beside him. Anybody--even a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">--could have plucked him off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dammit, man, are you suggesting--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look," said Pine, "it's common gossip that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this Miss Carter has no great love for her step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">father since that time he breaks up her ro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mance with that flyer fellow, last year. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Carter is also inclined to--er--" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked hard, searchingly at Marion--"go a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little out of her head at time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pine, I'll have your badge for libel!" Bill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing roared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marion looked from the little man to Dun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can, who was standing in the doorway, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lean face splashed with shadows. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows in his eyes, too, she thought, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded her silently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The detective was still grinning when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked to the door, nodded at no one in par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular, and sauntered out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duncan said, "Perhaps--perhaps it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be best if I called another time, Marion. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">look in on you in a day or so," and quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished from the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marion heard the roar of his car's motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the drive. She was sure that she had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for the last time. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bright and early on the following morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duncan MacClure proved her wrong; he ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived with a bunch of wild flowers he'd picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her. And the next day, when the butler</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced him, Marion took a few minutes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dab her cheeks and brighten her lips with lip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick. Duncan was gay and friendly and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">her feel so much better that she was amazed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The third day he phoned, suggesting that</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLIND DATE WITH THE DEVIL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">~ 81</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she go riding with him. Marion found herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager for his company--to get away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. The only relief throughout the days</seg><seg type="columnLine">was when she saw Duncan. Idlewood had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be unbearable, with its austere loneliness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whispering shadows that hovered every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. She didn't dare let her fears take shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her mind, but the battle was growing into</seg><seg type="columnLine">too great a one for her to carry done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was ready a full ten minutes before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duncan arrived. In the car, he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been doing a little snooping, Marion,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she felt the surge of fear in her breast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm sure I can help you," he went on. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">only you'll let me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Really," she pleaded. "There's nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can do--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There must be!" His vehemence almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">took them off the road. "No girl as young and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty as you goes around trying to kick her</seg><seg type="columnLine">life away. Is it a man ?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, she thought, it is a man. A man named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry Johnson. He is dead, and maybe I</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed him. I don't know, I don't know. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">drag it out into the open, Duncan, please.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She caught herself in time "No, it's not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, Duncan. I don't know why I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there must be a reason why you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried twice to kill yourself, Marion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were in the village now, the quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaint old New England village, with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny, scattered shops and silent people. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped the car, in front of a combination</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacksmith shop and garage. "Why don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">try telling me about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly she found herself talking:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know how to describe it, Duncan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's as if there were a voice inside of me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling me to destroy myself. Both times I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been alone, at night. I wake up, only it's as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm still asleep and dreaming. A nightmare.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's a haze, like a faint fog--it suffocates</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Everything and everyone is too much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear--I want to get away from the death-</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelling house, from my room, from Jan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roger and Mr. Billing. I'm--I'm afraid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. . . . This voice tells me that the river is</seg><seg type="columnLine">my only friend and that I should go there. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">so awfully hard to think, Duncan. There's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">?nst this voice--which is not a voice, really,</seg><seg type="columnLine">know--and the queer feeling in the pit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my stomach, as if I'm going to be dreadfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">skk." Her voice was less controlled; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the sobs were crowding into the words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why?" he asked. "Why? Did Harry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death mean so much to you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a shock. I respected him, and he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been awfully good to Janis. and me. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved me from making a fool of myself over</seg><seg type="columnLine">some man who was infatuated with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">money--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've talked with Pine. He seems to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was why you hated Harry Johnson."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I didn't hate him," she sobbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHE stopped, feeling peculiarly uneasy. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ stomach fluttered slightly; her nostrils</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivered against the odor which was sicken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ugh!" She sniffed. "That smell____Let's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">get away from here, Duncan. I can't stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">it--reminds me of the warm, suffocating odor</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nights when. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sniffed, too, then looked into the black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">smith shop. A drift of the odor moved lazily</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the faint breeze. "He must be having</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble with his draft in there. You're right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is awful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They drove back to Idlewood in silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Janis, Roger and Mr. Billings were</seg><seg type="columnLine">having tea. Duncan declined an invitation to</seg><seg type="columnLine">join them, but finally promised to come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner that evening!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marion walked to the door with him, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanting him to go. She knew she'd be afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">without him. She was hardly prepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way he wrapped his strong, tweed clad</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm around her and drew her close. His lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched briefly, found hers, and was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was more upset by Duncan's quick em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brace than she had been by his telling her</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had been asking questions in the vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage. And she was far from happy that Janis</seg><seg type="columnLine">had insisted he come back for dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Janis stopped at her room that night, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see if she were ready to go down for dinner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marion hadn't dressed. She was lying across</seg><seg type="columnLine">her bed, clad in her faded blue bathrobe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Really, Marion!" Janis said. "I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd be all excited about tonight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marion closed her eyes tightly, to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">her fear from showing. "I'm not coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. I don't want--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But darling, you must!" Her younger</seg><seg type="columnLine">sister's voice held the softest note of sympathy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I wouldn't have invited him--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop it, Jan! I don't want to see him, do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you hear!" She flung her face into the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tective shadows of the pillow, sobbing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Janis' hand found her shoulder, comforting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "Marion, you can't make me believe what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're saying."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jan, oh, Jan," Marion sobbed. "I can't see</seg><seg type="columnLine">him again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, darling, why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must know," Marion said fiercely. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirthless smile became a snarl upon her lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How can I think of loving anyone? Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">letting anyone love me? I'm not a normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">young woman--I'm Marion Carter, don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember? The girl the police think killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her step-father!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, let me finish." She grew calmer now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">btit since she had started talking, she was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer afraid to say what she had to say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">82</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JOHN BENDER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Twice I've tried to kill myself--you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. Well, what assurance do I have that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't try to do it again ?

Or you ... or Roger--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop it, Marion! Stop it I" Her younger</seg><seg type="columnLine">sister's hand lashed out and caught her across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face, leaving the reddened imprint of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers on the whiteness of the skin. "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">not going to help yourself like this! You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">not going to kill anyone. Do you hear me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tenderly, Janis placed her arm around her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sister's shoulder. "You've got to snap out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. Come on, now. Be a good girl "</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marion felt weak. Spent by her outburst,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she meekjy found herself submitting, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Janis helped her dress. But even then, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a chilling trepidation. How long had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">been now since she had tried to kill--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She tried to banish the thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she was just about to leave, Mary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the maid, came in to lay a few chunks of coal</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the fireplace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll just take the chill off your room. Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marion," the maid said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marion thanked her and went on down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs. She was just in time to meet Duncan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arriving. His mouth opened in frank ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miration of her loveliness; he whistled softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grinned, then, and said something like,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hubba, hubba," she thought. He came for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward as if to take her in his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The others were in the library, sleek and</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable-looking in their evening clothes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roger, impeccable as ever, wore a splash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored, lapel decorations he'd acquired in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war. Drinks were served, and Marion</seg><seg type="columnLine">found Duncan watching her queerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She felt uncomfortable as if something were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to happen at any moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was this to be another night of horror ... ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just after dinner, when they were having</seg><seg type="columnLine">their coffee and liquer, Duncan exploded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombshell. He held aloft his tiny glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A toast," he told the others gaily. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at Marion for a moment, the ghost of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smile in his eyes. His glass dipped to her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a salute. "To the future Mrs. Duncan Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clurel"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fPHERE was a stir of excitement around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Marion looked with startled eyes at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faces there; they were looking to her for</seg><seg type="columnLine">confirmation. She saw Duncan's glance, eager,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely, mutely pleading, and again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surge of uneasiness filled her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How nice," Janis said finally. "How very</seg><seg type="columnLine">nice. She beamed from her sister to Duncan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Congratulations!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then everyone babbled. She tried to speak</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">into the small sea of sound, but her voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept away by Duncan's next speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We intended to keep it a secret for a while</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer, but--" He grinned at them, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glance he gave Marion was secretive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidding her not to interrupt. His hand found</seg><seg type="columnLine">hers, squeezed it hard. "Well, fact of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter is, I'll be leaving here shortly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking Marion with me--''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leaving?" Roger asked. "Where to?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've got a commission to do some murals</seg><seg type="columnLine">in San Francisco."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billing nodded heavily. "But need you two</seg><seg type="columnLine">just pack oif--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's quite necessary," Duncan said firmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It'll take a good six months to do the work."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He drew Marion to him, briefly, then made</seg><seg type="columnLine">apologies to the others for his sudden haste</seg><seg type="columnLine">in leaving. In the hall, he stopped her ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions with a softly-laid finger on her lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know I was rather abrupt, but you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to believe me. I love you. I want you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry me." He grinned his pleasant, lop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sided grin. "Don't rush into it--if you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to think about it . .. I--I couldn't resist</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chance to be dramatic in there--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Duncan, you don't know me--you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know what it's like for me--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know this," he said firmly. He kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See what I mean ?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Downstairs the clock struck three, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemn booming notes that tore through her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she knew with one part of her mind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been in bed for four hours now. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had felt surprisingly fine after Duncan had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone; she had gone to bed far happier than</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been anytime since Harry had died...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had she slept, she wondered. She had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">recollection of a lapse of time, or the unaware-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness that usually is associated with sleep. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness she had lain, listening despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself to the sounds the old house made, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creaking which told her that the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">was settling for the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Am I alone, she wondered. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The question thrilled her immensely. It be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came suddenly important that she find out if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was anyone else in the big house. Hwrry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she thought, I must hurry or they will find</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and put me bock in bed, and Roger will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">called, and he will give me a sleeping pill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly she flung the covers away, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped out onto the thickly-carpeted floor. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved quickly and lithely--unaware of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange beauty in the pale moonlight which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeped into a corner of the room. Perhaps two</seg><seg type="columnLine">or three steps from the bed she stumbled but</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She remembered, only vaguely, the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">time--the time when she had almost suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded. She remembered, but with a thick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">furry edge upon her thoughts, so that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLIND DATE WITH THE DEVIL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">less a memory than an instinct. Who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped her . .. ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crossing the room, she caught faint sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of herself in the full-length mirror. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, a wave of weakness assailed her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she stood wavering in the darkness over near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall. On her quivering legs, she made</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the door, the first wave of sickness clutch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at her. No, she thought, I must not get</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned the knob and stepped outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the corridor. There were no sounds in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house. The long, carpeted corridor which</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to the staircase wore not a light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If only I don't get sick. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moving slowly, with almost exaggerated</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical attempts at silence, she reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs. It was growing clearer in her mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the nausea; she knew exactly what</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had to do, now. Outside, she could race</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the river. Even now she could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight on the bridge and the water--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool, inviting water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within a minute she had reached the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and was out through it. The night was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not very cold, but with the sickness in her she</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a chill. Her heart was racing wildly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reckless urgency made her move more quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. She felt the sharp ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was free! Free at last!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Marion 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voice chased her, then she heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">footsteps pounding behind. A pair of arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamped about her; despite her struggles she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not break free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Marion! Stop it!" the voice commanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She struggled all the more, now. She must</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to the river. She must!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hold on her relaxed momentarily. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to twist away, but another person had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come up to hold her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take care of her," she heard.

"Bring her</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Against the rising sickness in her she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless.

It's a well known fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adamsite will cause a temporary mental de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression, as well as a sickness physically, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">since it smells just like coal gas, no one would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ever guess that it was present. Marion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">upset over Harry Johnson's death; it worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">making her try to commit suicide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hamilton Pine, who stood at the far end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room with Mr. Billings, said slowly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then you think that's how Johnson was</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed, too?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably," Duncan told him. "But I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">only guessing there. I know he used it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marion.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung his chair--Number Eight--invitingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Frazer. Not that he had anything against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garvey; it was just that Mr. Frazer, who was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">reputed to own a flock of Mexican gold mines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a liberal tipper; and when a guy is plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning on marrying a cute little manicurist like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tillie Brady, he has to look at things like that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips saw Mr. Frazer give him the nod and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped back politely, glanced down the gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing shop to where Tillie's fluffy golden head</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg><seg type="columnLine">86</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WILLIAM ROUGH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was bent demurely over a customer's hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She didn't notice Snips because she kept her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind on her work, and her nail file was brisk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips grinned happily, then stiffened. Lew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polio, the shop manager, had seen him glanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at Tillie, and the dapper man's dark eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittered hotly. He danced forward, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Frazer's plump arm and simpered, "Take</seg><seg type="columnLine">Number Four, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Frazer shrugged amiably and pulled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorite gag. "Long and fluffy on top, bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, sheik style around the ears." He was bald</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a golf ball.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The barbers tittered politely. Not Snips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His small, thin features were tight. His neat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft hands were knots at the sides of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">starched white coat. Lew Polio couldn't fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">him because Snips rated the job, after three</seg><seg type="columnLine">years in the army; but Lew was trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make things so miserable that Snips would</seg><seg type="columnLine">quit. By rights, Snips rated Chair Three. Lew</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stuck him at the end on Number Eight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneering that a thin-haired squirt was bad ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertising for any barber shop and Snips should</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep out of sight towards the back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lew steered every good tipper away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snips, made dirty cracks and wasn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">above bumping Snips' arm when he was shav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing someone and then hissing, "Butcher!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this was the blow-off. Snips started for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Lew wanted him to quit, so okay, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would. But he'd do it up brown--he'd smash</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lew's nose all over his olive-skinned puss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hard fingers closed on Snips' biceps. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house man, Garvey. "Shave," he grunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. "Snap it up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It still wouldn't have been enough to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snips, by itself; but just then Tillie finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">her party and looked up with a smile that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all for him. That stopped him. He guessed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would always make him catch his breath when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tillie smiled for him. She was blonde, blue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed, red-lipped, just five feet two and every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that he wanted. If he lost the job, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take just that much longer to get to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether a nest egg for Tillie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pulled his smarting eyes away from Lew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polio, slung a bib around Garvey's leathery</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck and stropped his razor, making the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">"slap-slap" the leather viciously. He caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. No use taking it out on the fine Swiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel. It was the keenest and best balanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">razor in the shop; a GI pal had picked it up</seg><seg type="columnLine">overseas for Snips. Snips hadn't got out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country himself. He'd cut hair at Camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pickett all the time, which made him a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">bashful about wearing his discharge button.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He carried it in his wallet, though, just in</seg><seg type="columnLine">case anybody doubted him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He brandished the razor, blurted wildly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wouldn't I just like to get Lew Polio under</seg><seg type="columnLine">this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh?" Garvey's shrewd eyes bored up at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him for_a second. Then Garvey laughed. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was funny--then!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips got Garvey out of the chair finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slid down the aisle to whisper to Tillie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Honey, that green smock makes you look like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a million." Lew Polio's glittering eyes fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him every inch of the way, but the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">said nothing t:.Il he was on his way up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel to shave Gordon Maxe, a bigshot guest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he stopped at Tillie's table and hissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">something. Tillie's eyes flashed wide. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft mouth trembled. Snips knew that Lew</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made another crack of some kind. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only one thing to do: poke Lew and take</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tillie out of this shop!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips would have raced after Lew and done</seg><seg type="columnLine">it right there, only he had someone in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. He no sooner got rid of him than an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other customer plopped down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Snips' scissors clicked, his razor flashed, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands dug the customer's scalp. While he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">working, the telephone rang. The shine boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered it, announced, "Fo' Mist' Garvey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That Mrs. Lockridge Burnard on twenty-two</seg><seg type="columnLine">say a fight goin' on outside her door."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Frazer whooped from under a hot towel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hurry it up, son 1 I gotta be a knight to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescue of my lady fair!" He laughed like it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a good one, and Snips recalled shop gos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sip about the wealthy, widowed Mrs. Burnard</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to buy a piece of Mr. Frazer's gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">mines. She'd had her cap set for Gordon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxe till Mr. Frazer showed up, then she'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It didn't mean anything to Snips. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisked the bib off his party and scooted down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Tillie. "Hon, what did. Lew say fo you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Forget it, Snipsy." But her smile was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You tell me!" Snips burst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you order me around! We're not</seg><seg type="columnLine">married yet!" Tillie flared. "Oh, all right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then. He said he wants a date with me to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night or he--he'll give me notice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips whirled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tillie squeaked, "Snipsy, what are you go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to doV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">4&lt;T&gt;UST Lew's nose and take you out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">here!" Snips yelled, shucking his white</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat, as he skidded back to his chair. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapped his razor into its case, shoved it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hip pocket; he knew he wouldn't be work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in this shop any more. He grabbed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">street coat, crammed his natty white Panama</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat down hard and charged through the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">that led up to the huge marble hotel lobby. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was five feet five, a hundred and forty pounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but people got out of his way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lew Polio would be finished shaving Gor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don Maxe by this time and had probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneaked down to his own room for a drink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or something. Snips barged into an elevator</seg><seg type="columnLine">DEAD MEN DdNT BLEED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cab, snapped, "Fifteen!" The elevator oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ator, Carl Pence, shuffled. "What you going</seg><seg type="columnLine">up there for, Snips?" He wore a natty blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunic and trousers, which failed to smarten up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pimpled face and receding chin. Snips</seg><seg type="columnLine">ddin't answer. His heels dug marks in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxurious carpeting when he sprang out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fifteenth floor. He got to Lew Polio's</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and spanked it with tight knuckles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no answer and Snips shouted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know you're in there! Open up!" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed the doorknob, rattled it. It gave. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opened--and, yes, Lew was inside, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. He'd be inside from now on--inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips didn't understand it right off. All he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw was Lew's crumpled figure on the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lew's white coat was mussed and awry. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark eyes were wide open. His olive skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pasty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips was paralyzed for a second, then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started forward. He didn't try to dive, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's what he did--headfirst into the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The reason was that he was helped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind. By a sap, or something equally brutal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It caught him behind the ear and he plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">into blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips dreamed that Tillie was giving him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a manicure. He felt liquid nail polish on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers. It wouldn't dry right, it seemed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally Tillie applied quick-drying fluid on top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it with little cotton swabs and then, of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, put the cotton in Snips' mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sputtered, tried to spit it out. It clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his lips, and the liquid on his fingers still</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't dry; it got sticky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he sat up and bleared at his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He groaned. What was wrong with Tillie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting red polish on a man's nails! Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would come off quick. Snips swiped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands on his pants. The polish wasn't dry, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, and wiped off easily. But it made sticky</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaks on the backs of his fingers and these</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up cotton. There was cotton still in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, too, dam it. Snips blew, saw a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it dance off his lips and float airily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He scowled. Who ever heard of a cotton</seg><seg type="columnLine">swab floating in the air? His eyes focussed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he understood: it wasn't cotton at all; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a feather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sure, there were feathers clinging to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, too. Now where in heck had they come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried to stand, slopped on his face. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed up on hands and knees and smelled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong aromatic odor of some kind. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it came from--Lew Polio's white bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber jacket. He couldn't help seeing. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only six inches from Lew now, and Lew</seg><seg type="columnLine">had red nail polish on his neck. Lots of red</seg><seg type="columnLine">nail polish, a crimson lake of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mother Mary!" Snips burst and put all</seg><seg type="columnLine">hfe strength into pushing away. He fell back,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled to his feet, lungs laboring. It wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mil polish on Lew Polio's neck at all--it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">red,' red blood! It came from a gash that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a semi-circle under Lew's chin from</seg><seg type="columnLine">jawline to jawline. Someone had cut Lew's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Snips caught at the bed to keep from floun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dering. It seemed that there was no place to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">put his feet except in blood and feathers. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">room was a shambles, as if a rugged fight had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taken place, and the feathers came from a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bursted pillow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They were strewn all over the carpet and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">furniture. The free ones swirled in the air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">currents, but the ones that had touched the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">red liquid, especially under Lew's chin, had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stuck and clung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Snips' breathing stopped, then he gagged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He'd heard of men being tarred and feathered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--Lew Polio was bloodied and feathered!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ships wanted out--fast! He lurched toward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the door. Then he saw it. The razor beside</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lew's body. His razor!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Snips clutched at his hip pocket, but it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wasn't necessary. He knew that the razor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">couldn't be in two places at the same time. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it was on the floor beside Lew, it couldn't be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in its case. Nor was it. Snips spied the case</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">across the room. He felt numb. Lew's throat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had been slashed with Snips' own razor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The door crashed open behind Snips. Gar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vey's gravel voice ordered, "Don't move,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">boy!" A second later, he grunted, "McGlynn,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I'll be damned! You meant it when you said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you'd like to cut his throat!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No!" Snips screamed. "I didn't! I didn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mean it and I didn't do it He was like that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when I came in! Only his throat wasn't cut 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Hagh!" Garvey spat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Snips wailed, "Honest, Garvey! Somebody</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knocked me out and used my razor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You admit it's your razor?" Garvey shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You'd find out, anyhow," Snips gulped. "I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had it in my pocket. I was going to quit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">working at the shop, so I brought it along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Garvey sandpapered a leathery cheek</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully. "That's it, then. You came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to even things with Lew before you quit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The room here says you had a good fight. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to get the best of you and you pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the razor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ARVEY nodded, satisfied. Snips trembled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   He was caught sweet. Garvey, or any cop</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for that matter, would swear he had motive,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">opportunity and the weapon. The best lawyer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the country couldn't argue those away, even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if Snips put himself in debt for years to hire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Garvey said glumly, "Open and shut, dam-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mit ! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Snips' brain whirled. Garvey once had run</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. his own detective agency but hadn't made out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WILLIAM ROUGH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He was biding his time as house dick here at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Colony Plaza, hoping for a big case so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he'd get his name in the pagers and be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to capitalize on it and start up for himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Garvey!" Snips blurted. "Listen, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrest me, the case'll be closed right away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There won't be any publicity for you at all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But if you let me get away and then catch me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it'll be better for you. Honest to Gawd I won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">run out on you. I'll meet you anywhere you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, just so I get a chance to find the guy</seg><seg type="columnLine">who really did this. Will you do it, Garvey?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Please!" •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The house dick's eyes flickered. Snips could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that Garvey was weighing the proposition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Honest, Garvey, I'll keep in touch with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you!" Snips promised. "What brought you</seg><seg type="columnLine">up here, anyhow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Garvey grunted. "Somebody called down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said there was noise here. I didn't hurry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had another call about noise from Mrs. Burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard a while back and there was no sign of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I got to her floor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there wasn't any noise here," Snips</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried. "Look! The furniture is turned over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it's not broken. There wasn't any fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lew was out cold on the floor when I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and the room was okay. Somebody slugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, then made it look like there'd been a fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cut Lew's throat. It must have happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way! Give me a fair shake, Garvey."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Garvey's gun hand relaxed a little. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowned,' still trying to make up his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please!" Snips pleaded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Garvey scowled, shook his head. "Nup.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Can't do. I want a build up, not down. They'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride hell out of me for letting a squirt like</seg><seg type="columnLine">you lam."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips clenched his fists, opened his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to argue some more. He closed it, felt his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders sag. It was no use. He was licked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" he yelled--and jumped Garvey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was operating on instinct now. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to use his head and it hadn't worked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His fists were all that were left. He wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">big, but he was compact and wiry, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength in his wrists and forearms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Too. Garvey wasn't expecting action and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had eased up. There was more surprise than</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain in his first, "Oof!" as Snips' left hooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his jaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips felt his knuckles on the bone of Gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vey's face, struck again. The house man spat</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curse, pulled back and slashed out with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun barrel. It raked Snips' collar bone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips bleated in pain, felt himself careen</seg><seg type="columnLine">off balance and start down. He flung out both</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, trying to grab Garvey anywhere. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed Garvey's waist and chest, but his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still out in a half circle when his knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit the floor. His soft, but strong, hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraped down Garvey's thighs. Snips felt the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man's legs getting thinner as he dropped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. When he got to Garvey's ankles, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were thin enough to hang onto. Snips hung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he felt Garvey lurch. He yanked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">both Garvey's ankles. Garvey spilled back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards. The floor shook as the house cop's</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam hit it He howled and thrashed around.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snips sent strength to his knees and came up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He kicked just once, straight and true, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent Garvey's .38 clunking across the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he made tracks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out the door, down the corridor. Down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first flight of front stairs. Around the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor on the next landing and back to the serv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice stairs. Snips knew the hotel layout of old.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was twisting and backtracking instinctive-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly but driving ever closer to the ground floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">exits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER TWO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Helping Hand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HPHEN it hit him: he'd started on the fif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teenth floor. All Garvey had needed to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">was call the desk and warn the other house</seg><seg type="columnLine">cops. They'd be deployed in the lobby and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even at the rear of the hotel, and one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">them would be outside wising up the patrol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in the vicinity. The second Snips put</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot outside, if he got that far, he'd be shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">at or slugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He cowered on a staircase. He had to bide</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hotel, at least till the hunt died down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What else could he do?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His breathing, he knew, was loud enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attract attention from anyone near him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to stop it, control it, but it was no good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By a miracle, his white Panama hat hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid off through it all; it was because he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have much hair and he always pulled it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight. He took it off now, held it over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth to cut down the wheeze of his lungs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It didn't help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They think I'm on the way down!* he</seg><seg type="columnLine">panted. "I'll go «^!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reversed his field, pumped back up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs. One flight. Two flights. He was back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on twelve again. There was no thirteenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor in a hotel, so the next one was numbered</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourteen. Snips halted, flesh crawling. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't risk passing fifteen again: the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be alive with house cops. He shivered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where could a guy hide? One of the rooms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, but which one ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips breathed, "Mr. Frazer lives in 14071</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he's not in! " The jolly, bald man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the barber shop to go to Mrs. Bumard's</seg><seg type="columnLine">suite on twenty-two, Snips remembered. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't think any further than that Mr. Frazer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the kind of guy who'd leave his door un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked, too. All Snips wanted was sanctuary</seg><seg type="columnLine">till his heart stopped pounding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">DEAD MEN DON'T BLEED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He scuttled up the remaining steps to four-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen, scanned the corridor, found it empty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid down to 1407. The door was unlocked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snips went into the suite like a gopher whisk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into a hole. He leaned his shivery back</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the door and tried to keep his remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing strength from dribbling away. His lungs</seg><seg type="columnLine">made harsh laboring sounds, tlien quieted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, and something suspiciously like a sob</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickled from his parched lips. What was he</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do now?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His knees were too wobbly to support him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He flopped in a chair. There was no meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it, yet he'd been framed for Lew Polio's</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder. Why? Why would anyone want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill Lew in the first place? That the killer</seg><seg type="columnLine">would frame someone who didn't get along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Lew was understandable enough, but why</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill him in the first place? Miserable as Lew</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been, he hadn't seemed the type to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat cut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Unless there was something crooked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him being flush lately," Snips mumbled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. Lew made a good salary as shop</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager, but the past few weeks he'd been</seg><seg type="columnLine">spending plenty. He'd bought new suits and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken a suite here in the hotel, and he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought a new car. "He must have been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">something crooked," Snips nodded. "He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a fight, or something, with the guys he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it with and they rubbed him out, then saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance to frame me and did it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips nodded vigorously. After Lew had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaved Gordon Maxe and come to his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, he'd met someone who had slugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. This someone had either stayed inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room or waited around outside and, see-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Snips stomp up to Lew's door, had got-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten him, then cut Lew's throat with Snips'</seg><seg type="columnLine">razor and faked a fight scene which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty realistic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips recalling the bloody feathers, shivered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw three or four of them still clinging to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jacket and pants. He snatched them off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw that his hands were still sticky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though there wasn't too much blood on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing. He started for the bathroom to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stuff cleaned off. He brushed the red-dyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathers into the commode. One of them missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Snips picked it out of the air, felt it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween thumb and forefinger. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">clanged warningly in his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fingered the feather, searched his pants</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another, found one in a cuff. He com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared the two. One was dry and clean and</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly brittle. The other seemed more pliable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moistish and soiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TT WAS important. Snips knew, without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> quite knowing why. He cudgeled his brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the answer but couldn't grasp it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped the feathers in a handkerchief start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to wash up. He was a little steadier now,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which was lucky--for suddenly a nattily uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed man had come up behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips saw the man's pimpled face and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceding chin in the mirror over the washbowl</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the man jumped him. It was Carl Pence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elevator operator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gotcha, Snips!" Carl yelled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips had a liar of soap in his hand. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhed around and smacked it wetly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pimples. He missed the first time and Carl</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pence opened his mouth in a laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips jabbed out again with the bar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">soap. It traveled straight and true and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rammed into Carl's mouth, right back to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonsils. Carl tried to choke it out, failed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clawed at it He had only one hand free.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snips batted it aside and whipped a stinger to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carl's stomach. That kicked the soap out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carl's mouth, together with a tortured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ughl-1-1!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You want-more, Carl?" Snips challenged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking clean and cocking his fists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carl shrank away, blubbering soapy saliva</seg><seg type="columnLine">that drooled down on his neat blue tunic. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no effort to continue brawling. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked at Snips as if he'd bitten off more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he could chew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips stuck out his chest. He wasn't used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to such respect. "Punk!" he leered at Carl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How did you know I was in Mr. Frazer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">suite?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't, honest!" Carl snatched a towel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swabbed his chin. His pale eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">skittery. "I just came in to see Mr. Frazer</seg><seg type="columnLine">about . . . something. I seen you here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the cops are after you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you thought you'd be a big shot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nab me," Snips cut in. "You thought I'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy. What did you want to see Mr. Frazer</seg><seg type="columnLine">about?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carl eyed the door, took a step toward it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snips stepped in front of him, fists ready.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tell me, smart guy," he ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carl bit his lip. "Garvey thinks maybe Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frazer heard you in the barber shop when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you threatened to cut Lew's throat. I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd come up and get Mr. Frazer, is all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips cried, "I didn't threaten to cut Lew's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat! I was just burned up and made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack! Jeez, a guy don't have a chance! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He quivered. This was always what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened when you shot off your mouth. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, he knew what it was like to hate cops</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the way they built up a case against you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garvey would get fat, jolly Mr. Frazer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swear he had heard the threat, and Mr. Frazer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just the kind of guy a jury would cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly believe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips burst, "But a jury would believe Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frazer if he was for me, too! I gotta see him</seg><seg type="columnLine">first!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips started to turn, remembered Carl. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't let Carl walk out and run for Garvey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WILLIAM ROUGH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He wet his lips. "Hey, look at yourself in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror, Carl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh?" Carl turned curiously. Snips hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">him behind the ear smartly with the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stiff palm. He'd never had any jiu jitsui</seg><seg type="columnLine">training himself, but he'd seen other GI's</seg><seg type="columnLine">practising it and had wanted to try it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched Carl Pence crumple. "Boy," he mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veled, "it sure works!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was going to let Carl lay and just lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bathroom door. But Mr. Frazer was up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Mrs. Burnard's suite on the twenty-second</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, and Snips had to get up there without</seg><seg type="columnLine">attracting attention. He peeked out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor, saw Carl's elevator cab with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door open, and went back and pulled off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's blue uniform coat and trousers. He got</seg><seg type="columnLine">into them himself, dragged Carl out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathroom to a bedroom closet and tied him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Mr. Frazer's shoe laces. A few moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">later he was zooming up in the elevator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He skinned the car doors open on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-second floor and rapped on 2212. Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lockridge Burnard opened the door herself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was small, blonde, well-dressed, and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second Snips hoped that Tillie would hold up</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well when she was fifty. Then Mrs. Burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard said, "Yes?" and looked back over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and giggled, and Snips changed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. He didn't want Tillie ever to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">coy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said, "Is Mr. Frazer here, ma'am? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotta see him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Burnard's brows climbed. Snips de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided they were much too dark and slinky;</seg><seg type="columnLine">she didn't spare the make-up. "Really," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR. FRAZER'S voice boomed, "Yowsuh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm here, son. What do you want?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snips slid past the woman. She looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">petulantly at Frazer. "Horace, can't we be</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shucks, honey, the kid's in trouble," Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frazer said. "Bet he's got the same kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble as us--he's in love."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Burnard tittered. "The poor thing!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snips blurted, "That's not all of it, though!</seg><seg type="columnLine">They think I cut Lew Polio's throat! They</seg><seg type="columnLine">want you to testify that you heard me say I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it in the barber shop, Mr. Frazer. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't, will you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Burnard screamed, "Horace--how</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful! Call the police!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sh'h!" Mr. Frazer's pink jowls were</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave. "Now what's this all about?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips rushed through his story while Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burnard fluttered and gasped. Mr. Frazier</seg><seg type="columnLine">polished his bald head with a lavender hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerchief no bigger than a bath mat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said, "Well, son, I didn't hear you</seg><seg type="columnLine">threaten to cut this Polio's throat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips gulped, "Gee, thanks. I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. "Frazier frowned. "But I don't see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it'll do much good. Your best bet it to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself up and--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wouldn't have a chance!" Snips bleated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've got to find something that will clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Horace, I'm going to call the police I" Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burnard cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hush, Lambykins," Mr. Frazier cajoled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The boy is innocent. We've got to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">him." He pinched his jowls thoughtfully. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">bet Gordon Maxe would know what to do."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Horace!" Mrs. Burnard protested. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know I dislike that man! You said yourself</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he wasn't to be trusted. Remember ? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspected that he was just being nice to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sell me stock in a worked-out gold mine."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"True, true," Mr. Frazer admitted. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew him in Mexico and he's had legal ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience--so long as we're on guard against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him we're safe.' He turned to Snips. "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, son, and we'll see Mr. Maxe. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewd, and he'll advise you what to do just</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hope that it will put him in solid with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and Mrs. Burnard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips licked his lips. He didn't know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do. But when Mr. Frazer slung a friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm over his shoulders and steered him</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the door, he went along. Mr. Frazer</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the right idea, maybe. You can't always</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out of trouble by yourself; you've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look for men who know the ropes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's on twenty-eight," Mr. Frazer said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the corridor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got an elevator," Snips said. "I met</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carl Pence, the operator, in your suite, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-- Please don't get sore--I tied him up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your closet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Frazer's jaws could get hard, in spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their fat. "I don't know as I like that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">son," he growled. "What were either one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you doing in my place?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I went there to hide," Snips said apol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ogetically. "He said he came up to take you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Garvey as a witness against me. I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">let him walk out then, could I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But they'll notice his elevator isn't run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning and--" Mr. Frazer broke off, eyeing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevator indicators. One of them hovered at</seg><seg type="columnLine">22 even now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips saw it and jerked, looked wildly up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down the corridor. The door of a mop</seg><seg type="columnLine">closet was a great deal closer than the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vator bank. Snips dived for it, hissing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe somebody's coming to see why the cab</seg><seg type="columnLine">is stuck on this floor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was right. He'd no sooner pulled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">closet door nearly shut than an elevator</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator got out of his cab and peered at Carl</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pence's car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, mister," the man called to Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frazer, "seen anything of the guy who runs</seg><seg type="columnLine">this crate?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">DEAD MEN DONT BLEED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, son, I haven't," Mr. Frazer replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The elevator operator sighed, "He'll get</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell for loafing around. I'U report his cab</seg><seg type="columnLine">up here. Everything happens at once, don't it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">A barber cuts a guy's throat; they catch a guy</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealing chickens in the kitchen; and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">cops all over the place Carl has to lay down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the job."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man clanged his doors again. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frazer caded softly, "Okay, son."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER THREE</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jaws of the Trap</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T&gt;UT Snips' head was whirling. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">was trying to click into place. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mention of chickens being stolen in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen that had tightened him up. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sense to it, yet some deep intuition was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. Snips shook his head. The feathers</seg><seg type="columnLine">all around Lew Polio's body must have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him sensitive to anything that smacked of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, such as chickens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurry, son," Mr. Frazer urged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yessir." Snips started out of the closet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">skidded a little, caught himself. He saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd slipped on white powder that had spilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a can of deodorant. He smelled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar tang of the strong aromatic odor, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wasn't until he and Mr. Frazer were shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up in the elevator that it connected. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurted, "Why that's the same stuff I smelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Lew Polio's coat in the room when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whassat, son?" Mr. Frazer said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips shook his head. "I don't know, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest. There's something I should be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to figure out, but I can't. What was going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside Mrs. Burnard's suite when she called</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Garvey?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Frazies waved carelessly. "She said</seg><seg type="columnLine">she heard a fight there, but no one saw any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing and she hadn't looked out herself. Here's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxe's floor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips tried to swallow the lump under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue as he followed Mr. Frazer to 2805. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to trust someone, he supposed, but he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seen this Gordon Maxe and Mr. Frazer</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself had told Mrs. Bumard that Maxe was</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to promote phony mine stock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Frazer opened the door, calling, "Gor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don 1 " There was no answer and the fat man</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered into the bedroom, came back frowning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maxe must have stepped out, son," he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snips. "M'm, but we can't leave that ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vator car on this floor or someone will come</seg><seg type="columnLine">snooping. Suppose you wait here while I get</seg><seg type="columnLine">rid of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips swallowed. "All r-right, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Frazer waddled toward the^corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">door again, paused. "Another thing," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully. "We can't let Carl Pence stay</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tied up in my suite. Tell you what, he can</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably be bought, can't he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good," Mr. Frazer said. "If I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help you, I want to do it right. Shuck out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that uniform, son, and I'll untie Pence and give</seg><seg type="columnLine">it back to him. I'll pay him to keep his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut for a couple hours at least and bring your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own clothes up here to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Snips hesitated. It sounded logical, yet . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Frazer advised, "Maybe Mr. Maxe will</seg><seg type="columnLine">think your best bet is to get out of the hotel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you wouldn't get far in that uniform</seg><seg type="columnLine">without somebody spotting you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the clinching argument. Snips pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the natty blue tunic, stepped out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trousers. Mr. Frazer scooped them up. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxe comes back before I do, son, just tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him your story and that I brought you here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keep your chin out now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Frazer shut the door. Snips stood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of the sitting room in his jockey</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorts and shirt. He shivered, but not from</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of clothing. He realized that he'd en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted Mr. Frazer with his fate, and every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing now depended on the fat man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was Gordon Maxe, too. Snips won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered again what kind of man Maxe was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe he'd refuse to help. Maybe he'd take</seg><seg type="columnLine">one look at Snips and call Garvey. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frazer seemed like a jovial sort who'd give a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man a hand, but that didn't prove Maxe would.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing to do but wait and see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snips paced back and forth. He felt like look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for a dressing gown or something, but if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxe came in and saw him wearing his cloth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it might rub him the wrong way. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">best thing was to look helpless, maybe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was no trick to looking helpless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snips knew. That was exactly how he felt. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried again to figure out what had tightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">him up earlier when the elevator operator</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had come looking for Carl had men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned chickens being stolen in the kitchen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he had an idea. He went to the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone and called the barber shop, asked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tillie. When she answered, then gasped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, honey, I'm so worried about you!" Snips</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt ashamed that he hadn't got in touch with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sooner. She certainly had known that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being hunted as a murderer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">W'TILLIE, I didn't do it!" he gulped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    "Whatever they say, I didn't do it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Honey, I know you didn't! I trust you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snipsy! But what did happen? Where are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips said automatically, "I'm in Gordon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxe's suite, hon. I've been framed for Lew's</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder. I want you to do something for me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Find out what happened in the kitchen, will</seg><seg type="columnLine">you? Somebody stole chickens, I think, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out. See who it was and what's going on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">92</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WILLIAM ROUGH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hon. Hurry! Call me back here, or I'll call</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll do it, Snipsy, but--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips didn't hear the rest. He sensed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor door opening, saw a lean black shoe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">string of a man slipping in and pronged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone. He kept his hand on it, though.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the only weapon handy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stuttered, "Y-you're--Are you Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxe?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's deep-sunk dark eyes were glitter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing coals. His lipst under a slash of black</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustache, scarcely moved as he purred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's the name I'm using at the present,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes." His gaze raked Snips' bare shanks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you are our little patsy, I take it. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">met Frazer outside and he told me he left you</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. You'll do nicely, little man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ill do--nicely!" Snips cried. "I'm your</seg><seg type="columnLine">patsy! I d-don't know what you m-meanl"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lean dark man snicked the lock on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door with a flat, metallic sound. He came</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Snips, his long thin arms flexing like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feelers on a skinny black bug. The deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">grooves running from the corners of his thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips to his nostrils told that he was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">young, yet his hair was black and thick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said silkily, "Don't you understand, little</seg><seg type="columnLine">man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips started to breath faster. "I do under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand. I understand some of it, anyhow. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mr. Frazer are in something together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Burnard said that Mr. Frazer told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to trust you, but that was just a gag. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me right up here for some reason."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxe grinned. "An old dodge, but still</seg><seg type="columnLine">effective," he said. "Frazer throws suspicion</seg><seg type="columnLine">on me and Mrs. Burnard thinks he rescued</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and trusts him more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips' nerves were screaming, but he could-</seg><seg type="columnLine">n't move. "You and Frazer are after Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burnard's money! " he squeaked. " But where</seg><seg type="columnLine">did Lew Polio come in? You killed him, didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, not at all," Maxe murmured. "Mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der is a crime. You killed Polio. You slit</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat. Garvey found you right there</seg><seg type="columnLine">but let you get away--I should have slugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">you harder, little man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips felt goose pimples on his bare arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shoulders. He crouched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Careful," Maxe warned. Leisurely, he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a compact revolver from under his should :r,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slanted it at Snips. "It will look as if you got</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from Garvey," he explained softly, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Carl Pence spotted you and tried to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and you pushed him out of a window."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snips choked, "Pushed him out of a win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow 1 That's a lie! I tied him up in Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frazer's suite, and he's still there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maxe glanced at the watch on his skinny</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist. "Suppose you look out the window."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snipa-stared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead," Maxe encouraged. "Frazer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">had enough time to get back to his suite and</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snips was fascinated. He moved jerkily</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the window, opened it. Twenty-eight stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">below a crowd had gathered in the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">huddling around a motionless thing on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pavement. The thing had been human but</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now pulp. Snips couldn't make out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pimpled face and receding chin but he recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized Carl Pence's natty blue uniform. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut his bugging eyes hard, pushed away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maxe said regretfully, "If only it weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowding things, I could have shoved you on</seg><seg type="columnLine">out after him just now. As it is, I want to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while so it'll look as if you couldn't stand i</seg><seg type="columnLine">being hunted and cracked up and jumped."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snips pressed his fists against his temples</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all his might. "Why did you have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill Carl?" he husked. "He was only an de-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">vator boy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maxe's thin shoulders moved negligently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I lined him up the first day I was in the hotel j</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a kid who'd like to make a dollar. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">I needed an elevator today, I buzzed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed some dough in front of him and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CNIPS cried, "You needed an elevator to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take Lew Polio from the mop closet on</seg><seg type="columnLine">22 to his room on 15! That's itl Yeah I And</seg><seg type="columnLine">later on when Carl saw me go to Lew's room</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reported to you. You hurried down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slugged me and framed me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maxe stroked his thick black mustache with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a yellow thumbnail. "Pence was up to his;</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck the minute he let me use his elevator,*</seg><seg type="columnLine">After that he had to string along. The fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungled when he stole the chicken, though,,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I knew that the minute the Johns worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him he'd sing.

The Colony Plaza was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a well constructed building.

Snips opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaving kit absently.

Maxe went limp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was mouthing hot words, cursing Maxe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and holding him tight as tight.

He did it, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he hadn't been overseas, he'd had Basic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Training and knew how to shoot. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun up, butt in his hand which was hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor, and shot three times from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">position. All lie had to do was aim at the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way because Frazer filled it. Then the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way was empty again and the fat man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">huddled over on his knees, holding his clasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands around his middle.

"That's just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about right. Only later on Lew got wise and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that there was big money involved. He want-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ed a cut of that, but you tried to put him off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He got sore and said he'd squawk to Mrs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Burnard. You thought he was bluffing, but he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wasn't. And today was the day he got fed up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and started for Mrs. Burnard's suite to spill it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You must have seen that he was sorer than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">usual and followed him. When you saw that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he was really heading for Mrs. Burnard's, you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slugged him, right outside the door. She re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ported a fight, but when Garvey got there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the corridor was empty. 'Cause why? 'Cause</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you'd dragged Lew into the mop closet till you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had time to move him. Say no!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Maxe's mouth hardened. Snips drew his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lips back on his teeth in a horrible grimace,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brought the razor down slowly, flicked Maxe's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Wait! Don't! I'll talk!" Maxe blubbered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You're right! I didn't mean to kill him, damn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him! I guess I just hit him too hard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yeah," Snips agreed. "I knew Lew had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been parked in that mop closet because there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were deodorant crystals spilled there and he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had the same smell on his coat. It meant that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he'd been in that closet and had been flat on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his back at the time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Snips settled himself comfortably on Maxe's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stomach. "The rest of it is simple. You hired</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Carl Pence and used his elevator to take</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lew's body to his room. You left him there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and probably intended to let it go. But then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Carl saw me heading for Lew's room and told</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you, and you saw a chance to frame me. You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came down and slugged me. My razor fell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out of my pocket I was a barber. Why not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">make it a good frame and cut Lew's throat?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You did, but you forgot that dead men don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bleed!''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Snips wagged his head sadly. "It must have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been something to cut a guy's throat and not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">see any blood come out, but Lew had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dead long enough by that time for the blood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to stop flowing in him. You were in a spot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You couldn't sew his neck back together again,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so all that was left was to get some blood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">somehow. With Carl Pence knowing the ropes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around the hotel, you saw how it could be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">worked. Carl got a live chicken from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">storeroom off the kitchen and you bled it over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lew Polio's throat and body. Am I right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Maxe shrank away from the razor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Y-yeah."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Snips looked triumphantly at Garvey. "Is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that enough?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Garvey stepped forward. "That's plenty,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">DEAD MEN DON'T BLEEP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lie said. "And I recognize this bird now. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted in a couple of states."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maxe jerked, cursed. Snips banged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's head on the floor, said, "But somebody</seg><seg type="columnLine">spotted Carl when he stole the chicken, or any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the guy he gave it to was caught. Carl</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the chicken back downstairs in a pillow</seg><seg type="columnLine">slip so as not to get blood on himself. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get rid of the chicken and didn't want it</seg><seg type="columnLine">found around the kitchen. There's always</seg><seg type="columnLine">guys hanging around the kitchen for handouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stuff, and Carl just handed the chicken to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them. But the guy was caught beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and Carl knew the guy could identify him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He hurried up to Frazer's suite to ask what</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do. That's where I got him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, some of the feathers pulled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the chicken when they were bleeding it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lew's body, and in order to cover them up as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as get the pillow slip to take the bloody</seg><seg type="columnLine">chicken away in, they busted a pillow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw the feathers all over. I noticed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the feathers were different than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. These soft pillows are filled with either</seg><seg type="columnLine">duck or goose feathers--not chicken feathers."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snips told Garvey, "Maxe is the one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed Lew Polio. You heard him admit it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Frazer is the one who pushed Carl Pence</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the window. As soon as Frazer heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Mrs. Burnard had reported a disturbance</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside her door, he got in touch with Maxe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out what had happened, and they worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">together from then on. I guess that's enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make it stick, huh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Garvey yanked on his handcuffs. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty, kid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You take the credit," Snips said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Garvey's leathery face brightened.
