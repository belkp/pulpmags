                    <ab>Science Finds New Way to Remove Germ Cause and Activate Dormant Roots to Grow New Hair.</ab>
                    <ab>(Read Free Offer)</ab>
                    <ab>A germ called "Flask Bacilla of Unna" gets deep into the scalp skin in many cases of abnormal hair deficiency, causing a most
                        dangerous type of dandruff. It clogs up pores and hair follicles, causing itchy scalp, falling hair and prevents dormant hair
                        roots (papilla) from growing new hair. The germ is seldom suspected. Washing and shampooing and use of tonics, ointments and
                        lotions don't remove the cause. They merely cleanse and treat the surface and roll off the outer skin like water rolls off the
                        back of duck. No wonder baldness is increasing.</ab>
                    <ab>Now a new discovery enables people who have dandruff, falling hair, thin hair and baldness to harmlessly romove the congested,
                        thin outer layer of scalp skin. This permits opened pores to breathe in air, sunshine and absorb a penetrating, stimulating
                        scalp-food to activate the smothered, dormant hair roots and grow new hair. It is the most sensational discovery in the
                        history of falling hair and baldness. It is all explained in a new treatise called "GROW HAIR," showing "anatomy of your hair"
                        and tells what to do. This treatise is now being mailed FREE to all who write for it. Send no money, just name and address to
                        Dermolav Lab., Desk H 381, No. 1700 Broadway, New York, N. Y., and you get If by return mall free and postpaid. If pleased,

                        work. No more "penny pinching". Have money to help pay your nagging bills- buy clothing- pay off the mortgage- buy yourself a
                        home- put money in the bank or what- ever your heart desires. That's the kind of a business opportunity I am offering
                        you.</ab>
                    <ab>TEA AND COFFEE ROUTES PAY BEST</ab>
                    <ab>Everybody knows there is noth- ing better than a good weekly route for a fine, steady income. These Tea and Coffee Routes pay
                        far better than most because you supply nearly 300 products- things people use daily in order to live. You simply take care of
                        cus- tomers' orders on the route in your lo- cality. You collect all the cash and keep a big share of it just for looking
                        after the or-ders, delivering the goods, and taking care of the busi- ness. I furnish you with hun- dreds of fine premiums and
                        special bargain offers premiums to give away with Tea, Coffee, Spices, Ex- tracts, linking Powder and other fine products.
                        Hundreds are now waiting to be served in many lo- calities. Daily and weekly earn- ings mount steadily where you call on your
                        route regularly.</ab>

                    <ab>When I send you instructions for making money on my new neigh- borhood Tea and Coffee Route Plan I also give you rock-bottom
                        whole-sale prices on your own groceries and household necessities. This is in addition to your regular daily earnings, so you
                        make big money in cash and save big money on the things you use in your home.</ab>

                        people earn more money at once. You can have one of these good paying routes right in your own locality right near where you

                    <ab>EXPERIENCE OR TRAINING UNNECESSARY</ab>
                    <ab>I am not nearly as much interested in your past experience as I am in your will- ingness to follow a few plain instructions
                        that will tell you the inside workings of this profitable business. I will ex- plain just how you go about placing Tea,
                        Coffee, Spices, Extracts and Household Prod- ucts with the customers on your route. I furnish everything. There is no stock to
                        carry- you fill your orders from my big factory stock. You have entire charge of everything.</ab>

                    <ab>STOP cheating yourself out of musical good times. Stop thinking that learning music is nothing but one grinding session of
                        monotonous exercises after another . . . days, months and years of difficult technique under the thumb of a private

                        letter. Plenty of clear instructions tell you how each bar is played lots of diagram pictures show you how, then you do it
                        yourself and hear it. Everything to make learning a joy. In fact, the U. S. School of Music has made the reading and play- ing
                        of music so simple that you don't have to know one note from another to begin.</ab>

                        Rundown Men And Women</ab>
                    <ab>"I have been underweight for years." says Miss Taylor. "And after two packages of Kelp-a-Malt have gained "well over five lbs.
                        and am a new person inside and out. Am elated with Kelp-a-Malt."</ab>
                    <ab>"Had stomach trouble for years. When I take Kelp-a-Malt I have a hearty appe- tite for everything and suffer no distress.
                        Kelp-a-.Malt has banished constipation, which I have had all my life." -W.D.C.</ab>
                    <ab>. . . "Gained 8 pounds with one package of Kelp-a-Malt and feel 100% better." Mrs. W. J. S.</ab>
                    <ab>Just a few of the thousands of actual testimonials that are flooding in from all over the country telling us how this newer
                        form of food iodine is building firm flesh, strengthening the nerves, enriching the blood- nourishing vital glands and making
                        weak, pale, careworn, underweight men and women look and feel years younger.</ab>
                    <ab>Scientists have recently discovered that the blood, liver and vital glands of the body contain definite quantities of iodine
                        which heretofore has been difficult to ob-tain.</ab>
                    <ab>Modern foodstuffs, even fresh vegetables and similarly so-called "good" foods, have recently been discovered to be often
                        lacking not only in food iodine but in all the other essential organic minerals without which strength and health are
                        impossible.</ab>
                    <ab>Kelp-a-Malt, only recently discovered, is an amazingly rich source of food iodine, along with practically every mineral
                        essential to normal well-being. It is a sea vegeta-ble concentrate taken from the Pacific Ocean and made available in
                        palatable, pleasant-to-take tablet form. Six Kelp-a-Malt tab- lets provide more food iodine than 486 pounds of spinach, 1,600
                        pounds of beef, 1,387 pounds of lettuce. Three Kelp-a-Malt tablets contain more iron and copper for rich blood, vitality and
                        strength than a pound of spinach, 7 1/2 pounds of fresh to- matoes more calcium than 6 eggs, more phosphorous than a pound and
                        a half of car- rots sulphur, sodium, potassium and other essential minerals.</ab>
                    <ab>Only when you get an adequate amount of these minerals can your food do you any good- can you nourish glands, add weight,
                        strengthen your nerves, increase your vigor, vitality and endurance.</ab>
                    <ab>Try Kelp-a-Malt for a single week. Watch your appetite improve, firm flesh ap-pear instead of scrawny hollows. Feel the
                        tireless vigor and vitality it brings you. It not only improves your looks, but your health as well. It corrects sour, acid
                        stomach, Gas, indigestion and all the usual distress commonly experienced by the undernourished and the underweight disappear.

                    <ab>Kill Kidney Acids</ab>
                    <ab>Don't Take Drastic Drugs</ab>
                    <ab>You have 9 million tiny tubes or filters in your Kidneys, which are at work night and day cleaning out Acids and poisonous
                        wastes and purifying your blood, which circulates thorugh your kidneys 200 times an hour. So it's no wonder that poorly
                        functioning Kidneys may be the real cause of feeling tired, run-down, nervous, Get- ting Up Nights, Rheumatic Pains and other
                        troubles.</ab>
                    <ab>Nearly everyone is likely to suffer from poorly functioning Kidneys at times because modern foods and drinks, weather changes,
                        exposure, colds, nervous strain, worry and over-work often place an extra heavy load on the Kidneys.</ab>
                    <ab>But when your Kidneys need help, don't take chances with drastic or irritating drugs. Be careful. If poorly functioning
                        Kidneys or Bladder make you suffer from Getting Up Nights, Leg Pains, Nervousness, Stiffness, Burning, Smarting, Itching

                    <ab>City Health Doctor Praises Cystex</ab>
                    <ab>Doctors and druggists everywhere approve of the prescription Cystex because of its splendid ingredients and quick action. For
                        instance. Dr. W. R. George, graduate Med- ical Dept., University of Indiana, former Health Commissioner or Indianapolis, and
                        Med- ical Director for insur- ance company 10 years, recently wrote the fol- lowing letter: "There is little ques- tion but
                        what properly functioning Kidney and Bladder organs are vital to the health. Insuf- ficient Kidney excre- tions are the cause
                        of much needless suffering with aching back, weak- ness, painful joints and rheumatic pains, headaches and a general run-down,
                        ex- hausted body. This condition also in- terferes with normal rest at night by caus- ing the sufferer to rise frequently for
                        relief, and results in painful excretion, itching, smarting and burning. I am of the opinion that Cystex definitely corrects
                        frequent causes (poor kidney functions) of such con- ditions and I have actually prescribed in my own practice for many years
                        past the same ingredients contained in your formula. Cys- tex not only exerts a splendid influence in flushing poisons from
                        the urinary tract, but also has an antiseptic action and assists in freeing the blood or retained toxins. Be- lieving as I do
                        that so meritorious a prod- uct deserves the endorsement of the Medical Profession, I am happy indeed to lend my name and
                        photograph for your use in adver-tising Cystex." Signed W. R. George, M. D.</ab>

                    <ab>I'll do for you exactly what I did for myself. I was once a 97--pound weakling. I was sickly, only half alive. I had a fabby
                        namby-pamby body.</ab>
                    <ab>How I changed myself from this "below average" physique into the man who won against all comers the title of "World's Most
                        Perfectly Developed Man" is an absorbing story. It is told in my book. "Everlasting Health and Strength." which I will send

                    <ab>It's Easy MY WAY</ab>
                    <ab>Big claims mean nothing! That is why I offer you more than promis[e]s. That is why I offer you a 7 days trial of my famous
                        method. Dynamic-Tension. That lets you see for yourself that I back up every promise I make. That PROVES beyond a flicker of a
                        doubt that I can and will turn you, too, into a vital, powerful NEW MAN.</ab>
                    <ab>Thousands of fellows all over The world have used my method- and now you can, too. Like them, you can put on firm layers of
                        muscle where you need them most, tone up your whole system, banish consti- pation, poor digestion, bad breath, pimples and
                        other conditions that rob you of the good things and good times of life, and get the "drive" that'll take you to the top of
                        the ladder.</ab>
                    <ab>I've Got NO USE for Apparatus</ab>
                    <ab>I haven't any use for tricky weights or pulleys and machines that may strain your heart and other vital or-gans. There's
                        nothing unnatural or artificial about this method of mine. And I don't dose you or doctor you. Dynamic-Tension is all I need.
