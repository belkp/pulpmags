The rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son is that our imagination is fired to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nth degree, and we thus obtain a reat-satisfaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the time spent in reading the story, improbable</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it often appears at first. I should like to point out</seg><seg type="columnLine">here how important this class of literature is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress and to the race in general.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The human mind is a tremendously complex ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine, which often works in a very strange manner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A man sets out to invent a certain house appliance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and while engaged in his experimental work, gets a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain stimulus that takes him in an entirely differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent direction, so that the first thought of the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">appliance may end in the invention of a factory</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor-saving device, or perhaps something even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">important.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Alexander Graham Bell was a young man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he occupied himself by devising means of enabling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deaf to hear. This led him into electrical re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">search work, and the apparatus, far from becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">a device by which the deaf can hear, became the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent telephone. To be sure, loud-speaking telephones</seg><seg type="columnLine">are made today for the use of the deaf, but this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a by-product and not at all the actual and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">important use of the instrument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hundreds and thousands of similar instances</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be cited. An author, in one of his fantastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientifiction stories, may start some one thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the suggested lines which the author had in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, whereas the inventor in the end will finish up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with something totally different, and perhaps much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more important. But the fact remains that the au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thor provided the stimulus in the first place, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a most important function to perform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other hand, many devices predicted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientifiction authors have literally come true for</seg><seg type="columnLine">many generations. There is an old popular saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">that what man imagines, man can accomplish. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">proverb of course, should be taken with a grain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">salt, because not everything that man imagines is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">possible. For instance, I can imagine that I blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the sun, or grasp the moon in my hand, or cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off my head without dying. Naturally such things</seg><seg type="columnLine">are impossible. On the other hand, many of the so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called wild ideas which we read in our scientifiction</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories may prove to be not quite so wild if they give</seg><seg type="columnLine">an actual stimulus to some inventor or inventor-to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">be who reads the story. And as long as there is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stimulus of any sort, we have no reason to complain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because we never realize where progress in any di-*</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection may lead us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is the well-known story of the inventor who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had patented a mouse-trap, and finally sold the pat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent to a manufacturer, who found that an excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">burglar alarm could be made from the mouse-trap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with but a few changes. Another case of an original</seg><seg type="columnLine">stimulus which, perhaps, went wrong, but finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">became righted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We should not, therefore, become too impatient if</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally we encounter a seemingly impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">prediction or improbable plot. It is beyond our pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er to foresee what reaction this may produce in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one, and what tremendous consequences it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have in the future. And, strange to relate, the pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent offices of most countries follow scientifiction</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories pretty closely, because in many of these the</seg><seg type="columnLine">germ of an invention is hidden. It is not necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">to actually build a model to be an inventor; often it</seg><seg type="columnLine">becomes necessary, for court proceedings and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">patent reasons, to find out who really was the orig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inal inventor of a certain device; if the inventor is</seg><seg type="columnLine">an author who brought out the device, even in a fic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion story, this would, in the long run, entitle him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ownership of the patent, always providing that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">device is carefully described, as to its functions, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose and so forth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For instance, in the United States, the inventor</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have two years from the publication of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story to apply for a patent. Thus it will be seen that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scientifiction story should not be taken too lightly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and should not be classed just as literature. Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it. It actually helps in the progress of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, if ever so little, and the fact remains that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">contributes something to progress that probably no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other kind of literature does.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Hugo Gemsback speaks every Monday at 9 P.

Lyman</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEFORE giving this really marvelous tale to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world, I feel that it is important to offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few lines of explanation, as well as a brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">sketch or synopsis of the events that led to my dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery of the manuscript relating the incredible ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventures of this writer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a fiaturalist specializing in ornithology, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">long been attracted to the regions of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">known Antarctic as a rich field for my studies. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">largely, perhaps, my interest in Antarctic ornith-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ology was due to the fact that I resided in New Bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford, a town famous in former years for the number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its whaling vessels, many of which sailed an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nually for the southern oceans in search of sea-ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant oil. From the officers of theae vessels I</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained many specimens of birds' skins and eggs</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought back by the obliging whalemen. Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimens were, however, more or less unsatisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory for scientific study, and I at last made up my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind to visit the Antarctic in person in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">observe and study that avifauna in its own habitat.,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It thus happened that I secured passage upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whaleship bound for the South Atlantic and South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian oceans, and, after an uneventful voyage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">several months, I found myself gazing from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark's deck at the frowning mountain peaks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kerguelen, or as it is also called, Desolation Island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here, in company with some ten of the bark's</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew, I was landed, and, having been amply sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied with provisions, tools and implements of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whalemen's trade, we saw the vessel sail away for</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Georgia, there to land other parties, which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like our own, would remain upon the barren bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">land until the bark's return the following year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I need not enter into a description of the wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful fauna and flora of the island, nor need I dilate</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the rare and interesting specimens which re-j</seg><seg type="columnLine">warded my daily tramps over the bare basaltic hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">or through the thick scrub and rank grass of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valleys, although to me those days were filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascination and all the naturalist's enthusiasm at</seg><seg type="columnLine">treading new fields of study.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suffice it to state that on one misty morning, hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing penetrated far into the interior of the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">in search of a new rookery of albatross, I was(</seg><seg type="columnLine">attracted by the strange behavior of one of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">great birds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He appeared unable to rise from the ground, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he repeatedly spread his immense wings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flapped upward for a few inches. But each time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fell back and struggled awkwardly about upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My nearer approach disclosed the fact that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird's legs was entangled in some object among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks, and, walking to within a few yards of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">albatross, I was surprised to find that a cord or line</seg><seg type="columnLine">was attached to the bird's leg, while the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremity of the cord was fastened to an object</seg><seg type="columnLine">that glittered curiously in the light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Consumed with curiosity, for I knew that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings had recently visited the spot, I cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously approached the albatross, and, throwing my</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat over its head, I stooped and endeavored to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">engage the line from the bird's leg. I found how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, that the cord, which was of a most unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic lustre, was spliced or woven about the leg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I therefore drew my sailor's sheath knife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove to cut the line which was scarcely larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than twine. Imagine if you can my surprise when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the keen-edged blade slipped uselessly along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord as though the knife had been of wood and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of steel!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Judging that the affair was some form of wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope, I then placed it across a small rock and ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered it with another stone, but without avail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bending it rapidly back and forth was equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">futile, and I therefore turned my attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">object to which the cord was attached, and which</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be a thin glass cylinder some two</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches in diameter and approximately six inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">in length. Through the crystal I could discern a</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll of some material resembling paper, and, feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that this was a message of some sort, I struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottle-like receptacle a smart blow with a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rock. I remember that, even as I did so, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentally wondering how such a fragile receptacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">had escaped annihilation during the rough usage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which it must have been subjected by its winged</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrier, but even this vague thought did not prepare</seg><seg type="columnLine">me for the result of my blow. Indeed, I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">adequately transcribe my utter amazement as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone rebounded from the glass container without</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving so much as a scratch or a crack upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was in fact, absolutely dumfounded. Eagerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stooped, and eXaminined the strange object more</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely and minutely. I discovered a small catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">or button near one end of the cylinder, and as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed upon this, the cord was suddenly released.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the cylinder now in my possession I gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">no further heed to the albatross, which immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew off, a most regrettable incident as he carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him the remarkable ligature which, had I</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured it, would have proved of inestimable scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific value. But my attention was focussed com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely upon the container which I found was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markably light, about the weight of aluminum, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged. But, despite its apparently fragile char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acter I could not succeed in either breaking or dent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the remarkable material, try as I might.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My curiosity was now at fever heat, for I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a certainty that no such material was known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized man, and that any message or communica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion enclosed within it must be of the utmost im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance and interest. In order to examine it more</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely I opened my pocket lens and commenced most</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully and painstakingly to go over the smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the astonishing receptacle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In so doing I advertently brought a point of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a focus upon the cylinder.

In a few brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments I had melted a space completely encircling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder, and, from the aperture thus made I</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew forth the roll of manuscript--for such the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents proved to be, and, spreading the pages com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced to read the incredible story written thereon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Certain passages, names and references assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that the story was no fiction nor the work of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disordered mind, for many of the incidents men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned as well as names referred to, were familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">582</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to me.

I could see nothing but the endless winter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter loneliness before me, with ultimate death</seg><seg type="columnLine">through accident or madness, unless by some remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance a sail hove in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In my calmer moments I held to this slender hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to conjure up all the tales I had heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">castaways living for years alone and yet being</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescued in the end. I had little fear of meeting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an accident as long as I kept my mind, and I real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized that my greatest danger lay in going mad as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Olaf had done. To avoid this as much as possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to prevent my thoughts from dwelling on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">plight, I commenced taking long trips across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills in search of game, carrying a supply of am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munition and a haversack filled with biscuit or</seg><seg type="columnLine">dried meat. On one of these tramps I had wandered</seg><seg type="columnLine">several miles from the hut and had reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">summit of a good sized hill, from which I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide view of the sea. Far down the shore I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">some object about which great flocks of sea fowl</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gathering, and thinking it a stranded whale or</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea elephant, I turned my steps towards the spot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I rounded a point of rocks and came within plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the object, I almost dropped in my tracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">from sheer amazement.

Stretched upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thwarts and bottom were the bodies of six men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces torn and mutilated by the sea birds. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">even in their ghastly state I knew them for Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Rankin and my former shipmates of the En-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deavor. I reeled away, for the sight was sickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stunning, and seized with insane and unreas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oning fright, I dropped my gun and dashed off</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND THE POLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">585</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">across the rocks and hills, striving with might and</seg><seg type="columnLine">main to get as far from the gruesome boat as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last I dropped from sheer exhaustion among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks, but even then the shock was so great</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I hid my face and screamed and raved like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">madman until consciousness left me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long I remained in that condition I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, for when at last I awoke to a knowledge of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">surroundings, I found myself wandering about amid</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick and thorny scrub on a steep hillside I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seen before. I was ravenously hungry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust my hand into my haversack in search of</seg><seg type="columnLine">food, only to find it empty save for a few crumbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ship's bread. Seating myself on a nearby rock I</seg><seg type="columnLine">munched these eagerly and tried to collect my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts and reason. I soon came to the conclusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had been delirious for a long time, and dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my period of temporary madness, had wandered</seg><seg type="columnLine">far, for my haversack had been full when I first</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighted the boat and was now empty, and I reasoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I must have devoured my food during my un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious wanderings. My watch had stopped, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">this mattered little, as for months I had been able</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely to guess at the time. A search of my pock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ets failed to reveal my compass but I felt this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no great loss at the time, for I had no doubt that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by climbing a neighboring hill, I could make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea and so find my way back to the hut, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I confess that the mere thought of again</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching the ghastly remains of my shipmates</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled me with most awful dread and caused me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shudder violently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My tongue and throat were parched and dry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hard crumbs of biscuit added to my thirst, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once commenced to push my way up the hillside</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the shrubbery. As I reached the top and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about, no gleaming bit of sea greeted my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. On every side stretched rolling, round-topped</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills, each and all clothed in dull, brownish-gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrub, save just behind me, where the more distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">landscape was hidden from view by a higher range</seg><seg type="columnLine">of small mountains. Although my thirst was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbearable yet I knew that my one hope of finding</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way was to ascend the higher hill, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinking heart and lagging footsteps, I started for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Slowly and painfully I climbed their rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rocky slopes, stopping often to rest and regain</seg><seg type="columnLine">my failing breath, but at last I stood upon their</seg><seg type="columnLine">crest and gazed anxiously about the horizon. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment my head swam and a mist floated before</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes. Then my vision cleared and I saw before</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a long, sloping hillside covered with scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrubs, while below and stretching far towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon, was a green and pleasant valley on whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther edge rose high and rugged mountains misty</seg><seg type="columnLine">■with distance. But though no water gladdened my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, yet near at hand I saw a number of great birds</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling penguins, and towards these I rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">made my way. They were stupid and fearless and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a moment I had killed the first one I reached and</seg><seg type="columnLine">greedily drank its rick warm blood. This refreshed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me greatly, but feeling still hungry, I gathered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantity of eggs, which I ate raw, and feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowsy made my way to a sheltered nook among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks and fell into a deep and dreamless sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I awoke feeling strong but half famished, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once fell to on the helpless birds and their eggs. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">now considered my next step and as there evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing to be gained by retracing my way I</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to travel towards the valley where I judged</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps water might be found, for although the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood and raw eggs had somewhat quenched my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirst, yet the desire for water was overpowering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I did not know if I would find more birds farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, I laid in a good supply of flesh and eggs, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I noticed that my shoes were almost worn out, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped birds' skins about my feet, binding them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in place with strips of the skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I now noticed that these birds were not penguins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I had at first thought, nor in fact anything like</seg><seg type="columnLine">any birds I had even before seen. I judged there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore that I was far from the coast, but I was wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">without means of ascertaining the dix-ection of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea or my position, for I had seen nothing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun since finding the boat, although the days were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright enough. As I thought on this its strange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness came to me and I also marveled that I was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffering from the cold. The more I thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these matters the more I wondered, for now that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to think of it, the weather was quite warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I had seen no snow or ice, even among the crev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ices of the rocks. But I had other things to occupy</seg><seg type="columnLine">my attention, for my thirst for water and my desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape from my surroundings filled my head to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exclusion of all less pressing matters, as for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour after hour I tramped on across the valley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the hilltop it had appeared clothed in soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass, but when I reached it I found to my sorrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the vegetation was thorny, pointed-leaf shrubs</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose tangled branches formed an almost impene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trable jungle which made my progress painful and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow beyond belief. I soon lost all sense of time or</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, but toiled on towards the distant mount-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains, eating the birds' flesh and eggs when hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at last sinking down to sleep when my tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">and torn flesh refused to carry me farther on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Only by looking at the hills behind me could</seg><seg type="columnLine">I see that I had made any progress towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains, which seemed as distant as ever. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually the hills grew dim in the distance, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, the mountains became more distinct and</seg><seg type="columnLine">great seams and patches of vegetation appeared up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their slopes. It was well for me that I had laid in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a supply of meat and eggs, for I saw no sign of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the dreary plain, except one great beast that ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared like a gigantic lizard or iguana. In fact, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous was the creature, that I feared my brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone adrift again and that it was but a vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">of delirium. The beast appeared more afraid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me than I of him, however, and so little interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">did I have in anything save the desire for water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach the farther side of the valley that I doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I would have turned aside or would have fled even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the devil himself had confronted me. Cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain it is that the presence of this huge creature--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would say he was forty feet in length--did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent me from dropping off to sleep as usual that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last my provisions became perilously low and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when finally I reached the bases of the mountains I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reduced to two eggs, while my makeshift boots</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone entirely and my garments were merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few dirty rags and shreds. To climb those rugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains seemed utterly beyond my power, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed a sort of cut or ravine a half mile or so dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">586</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tant, and thinking this might be a pass through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains, I dragged myself toward it. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep fissure and extended far up the mountain side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and while it made the climb a bit easier I soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that the task was far greater than I had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected, and only by the utmost efforts could I force</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way upward. But some unknown force or in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinct seemed to drag me on, and even when my last</seg><seg type="columnLine">egg had been devoured I did not despair, but strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled and found my way, foot by foot, over the rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and boulders and through patches of low scrub, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til almost fainting from hunger and thirst, I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another colony of the strange birds. On these I</seg><seg type="columnLine">feasted until satisfied, and while resting and tying</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the bird-skins on my bruised and swollen</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, I found time to give some thought to my sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had often heard of the theory of a vast Antarc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic continent, and although I of course knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shackleton had found the South Pole, still I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now convinced that I had passed the pole and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this unknown land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the fact that the weather was warm puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">me immensely, while quite beyond my understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was the fact that I had seen no glimpse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun on my long tramp across the plain. No theory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however wild and impossible, would account ~Yor</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, for it was not dark but as bright as any Ant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arctic day, and neither could I understand how, es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecially without the sun, I could feel comfortably</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm. At last, giving up the puzzle in despair, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered up my load of birds and eggs and once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more started on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And here it may be well to explain why I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to think upon such matters, which are usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond, the mind of a sailor, and how, as will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen later, I happened to have a knowledge of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters, such as science, mechanics and similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">things of which the sailor or whaleman, as a rule,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows nothing. For several years I had been an of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficer on one of the ships of the United States Fish</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commission, and from the scientists engaged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep sea research I had learned a great deal about</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural history which interested me always, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">learning for the first time that specimens of animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, minerals and plants had a cash value, I secured</seg><seg type="columnLine">a commission from one of the museums to collect</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimens on my whaling voyages to distant parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world. This led me to study works on science,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through long Arctic nights, I filled my brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all manner of knowledge relating to geology,/</seg><seg type="columnLine">zoology, botany and other similar matters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, I had always been fond of mechanics, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the whaling industry waned ahd the demand for</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors decreased in the merchant service, I bent my</seg><seg type="columnLine">energies to acquiring a knowledge of machinery</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that I might secure a berth on some steam or</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor-propelled craft. In doing this I became ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed in the matter and found vast interest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading all manner of books and magazines treating</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the latest inventions and discoveries in the me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanical world. Of course I had little practical</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of these things, but the theories were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed in my mind, and as it proved later, were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">great value to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to resume my narrative. Long and weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">as my tramp across the plain had been, tenfold</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse was the never ending upward climb towards</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the cloud-piercing summits of the mountains. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">days were measured only by my waking moments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the light never ceased, and my labor was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked by long periods of panting, heartbreaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">toil and periods of deep sleep, and while, to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of track of the hours, I had started my</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch, yet this gave me no real time, but merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">served to let my Enow how long I slept and how long</seg><seg type="columnLine">I toiled upwards. Five days of this labor had again</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn my makeshift footgear to pieces and had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced my provisions to my last egg, when I reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the summit of the mountains, and falling exhausted</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the bare and wind-swept rocks, looked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the farther side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At my first glance my heart gave a great throb</seg><seg type="columnLine">of joy and I thanked heaven that I had been led on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the summit. Spreading from the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains was a wide level plain covered with rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">and verdant green, while far away, gleaming like</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver in the bright light, stretched a vast expanse;</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forgetting my sore, torn feet and my utter ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haustion, I rose and dashed forward down the slope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stumbling over boulders, tripped by vines and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrubs, falling, sliding and scrambling, I reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom in a few hours and dashed into the lux-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uriant grass that rose higher than my head. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">my strength failed me, and falling upon the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt utterly unable to rise again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently I heard a slight rustling sound in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass near me, and glancing up, beheld a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal staring at me in wonder, but evidently with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the least fear. Thinking only to secure some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to eat I managed to stagger to my feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started towards the animal. I had no weapon ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept my knife, but the beast stood his ground until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was within a few feet when, by a sudden spring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I reached his side, and driving my knife into his(</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat, brought him down. In my famished state</seg><seg type="columnLine">his blood and raw, warm meat were as welcome as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the daintiest food, and having satisfied myself, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell asleep beside his partially devoured carcass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several hours later I awoke, feeling much strong-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er, and looked more closely at the beast whose fort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">unate appearance had saved my life. I found hinS</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a sort of huge rat or mouse--although I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first mistaken him for a small deer--and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach turned a bit at the thought that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually eaten his flesh. I now became conscious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar quality in the air that I had not noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. At first I was puzzled to account for it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but gradually I realized that the light had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensely blue instead of white or yellow. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like looking through a blue-tinted glass, and for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time I noticed that my hands and knife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the face of my watch, appeared bluish and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange. My longing for water, however, was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">great to allow me to give mueh thought to the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turning from the dead animal--for hungry a3</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was I could not force myself to eat more of him--i</seg><seg type="columnLine">started on in the direction of the water I had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the mountain top. The grass grew close and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very dry and gave off a dusty, choking material</seg><seg type="columnLine">or pollen which filled my eyes, nose and mouth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each moment increased my thirst and dried and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blistered my aching, parched throat; But gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grass became thinner and now and then I caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpses of small creatures ahd birds that fled be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND THE POLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">587</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fore me, while the ground under my feet became</seg><seg type="columnLine">less dry and parched, until presently, the damp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet smell of water reached me. A moment later</seg><seg type="columnLine">I burst through the last of the grass and saw be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore me a sandy beach lapped by tiny waves whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound was the most welcome thing I had ever heard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rushing across the beach, I threw myself face</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the water's edge with a sickening fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the water might be salt. But my first taste</seg><seg type="columnLine">reassured me, and burying my face and hands in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waves, I drank until I felt sick and nauseated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when, crawling up the beach on all fours, I drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself into the shelter of the grass and lost con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER 3.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SLOWLY I opened my eyes and as I did so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed aloud with terror and wonder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Standing over me was a fearsome, terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature. That he was not a man I knew at my first</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance, and yet, there was something that resembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man about him, but so terribly monstrous, weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">and incredible, so utterly inhuman, that I felt sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must be dreaming or out of my senses. He or it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fully eight feet in height, standing on two legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a man, and seemingly clad from head to foot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some soft, downy material that glistened with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand colors, like the throat of a humming bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the tints on a soap bubble. Above the shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a large, elongated, pointed head with a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and a long, pointed snout. From the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head projected long stalks or horns and on the tip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each of these was an unwinking, gleaming eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the eyes of a crab. In place of eyebrows two</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, slender, jointed, fleshy tentacles drooped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the creature's shoulders, while the ears were</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, soft and pendulous like those of a hound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no hair upon the head, but instead, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of brilliant, shining scales or plates, lap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping one over the other from the forehead to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nape of the neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No wonder I was horrified and startled at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparition and as I gazed upon the thing and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it possessed three pairs of long, many-jointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, I shrieked again at the monstrosity of it. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">my cry and my terrified actions, the creature raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand in a reassuring gesture and I was further</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrified to see that in place of fingers the arm end-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed in a mass of delicate various-shaped appendages</seg><seg type="columnLine">of several sizes, that reminded me of the soft legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the belly of a crawfish or shrimp. I shrank away</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as possible, but the being seemed to smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stalked eyes drew back into his head and he ut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered some strange sounds in a low, soft tone which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I judge were words of greeting or reassurance, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though to my ears they meant nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finding I did not respond--for I was still too</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazed and frightened to utter a sound--the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped and extended a small object towards me. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembled a ship's biscuit in form and size and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hesitated to take it the creature pointed to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own mouth and nodded, evidently meaning I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to eat it. I had no difficulty in grasping this mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and famished as I was, rather hesitatingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the object and greedily devoured it. In taste</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was slightly sweet with a rather pleasant arom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atic flavor and I at once signed my desire for more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My weird friend, for I now knew that despite his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful appearance the creature was well disposed'</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards me, handed me two more of the biscuits</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as he did so I had a chance to look more closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his hands. They were truly remarkable. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dozen or more finger-like digits was of a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinct form and size. Some were large, strong and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blunt; others slender and pointed; others with pin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cer-like tips, while still others were divided at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremities into several filaments almost as fine as</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairs. Marvelous and repulsive as they seemed, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not help realizing even then what wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful work such hands might accomplish if they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled by intelligence and muscles as perfect as</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's, and yet my wildest ideas of such things fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">far short of the reality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seating himself, or I might say, sprawling him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, beside me, the thing watched me munch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">biscuit and I in turn gazed at him with the utmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity, as I had now partially overcome my dread.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I now saw that what I had mistaken for clothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in reality a growth upon the skin, a material</seg><seg type="columnLine">something like wool and yet something like feathers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The feet, too, I found were as strange as the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the body or the hands, for in place of toes, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore round-tipped digits covered with saucer-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">suckers like those upon the tentacles of an octopus</seg><seg type="columnLine">or squid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Undoubted I was as great a marvel to him as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to me, for I could see that his surprise at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance was tremendous. His long flexible feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers rose and fell about me--though not touching</seg><seg type="columnLine">me for which I was thankful--his eyes turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved up and down as he looked me over from head</seg><seg type="columnLine">to foot, and presently, realizing I no longer feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he extended one hand and very gently passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over my clothing. I shuddered at the first touch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as one of the appendages or fingers touched my</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh and I found it soft and warm and not cold or</seg><seg type="columnLine">clammy as I had expected, my revulsion became</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. Still the sensation of being handled or touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the horribly formed thing was creepy and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use all my will to avoid drawing back. Evident-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly he was greatly surprised at the result of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">examination and gazed at me more intently than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, meanwhile uttering low, strange words or</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds that reminded me of the purring of a cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a little of the rasping, metallic sound of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cricket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, seeing I had eaten the last of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">biscuits, the creature rose to his two hind feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded two other pairs of limbs under his body, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beckoning with the fourth pair, or as I might call</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, his arms, made me understand that I was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow him. Filled with curiosity to know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonders lay before me, and feeling sure the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture was friendly and peaceable, I also rose and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my amazement found that all my health and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength had returned in a most miraculous man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. I was as refreshed, light hearted and free</seg><seg type="columnLine">from aches, soreness or pain as ever in my life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I walked with springy, buoyant steps after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird being my mind was filled with wonder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surely, I thought, the three small biscuits could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have stayed my ravenous appetite and given</seg><seg type="columnLine">me such strength, and yet there was no other way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to account for it. But whatever the reason, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubles were over for the present. I had water in</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty before me, the creature leading the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">588</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">across the beach could provide food, and whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">the future might hold or wherever I might be, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not die of thirst or starvation, while the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible giant was friendly and apparently wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had no doubt that he was leading me to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">house or settlement, and I was filled with curiosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see what manner of creatures dwelt in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange land. That they would be most interesting I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt sure, for I knew that, hitherto, the Antarctic</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been thought uninhabited by man, and I wond-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered if they would resemble Eskimos, Indians or</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Sea Islanders. That they should have dom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esticated such strangely weird creatures as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">being who was guiding me, proved not only that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were intelligent, but that I might expect other</seg><seg type="columnLine">and perhaps even greater surprises, while the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this monstrosity was so kindly and well dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed assured me that his masters would treat me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with consideration. It was all very dream-like, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it not been for my ragged garments, my thorn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn and bruised flesh and my sore feet I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have felt sure that it was all a figment of my over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought brain, for it was almost too incredible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be true. I had set out from the desolate, forbidding</seg><seg type="columnLine">shores of the Antarctic within a few degrees of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Pole, and here I was in a land as mild and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant as New England in June; the sea--or what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I took to be the sea--was fresh pure water; the bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant sunshine, which should not have existed at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this spot, was pale blue instead of white; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me strode a creature such as no mortal man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever seen save in some nightmare or the deliri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">um of fever or drink; while to me, at the time, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most incredible thing of all was the fact that after</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating three small, dry biscuits I had regained all</seg><seg type="columnLine">my strength and felt as fresh--with the exception</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my blistered feet--as ever in my life.	__</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had walked along the beach for some time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was beginning to wonder how much farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">we must travel, when we rounded a bend and I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar object resting on the sand a few yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of us. It was about fifty feet in length, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet in diameter, cylindrical and with pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends, resembling in a way a gigantic cigar. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish light it shone with the brilliant lustre of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, but with a peculiar purplish sheen that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlike any metal I had ever seen. As we approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">this object, I halted in my tracks with gaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and staring, incredulous eyes. A door had</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened in the affair, and from the aperture, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the weirdly horrible looking creatures had</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. In every detail they were exactly like my</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide, except that one was mueh smaller and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with a pale, pinkish coat of down or feath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, or whatever the material might be called. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly, I was aware of a peculiar, vibrating, hum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming sound and noticed that my companion's feelers</seg><seg type="columnLine">or antennae had risen erect above his head and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving slowly, gracefully back and forth, as were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feelers of the two other creatures; but no word</seg><seg type="columnLine">or sound that could be thought speech issued from</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of the three.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later we were beside the great, cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drical object and the two beings who had been with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it were gazing at me with the greatest wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and interest. Their stalked eyes were moving this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Way and that, studying me from head to foot; their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">feelers were vibrating with excitement; their lop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears were waving like the ears of an elephant, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently, with queer, low sounds from their lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stretched out their jointed limbs and rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitatingly and cautiously touched my garments</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their many digited hands or feet, whichever</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might be called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was, I admit, most uneasy and not a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened and had a peculiar sense of repulsion as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creatures approached close to me and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacles played about my face and their soft finger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like extremities caressed my tattered clothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I knew that for the present at least I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">real cause for alarm, for they seemed really gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures. But if my readers--provided this</seg><seg type="columnLine">manuscript ever finds a reader--can imagine stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing beside three immense crayfish larger than any</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant of a dime museum, they can perhaps, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure, realize the sensations that went over me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even so I found myself wondering if the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder before me was the dwelling of these weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, if it was a sort of shell-like house, and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three were the only denizens of this unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, or if there were more of their kind. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly dismissed the thought. They were merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely developed, remarkably intelligent beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was inconceivable that they should have con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed the metallic affair from which they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged. In fact, the presence of this convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that there were human beings not far distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the creatures beside me were merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarding the metallic object and awaiting their</seg><seg type="columnLine">master's return. Moreover, the fact that this huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, cigar-like thing was there proved beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt that the men who dwelt in the land were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive savages, but intelligent and civilized, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though what the purpose of the thing was was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite beyond me. Possibly, I thought, it was some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of boat--for it looked much like one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floats to a metal life raft--perhaps a submarine;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there were no signs of rudders, fins, propellers</seg><seg type="columnLine">or other external fittings on its smooth surface, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside from the door or port from which the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures had emerged, no opening or aperture in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal as far as I could see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, I had little time for thought on such mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters. Their first curiosity satisfied, my guide ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured for me to follow, and entered the big cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the other two following in my footsteps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scarcely knowing what to expect, I passed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door and glanced about. I was in a long room</seg><seg type="columnLine">or hallway illuminated by a strange luminous glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an exclamation of the utmost amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped my lips as I discovered that the walls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder were as transparent as glass. Stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing there, I could see the beach, the stretch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, the green fringe of grass and bushes, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly as though I were in the open air and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from without, the interior of the contrivance had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been utterly invisible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was astounding enough, but before I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully appreciate the wonder of it, there were more</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildering matters to fill my brain. The interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">held no machinery, the only fittings in sight being</seg><seg type="columnLine">couch-like benches, rugs or carpets and an affair at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one end which at first glance I took to be a buffet or</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar, for it bore a number of shining metallic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass-like utensils. Above and behind it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND THE POLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'589</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">panel or rectangle covered with strange dials and</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments, and as we entered and the door closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us with a slight metallic clink, the creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had first found me approached this buffet-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangement. Reaching out his arms, he moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain things upon the panel, with his other limbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">he touched the utensils on the piece of furniture</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him. Instantly, there was a strange musical</seg><seg type="columnLine">humming which rose swiftly to a whirring sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the muffled noise of machinery and glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the transparent sides of the cylinder, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dumbfounded to see the beach and the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly dropping from beneath us. For a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not understand and then, with a shock at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discovery, I realized that we were mounting up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward with incredible speed. Within the space of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few seconds we were several hundred feet above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach and the next instant my bewildered senses</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped the fact that we were hurtling through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air like a bullet from a rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Almost before I knew it the beach and the grassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain beyond it were dim in the distance, the faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlined waves upon the water seemed to rush back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and yet there was not the least movement ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preciable within the transparent cylinder, and al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I could see the entire interior from where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, there was no sign of machinery, no hint of</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines, of whirring wheels or shafts. It was ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely impossible and incredible. Within a cigar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped cylinder, which even if made of aluminum</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have weighed tons, I was being hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">through space by invisible means controlled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">indescribably strange creatures beside me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I peered ahead, for I knew that we must be bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some definite goal, and saw land rising rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into view upon the horizon. Each second it became</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearer, a low shore backed by hills deliciously green</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bathed in the blue light that flooded everything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as the land grew rapidly more distinct, bright,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining dots appeared among the greenery and pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sently, above the water's edge, an immense town or</seg><seg type="columnLine">city lay spread. At the speed at which we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling we would be there within fifteen minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as I glanced to right and left, I saw a score of</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft similar to the one I was in, all rushing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air like monstrous, gleaming cannon shells.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like streaks of light they crossed our path above or</seg><seg type="columnLine">below us; to right and left they passed. Some were</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny things scarcely ten feet in length; others</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic affairs several hundred feet in length, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">all moving noiselessly, with incredible speed, driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some unseen, incomprehensible, terrific power.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Below us, now, the water was dotted with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange vessels, their shimmering hulls, if such I</seg><seg type="columnLine">may call them, resting on the surface or skittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">along slowly and leaving foamy wakes across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little waves. Then we were dropping, descending</seg><seg type="columnLine">as lightly as a bit of thistle down, and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">under my feet I saw the outlying buildings of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. So rapidly did we drop that at the time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no chance to note the form or details of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings, except to see that they were of strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">design and color, but even in our swift fall, in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">space of a few seconds, I saw that the inhabitants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beings who thronged the .streets, were no hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans, but one and all the same grotesque, mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strous creatures as those beside me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER 4,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHOCKED as I was at this discovery I saw that:</seg><seg type="columnLine">our arrival had been noticed, and that froirj</seg><seg type="columnLine">every side, hurrying down the streets, swarm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out of buildings, the creatures were rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a close packed mass towards a clear, open space</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a broad level field which I judged was our</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing place. The next moment our strange air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was at rest, and filled with unreasoning dread,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling at thought of facing; that horde of mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters, I followed my guides or captors, which ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were, through the door and stepped upon tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm earth once more. All about the borders of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field, which I now saw was covered with cradle*</seg><seg type="columnLine">like structures like the one in which our craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested, the stalk-eyed, misshapen beings had gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered, a maze of swaying, undulating antennae, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall, pointed, scale-covered heads and irridescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies; but not one attempted to approach or to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass within the boundaries of the landing place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly had I noticed this, and wondered at it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when from one side a group of the monsters stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. At first glance they seemed no different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others, but as they drew close I saw that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of a totally different color, being a peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet-blue, and that two pairs of their limbs or</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms ended in enormous, vicious-looking claws or</seg><seg type="columnLine">nippers like those of a lobster. Even as I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">this they reached us and I shuddered as I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of how easily the creatures could crush and tear</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to bits with those fearful pincers with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">serrated teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But for the present the claws were at rest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed and their owners made no hostile movement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forming on either side of my guides and myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they marched beside us, and before them the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell back, leaving an open lane through which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before us were buildings, and for the first time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I obtained a clear view of the structures and gaped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as astonished at their appearance as I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been at the monstrous forms of their owners. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">high in air they had seemed low, massive structures</seg><seg type="columnLine">with nothing particularly remarkable about them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now, close at hand I saw that they were unlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything I had ever seen, although in a vague way</seg><seg type="columnLine">they reminded me of gigantic igloos. Windowless</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rose like domes of dull-gray above the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only apertures in their walls, dark, yawning'</seg><seg type="columnLine">arched doorways towards one of which my guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">were marching. As we entered the portal my pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing glance showed me that the affairs were not of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud or clay as I had thought at first, but were</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed of small stones and pebbles cemented</seg><seg type="columnLine">together with some hard tenacious material giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the effect of being hewn from coarse pudding</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone, or as I believe geologists call it, conglomerate</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next instant we were within the entrance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were descending a steep incline. So sharp was thei</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope that the skin coverings on my feet slipped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet shot out from under me and with a startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry I went sliding and rolling through the semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness like a bale of cargo down a chute. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">far I might have gone or where I might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought up I cannot say, for with incredible agility*</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of the monsters overtook me and with theiij</seg><seg type="columnLine">590</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•weird limbs--which made me shudder as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched me--brought me to a halt and helped me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite the confusion and my predicament I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that the creatures, when in a hurry, ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">along on all fours, or rather I might say on all</seg><seg type="columnLine">eights, and I realized that the sucker-like disks on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feet enabled them to navigate the steep pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage without the least danger of slipping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No doubt my mishap seemed very amusing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange beings, but no sounds of merriment</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from them and to this moment I have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard anything that remotely resembled a laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">or chuckle issue from the mouths of the creatures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole affair, yes, everything that had occur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">red since I had seen the castaway boat with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpses of my dead shipmates, was so dreamlike, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmarish that, try as I might, I could not con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vince myself that I was awake and that the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">events were actually taking place and that the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings,--intelligent, reasoning, possessing powers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mechanical devices beyond anything dreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of by man, and yet mere beasts or creatures of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower order--really existed and were not the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of a disordered or wandering mind. But my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall was very real and as the creatures aided me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise and I ruefully rubbed my bruised and barked</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs I knew that the tumble at least was no delir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ium. Indeed, I think that my mishap was the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">convincing thing that had occurred. It is really</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange how little, unimportant, every day matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">are often of so much greater importance in our lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">than great events, and all that I had undergone had</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to impress me as much, or to bring so vividly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my mind, the marvelous situation in which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found myself as that tumble on the steep incline</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading through the darkness to the interior of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some subterranean chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the time, however, I had little opportunity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give much thought to such matters. Before me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull light shone, and a moment later, we emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the passage and entered a huge, round cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber. Although, at my first sight of the place, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not take in the details, it may be as well to</seg><seg type="columnLine">describe it at this point of my narrative. The floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was smooth, white and seemed made of some lumin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous material; the walls glowed with dull light, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high, domed ceiling appeared as if of glass with</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant bluish light streaming through it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About the walls was a low bench or shelf-like ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangement covered with what appeared to be cush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions; scattered about were curiously shaped chairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">or stools, and in the centre, was a sort of raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">dais or platform on which were several more seats</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a desk-like arrangement covered with dials and</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments, much like the affair I had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem in the airship and by means of which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures handled the craft. Upon the bench about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls, and seated on the other stools, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">several dozen of the beings to whom I was now be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming accustomed. In a general way they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">precisely like my guards and the creature I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">first met upon the distant beach, but in details</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were different. In fact, no two were exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">alike, although it was not until long afterward that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I learned to distinguish the various differences,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of which were very minute. They were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all colors, from white to nearly black, although all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had the same peculiar metallic sheen I had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted, and all likewise possessed eight limbs, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-stalked eyes and the antennae. Already I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been impressed with the striking resemblance</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creatures bore to giant crawfish, but now, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gazed about the huge chamber, I had the feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that I was surrounded by huge crustaceans</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed of intelligent, reasoning brains. Pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly I cannot convey to my readers--if by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">will of God this narrative ever reaches human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings---the weirdly impossible, dreamlike and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a way, horrible sensations that swept over</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as I stared at the scaly heads, the slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving stalked eyes, the waving, undulating</seg><seg type="columnLine">antennae and the eight jointed limbs of these be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings and realized that here in this strange land</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the South Pole evolution had proceeded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very amazing and very different manner to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had taken place in the world of men. Years</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I had read, among my other books, a work</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Darwin on evolution and the survival of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fittest. Although I had never fully accepted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea that mankind had descended or ascended from</seg><seg type="columnLine">some monkey-like ancestor, still I could understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">how it might be possible, and I had been convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">that man, as well as other members of the animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">kingdom, had developed from other more primitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms. And now, as I stood within the illuminated</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber, it suddenly dawned upon my mind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creatures among whom my lot had been cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually proved Darwin's theory. Here before me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all about me were beings no whit less intelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">than human beings; creatures who had conquered</seg><seg type="columnLine">space and time with incredible aircraft; beings who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could converse without words and who, I later found,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were far in advance of man, and yet who bore not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remotest resemblance to humans. To put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter in a few words; just as men resemble highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed and advanced apes, so these beings re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembled crustaceans. If the human race had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolved from some ape-like creature, then beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow of a doubt, these creatures had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolved from some lobster-like ancestor. The dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery came to me as a shock. So accustomed are</seg><seg type="columnLine">we to think that intelligent, reasoning, civilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings must be moulded in human form that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather dazed me to find that the mere form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">body and limbs had nothing to do with it; that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere chance that man's ancestors had been apes or</seg><seg type="columnLine">ape-like had led to the physical appearance of hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man beings, and that, had some other form of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the fittest to survive and had gone through</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages of evolution, our world might have been peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pled by insects, reptiles or any other creatures as</seg><seg type="columnLine">progressive, intelligent and highly civilized as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here before me was the proof of this. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution had proceeded from cold-blooded, spineless</seg><seg type="columnLine">crustaceans, and the result was these shrimp-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">giants, possessing powers beyond my own or those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mankind. Of course, at the time, the full signi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficance of the matter did not come to me, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">time passed and I learned how immeasurably be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond man these creatures had advanced I became</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and more convinced that the accident of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">origin of the human race had been an unfortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than a fortunate thing for the world and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, had we been evolved from ants, say, we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND THE POLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">591</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have been much farther along the road to highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">attainments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I am digressing. At the time I was really</seg><seg type="columnLine">more impressed by the curious discoveries I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">than by thoughts on evolution. One of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">things I noticed, and which oddly enough had quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped me hitherto, was the fact that the creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed tails. These were broad, flat affairs com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed of overlapping plates or scales and which</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually remained folded like fans. This no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the reason they had escaped my notice, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">being of the same color and texture as the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bodies, I had taken them for ornamental</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendant affairs, portions of the garments which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thought the things wore, for I had not yet dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that the feather-like covering of their bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a natural growth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, however, I saw that when seated the tails</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck stiffly out behind the creatures, or in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases were cui'led around to one side, and that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved to and fro, opening and shutting in a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinating manner. Some I noted also, were far</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger than others, and, later, I learned to disting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uish the males and females by the form and size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their tails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Of course all this which has taken so much time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to write down occupied but a few instants and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, having swept about the chamber, turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dais in the center and the creatures who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  These were taller, more slender and more brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">in color than the others. Their heads were higher,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broader and rounder; their antennse were longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their eyes, borne on long stalks like the others;</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to me to have a more intelligent expression,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if indeed, such hard, cold, unwinking orbs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of expression of any sort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By intuition I knew that they were leaders or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rulers and that I was being brought before them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and somehow this almost human proceedure of be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing led by armed guards before a tribunal sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by a curious crowd struck me as both</seg><seg type="columnLine">ludicrous and amazing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That I was in danger never occurred to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Possibly it was because I had been through so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was callous of danger, or perhaps it was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause man instinctively looks down upon inferior</seg><seg type="columnLine">races or creatures; but whatever the reason, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I was fully aware that I was at their mercy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt no fear but rather was filled with interest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity as to what would occur. Indeed, I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">precisely as I have felt when, in dreams, I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been dragged before a court to be tried for my life</seg><seg type="columnLine">on some ridiculous charge, and knowing I might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">condemned to death, yet I felt no dread of the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults, owing to a peculiar subconscious conviction</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I would escape harm and would awaken before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the actual execution took place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Also, I was filled with a curiosity as to how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing was to be conducted, for while there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt that the creatures could converse readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">among themselves, their words, or whatever means</seg><seg type="columnLine">they used, were inaudible to me, and when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered sounds, as they did at times, the almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic noises were uttely unintelligible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I had far underestimated the uncanny, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible powers of the creatures. Suddenly I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware, as one beoomes aware of some unseen person</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing at one in a crowd, that I was being question-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. I cannot describe the sensation, cannot make</seg><seg type="columnLine">it clear. There was no sound, nothing to tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my ears were receiving any message, and as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of fact they were not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet my brains, or some unknown sense, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiving a message, questions which, could they</seg><seg type="columnLine">be put into word, might have been been expressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as "Who are you ? Whence do you come? What is</seg><seg type="columnLine">your purpose?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was I dreaming, losing my senses, going mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my past hardships and my amazing adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures? And then, almost unconsciouly, I found my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self replying to the inaudible queries. I was trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain how I had been shipwrecked, how I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered across the mountains and had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this land, and that my only purpose was, if pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, to return to ray own countiy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as I thus responded to the uncanny question</seg><seg type="columnLine">entering my brain without audible sounds, I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the actions of the strange beings that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">replies had been understood. Their antennse waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trembled excitedly. They turned their stalked</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and gazed at one another and at myself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they even uttered the queer metallic sounds which</seg><seg type="columnLine">always denoted great excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had been astounding enough to discover that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creatures could make themselves understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some occult, uncanny power; but to find that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make my thoughts clear to them was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond reason. How had it been accomplished?</seg><seg type="columnLine">How was it possible for me, a totally different be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from another world, to understand these strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures? And what was still more astonishing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more inexplicable yet, how had I been able to trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fer my thoughts to their brains? Was it some</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird, undreamed-of method of mental telepathy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypnotism or what? Even if they possessed some</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, some unknown means of making me under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand them, I certainly had no such power. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet I was convinced that I had made myself clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, or at my rate had managed to reply in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some fashion to their queries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the next instant my belief was confirmed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once more, in my brain, questions were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">registered, questions as intelligible as though I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the words spoken in English. I was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked about "my world," questioned as to details</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ray journey, as to whether there were more be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings like myself and various other matters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost before I realized it, I was replying and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I could see by the manner of my strange hosts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my words were heard and understood. It is of no</seg><seg type="columnLine">use to describe at length the entire interview that</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed or to repeat it word for word. It is enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my purpose to state that my story was as un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">believable and as impossible to them as they and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their powers seemed to me. I had appeared from</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowhere, a strange, and to them misshapen being,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a creature unlike anything they had ever imagined,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I found myself trying to explain, floundering</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, trying to make clear matters which to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">were most everyday and ordinary things, but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were so far beyond their comprehension that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were utterly incapable of grasping them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was like trying to explain trigonometry or</seg><seg type="columnLine">navigation to a small child or to make clear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">principles and operation of some complicated ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">592	AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chine to a savage. And yet this comparison is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right one, for strange as it may seem, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures were quite capable of understanding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most intricate mechanical devices and scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters, although the fact that there were other</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent beings- in the world, or that for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter there was any world except their own coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try, was utterly beyond them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course I did not learn this and did not at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to converse with them on such matters at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this first interview. Our talk, for regardless of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that they did not speak I must call it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk, was confined to the most simple matters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as the weeks, months and years passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I remained, as I still remain, among them, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to tell them of human life and the world 1 had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known and of all manner of things which differed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their own strange ways and existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually, too, I became adept at conversing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them by their uncanny means, which, I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, was nothing supernatural, magical nor so</seg><seg type="columnLine">very mysterious after all.

Im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately he led me through dark passageways</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a smaller room and there left me for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning with a bowl-like vessel containing some</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid and a beautifully devised casket or box filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the biscuits such as he had given me upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I devoured three of these and was about to eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fourth when the creature, who had been watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me intently, called a halt and by the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange brain message method warned me that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be satisfied and that to partake of more might</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead to grave results. I confess I was greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to disregard his warning, for there seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more sustenance in the stuff than in a dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracker, but I remembered what a miraculous effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">those I had eaten on the beach had had, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luctantly replacing the wafer I drank a deep draught</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the liquid. It was as clear and colorless as water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for which I had taken it, but as it passed my lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">I almost dropped the bowl in surprise, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beverage was the most delightful and refreshing</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I had ever tasted. It was neither sweet nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">sour, but had a taste absolutely impossible to des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cribe. Indeed, there are many things in this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">land which I am at a loss to describe in such a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">that those who have not seen or experienced them</seg><seg type="columnLine">can understand my meaning. Colors existed which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were quite different from anything I had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen; there were sounds totally new to my ears and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tastes that no words can describe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scarcely had the beverage passed my lips when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt rejuvenated. No wine or liquor could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had such a remarkable effect. Not that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heady or exhilarating like liquor, for my head re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained perfectly clear, but I felt years younger. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed as strong and fresh as a youth of twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and felt ready for anything. Then a delightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowsiness came over me, and throwing myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the couch, I instantly dropped off to a dreamless</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was aroused by the being who had me in charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he entered the chamber bearing food and drink.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I munched the wafer-like biscuits, which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a different character from those I had eaten the</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous day, I tried my best to communicate with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Or rather, I might say, to carry on a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation, for he very evidently understood all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said. Moreover, as on the preceding day, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to understand him. But the difficulty was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had so little in common that it was almost im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to converse at any length. However, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it known that I was free to go and come as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased and that I was considered an honored guest</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some other sphere, and I was vastly amused</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he wished to know if I had dropped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. Evidently the creatures knew nothing of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">country beyond the mountain barrier, and in vain</seg><seg type="columnLine">I endeavored to explain how I had come over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains and to tell of the world on the other side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To him such a thing was incredible, as unbelievable</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his land would have been to me before I had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Then, after much trouble, he told me--if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can use the word "told" when no sounds issued</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him,--that no inhabitant of his country had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever passed those mountains, that beyond was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothingness and that his country comprised the</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND THE POLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">593</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">entire world. This was most astounding to me, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had come over the mountains without excessive</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty, and with their marvelous airships I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see no reason why they should not have soared above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peaks. But when I questioned the fellow, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">later talked with others, I learned to my amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the creatures perished miserably if they rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a few hundred feet above the earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their airships never attained a height of more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred feet and I was informed that too-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venturesome members of the community, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted to traverse the mountains, had gasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and died long before they reached the summits.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To them, strange as it may seem, an altitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred feet was as fatal as a dozen miles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">air to human beings. Whether this was due to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical peculiarities or to some peculiarity in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere I have never determined. I am of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion, however, that it is a little of both. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">air I am sure is far more rarefied than ours and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus of course would be unfit to sustain life even</seg><seg type="columnLine">at moderate heights, while being evolved from cru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">staceans--as I am positive they are--and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">modified gills instead of lungs, they are naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">less adaptable to changes in the density of air than</seg><seg type="columnLine">are human beings. Indeed, later, when I on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion tried to scale the mountains, I discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was with the utmost difficulty that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe, even when half way to the summits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this was not the reason why I was forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remain in this land even to the present time as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shall explain later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to resume my narrative of my experiences.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as I had finished my breakfast I started out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the sights. It was, however, some time before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I reached the outer air, for I found many most</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounding and interesting things to attract me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the underground residences of these strange crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The means of lighting the place was a puzzle, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I have said, the illumination was a sort of glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">that appeared to issue from the walls, floors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceilings, as if in fact they were made of translucent</seg><seg type="columnLine">material with lights behind them. I examined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">material carefully and found it was formed of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">continuous unbroken surface, as if moulded or cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">in place, as I found later it was. Also, I discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was the same material of which the airships</seg><seg type="columnLine">were made. Indeed, later on I found that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sole material these beings possessed for con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structing anything--that is, aside from wood which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seldom used and was rather a curiosity than</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise, and a tough grass which they considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">of little value, but from which a thin, light and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellent parchment-like material is made,--the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial in fact upon which this manuscript is written.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the amazing part of it is that the metallic-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance so widely used can be so altered or modi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied that it is adaptable for every purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It can be made opaque, transparent ©r trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucent; as hard as steel or as soft and plastic as</seg><seg type="columnLine">putty; as brittle as glass or as flexible as rubber.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It can be beaten or hammered like gold or copper;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it can be moulded by hand or machine and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardened, or it can be melted and cast. Moreover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it can be colored or tinted at will; it can be woven</seg><seg type="columnLine">like thread and it can be cut, bored or worked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">timber. By certain processes, too, it can be made*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to emit light indefinitely, while the light may yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">be turned off or on at will by means of some electri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal or similar power. This same mysterious force</seg><seg type="columnLine">serves these creatures in place of steam, heat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all other forms of power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was of course a long time before I learned all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, and I was still longer in learning the source</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the remarkable substance. Then, to my utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement I found it was sulphur! This statement</seg><seg type="columnLine">may seem incredible, for sulphur is so well known</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its properties so well understood that my fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low men will no doubt accuse me of telling a palp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able falsehood. But the secret lies in the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">these beings have discovered a property of sulphur</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which humans are wholly ignorant. This is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulphur is really a metal, the form knowm to us be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing only a salt or oxide, and it is the metallic sul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phur which these weird creatures use for such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude of purposes.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was, as I have said, a great surprise to me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover this, and I could not help thinking what</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous accomplishments might be ours if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed the knowledge of obtaining this metal. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never dreamed that a metallic material could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be obtained from sulphur, and at first it seemed un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">believable. But as I thought upon the matter, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that, after all, it was no more astonishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that aluminum metal could be secured from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soft rock called bauxite, many cargoes of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been carried in ships on which I had served.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later, too, J spent much time at the vast deposits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulphur which seem to underlie the whole country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although it has been used for countless ages, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">these beings have never had to do any mining, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are hills and plains composed entirely of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow stuff. Indeed, I was not long in deciding</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the whole place is nothing more than the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior of a huge volcano, or a series of volcanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">craters, which might partly account for the warmth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the climate, for no doubt there is still volcanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">activity and heat below the surface of the earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The processes_ used for refining the sulphur and</seg><seg type="columnLine">transforming it into metal were most interesting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I am no chemist and the technicalities are far</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond my powers to describe. There are huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">works that cover many square miles, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers are, I found, all of different types, forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and appearances from the other inhabitants. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact each art, profession, trade, and class, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings is, I soon found, distinct and has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolved or developed in such a way as to give the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest efficiency and best results along the lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of endeavor to which each is bound for life. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned the huge pincer-like claws of the sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diers, or rather police. In the same way diggers</seg><seg type="columnLine">have limbs adapted to their lahors; chemists possess</seg><seg type="columnLine">appendages as delicate as the most acurately de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vised instruments, and so on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to return to the sulphur and its uses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Among other things that interested me greatly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">(Note by Dr. Lyman).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           Wuunaware. that sacral chemists have de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared their belief that the element sulphur is derived from a metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">base. Although no one has yet produced metallic sulphur, yet that docs</seg><seg type="columnLine">not prove the incorrectness of such an hypothesis. Soda, potash anr</seg><seg type="columnLine">many other common chemicals, which bear no resemblance to metals</seg><seg type="columnLine">are merely salts or oxides of metals, although their metallic bases</seg><seg type="columnLine">were t«rnieriy unknown. Modern chemistry, however, has, as is weli</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, produced metallic sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">etc. --A. E: *-</seg><seg type="columnLine">594</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was the source of the marvelous power the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures use. This was, I found, derived from a pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culiar blackish and very heavy material which</seg><seg type="columnLine">exists in vast quantities near the sulphur deposits.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of itself it is of little value, although it is slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous and will cause sores like burns upon hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man skin as I discovered to my sorrow. But when</seg><seg type="columnLine">combined with the metallic sulphur, or with cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain by-products obtained in the manufacture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter, it produces most astonishing results. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">varying the combinations and the proportions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">materials it can be made to emit blinding light</seg><seg type="columnLine">which goes on continuously forever without in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least diminishing, or it can be made to explode with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a force greater than dynamite, while by still other</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods it may be made to produce invisible power</seg><seg type="columnLine">which can be harnessed as readily as steam and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be transmitted to great distances through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, like electricity, but without the use of wires.</seg><seg type="columnLine">About one hundred miles from the chief city is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense power house, if such it may be called, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this, power o* energy is sent broadcast over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole country. Thus, by having machines adapt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to the purpose, this source of power may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapped and used for any purpose, such as driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">airships, industrial work, turning on or off lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">etc. But the remarkable part of it, to me, is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that no machines, as we know such things, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">used. I have visited the plant several times and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet have never found a single wheel, shaft or crank</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it. There are merely immense chambers or vats</seg><seg type="columnLine">into which the various substance are run, and grid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like mazes of bars and sheets of metal. These are</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended over the vats and a ceaseless play of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many-colored and strangely tinted lights and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense heat seems to rush upward from the tanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to be absorbed by the odd apparatus overhead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">irom these it is led into a labyrinth of receptacles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a mystifying, to me, network of conduits, cables</seg><seg type="columnLine">and huge wires and up-standing rods. These scin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tillate with flashing lights and emit a cracking sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">and send the power in all directions. The strang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est thing about it, to my mind, is the fact that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures are not injured by this power, even when</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to it and while it is passing through their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies. At first I was deathly afraid of it, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed like terrific discharges of electricity; but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that even I could stand beside the generators,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or whatever they may be called, and that with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colorod flashes all about me and enveloping my body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt no ill effects. Rather, it gave me a pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingling sensation which left me exhilarated for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several days thereafter.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, aside from the metal and the power, many</seg><seg type="columnLine">other most valuable things are obtained from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulphur and the black rock. A vast number of by-</seg><seg type="columnLine">products result, and from these all or nearly all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">(Note by Dr. Lyman).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Probably the material described by Mr. Bishop is a very rich radio-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">active mineral nkin to or identical with prtclj-blcmie, and by combin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing this with derivatives of sulphur the marvelous powers of radium</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were harnessed. Just how the strange power was produced we can-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not say, for Mr. Bishop was of course ignorant of technicalities, as ho</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">states. I should imagine, however, that the power was generated by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">breaking down atoms by means of radio activity and thus releasing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the stupendous forces contained in them. This h3s long been a dream</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ol scientists, for it is well known that a single atom of matter contains</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">incalculable power or energy and that, if it were possible to break</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or explode atoms undreamed of force* would be at nun's disposal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Unquestionably the power described by Mr. Bishop was transmitted by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">means of elcctro-magnetic or similar waves.'*---A. £. tfe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the wants of the inhabitants are obtained. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange beverage I have mentioned was manu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">factured from a by-product, as are coloring mater-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ials, certain foods and many other things. Also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I have said, wood is regarded as a curiosity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is due to the fact that strangely enough there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are practically no real trees in this strange land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By this I do not mean that trees do not exist, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are great parks or gardens filled with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there are no wild trees, if I may use the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression. Ages ago, I understand, there were many,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but these were all utilized and exhausted and fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that trees would become extinct they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">preserved in parks as curiosities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only when they die is the wood available and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures prize this highly and treasure it as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were a most precious substance, using it as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might use gold or silver. Most of the country is</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with a coarse, sedgy grass, but there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">many forms of shrubs and plants and immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">areas of bare land which at first puzzled me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had seen no cultivated plants or gardens--ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept park-like places like botanical gardens--and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined that the bare areas were fields being pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared for cultivation, as I saw many of the beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">working in them. Imagine my wonder when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that these bare patches of earth provided the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants with their food. Countless years ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was informed, the beings had abandoned raising</seg><seg type="columnLine">food plants. The plants, so they discovered, merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew sustenance from the air and soil and trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed this to food fit to eat. And the creatures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoning that this process of nature was a round-</seg><seg type="columnLine">about method of making food, devised means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtaining their provisions from the air and earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct, doing away with the plants entirely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the edible materials thus obtained they</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the wafer-like biscuit I have referred to and</seg><seg type="columnLine">these, with their liquors and little pellets, form</seg><seg type="columnLine">their entire diet. Each class or variety of wafer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I learned, contained different food values of a vege-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table nature, while the pellets supplies the animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">mattei*, and by choosing these any taste or need</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be satisfied. Also, just as they secure pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions of a vegetable nature from the soil itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">without the time and trouble involved in raising</seg><seg type="columnLine">crops, so they manufacture the foods of an animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature from the vegetable products. Animals, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, merely transform the herbage they devour in</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meat, and such things, so why raise living crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures with great trouble and care and then slaughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, when the same materials, or at least material</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing the same nourishment and the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemicals, can be made direct?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And a word in regard to the animal life of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange country may be of interest to any humans</seg><seg type="columnLine">who find this document. At certain seasons, vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers of birds visit the great lakes or seas, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">are all of fresh watex', and I have found a great deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pleasure in watching these, for the albatrosses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mollymokes, gulls and other familiar birds come over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains from the world I once knew, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to me a bit like visitors and old friends from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my home. It was, in fact, these periodical visits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea fowl that gave me the idea of sending out</seg><seg type="columnLine">my manuscript, in the hope that some man might</seg><seg type="columnLine">find it. But to return to the animals that dwell</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. There are a number of the giant rat-lik§</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND THE POLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">595</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures, as large as kids, such as the one I killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and devoured when I first gained the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains, and there are many small birds, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside from these, no living creatures exist in a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">state. In zoos or museums are many most wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful creatures, some of which bear a resemblance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those on the other side of the world, but most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which are wholly different and many of which are</seg><seg type="columnLine">so astoundingly weird, gigantic or grotesque as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be horrifying, or to make me think I am dreaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">or delirious when I look at them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Some of these are gigantic reptiles with immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">scaly bodies and with heads covered with great bony</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates and armed with huge horns. They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocious looking creatures nearly fifty feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, but quite docile and harmless and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupid. Others resemble giant seals, but instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being covered with fur, their bodies are smooth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slimy, like eels. There are also creatures with</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormously long snake-like necks and great round</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies. These are water animals and should they</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen at sea they would be veritable sea-serpents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are several great beasts too, which appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be some sort of elephants, though vastly bigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any I have ever seen, and there are a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhinoceros-like animals, besides numbers of smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, such as deer, goats, beasts somewhat like</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponies, and giant turtles. Of carnivorous beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are none and I find nothing that at all re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembles an ox or sheep. All these I understand once</seg><seg type="columnLine">roamed the country wild, but were destroyed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange inhabitants until only those in captivity</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained. But perhaps the weirdest of all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures in the parks or zoos are the insects. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are butterflies whose wings spread a yard across,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies as big as turkeys, caterpillars with a girth</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater than my body and immense spiders with</seg><seg type="columnLine">six-foot, hairy legs and immense, staring, fiery red</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. These always give me a feeling of dread and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nausea as I look at them, and many a time I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened, screaming, from a nightmare wherein I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought myself being attacked by one of these hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible creatures. The natives, however, seem to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no fear of them and I have often seen the younger</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones, or if I may so call them the children, feeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monstrous spiders through the bars of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cages. These bars by the way are made of the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent form of the sulphur metal, and looking at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures, the bars are all but invisible--as are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cages--so that one seems to see a horrible beast un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">confined and ready to spring at one. But of all the in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sects, those which interest me most are the giant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants. These are as large as good-sized dogs and are</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept in a vast pit-like enclosure. Here they hurry</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, and labor ceaselessly, building huge mounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and digging tunnels, only to tear them down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">start over again. They are the most ferocious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the animals also, and if one of their number</seg><seg type="columnLine">is injured or sick, the others, after carefully ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amining him, tear him to bits and devour his still</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving body. On one occasion a great lizard-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast died and his carcass was thrown into the ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit and I fairly shook with terror as I watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures, gnawing him to bits and with incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength dragging the immense body here and there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Often, too, the ants seem to be drilling and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to possess intelligences almost human. Often</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think what terrible havoc they would play should</seg><seg type="columnLine">they escape from their den, but I am assured that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is impossible, as the frail looking fence that</seg><seg type="columnLine">borders the pit is made of a material that is certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">death to any ant that touches it. Indeed, I heard, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I may use that term, the story of these ants. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems that ages ago,--these beings have no means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">recording time by the way,--the ants roamed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">large and destroyed the inabitants everywhere. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant war was waged between the two races and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody battles were fought. In a way it was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the Indian warfare at home, though far more</seg><seg type="columnLine">merciless and cruel, for each side made slaves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their captives and gave no quarter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the crustacean-like beings made a discovery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They found vast numbers of dead ants where an</seg><seg type="columnLine">invading army had moved across a great pile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste material from the sulphur works, and by test-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing this on captive ants they found that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant death to the creatures. This enabled them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to exterminate their hereditary enemies, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">material was made in stupendous quantities and</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed in a great wall or pile about the advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">host of the inhabitants. Thus guarded, the ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were powerless to harm them, and gradually all but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few of the ants were utterly destroyed. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">few survivors were made prisoners and confined</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it is the descendants of these that are in the pit</seg><seg type="columnLine">today.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since then, so I understand, there have been no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wars or battles in the entire land and the soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">or police are being done away with, as there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">really no need for them. No more soldiers are bred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a few years none of the old ones will remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  {To be concluded in the November issue)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Into the Fourth Dimension</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By RAY CUMMINGS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Author of the "Girl of the Golden Atom", and "Around the Universe''.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS new story by Ray Cummings will not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">entertain you but will mystify you as well.

The excitement spread to the crowd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they pressed upon Us with wondering looks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A minute or two passed in this helpless agitation,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and then the car gave a lurch, and a second later it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rose from the platform!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Edmund cried out in helpless, passionate fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In a moment the car was a yard above the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, and gathering speed. I felt my heart sink.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edmund became, if possible, paler than before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Hold it! Hold it!" he shouted, and with him I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to grasp the smooth, polished walls that slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from our hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At this moment there was a rush in the crowd-</seg><seg type="columnLine">People were flung aside, and to my amazement, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car rose in the air, I saw Juba make a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap, seize the steel grating covering one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows, and soar away with the machine like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge baboon hanging on the outside of a cage,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then the car shot toward the sky!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           CHAPTER XVII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           To the Rescue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALOW exclamation, magnified by the mult-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itude of strange voices into a mighty mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mur, rose from the crowd, and every eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed the retreating car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In this emergency all of Edmund's sagacity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Self-command instantly came back. He wa3 once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more the cool, resourceful master of the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "An aeroplane!" he shouted, and at the word</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang toward one of the floating machines beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Brushing aside the engineer, in a moment he had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the machine in control. Jack and I were upon his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heels, but Henry was not quick enough, and was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">left behind. There were only four or five men, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crew of the plane, on the craft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With a skill and rapidity that astonished me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as I knew his capacity, Edmund swung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge machine round and, with reckless disregard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of consequences, set the driving-screws whirring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their highest speed. The great tower seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">melt away behind us, so quickly did we leave it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But it was a mad chase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                 A Race Begins</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHAT could this air-driven craft do against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car impelled by the mysterious interatomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">force?

His eyes shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he drove the machinery of the plane to its ut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most limit. The crew were stupefied, and offered no</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ^ "We must not lose sight of them," said Edmund,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his self-control becoming more perfect as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes passed. "We must never lose sight of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an instant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But surely," I exclaimed, "you cannot hope to</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtake them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he said almost fiercely, "I hope even that!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remember," he added more coolly, "that Ingra</seg><seg type="columnLine">really knows nothing of the management of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trollers. He has watched me operate them long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to know how to start the car; unless Heaven</seg><seg type="columnLine">is against us, he will not be able to work it up to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">best speed, and he can hardly direct it with cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty. At any moment he may find himself des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cending. Heaven grant that they do not come</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with a rush."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there is Ala," I said.

And what can he do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If they are aware of his presence," I suggested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"perhaps Ala may find a way to communicate with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and aid him in his efforts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The idea seemed to strike Edmund, and he joy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully replied:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes, surely she will find a way. She is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great woman--a woman to trust in an emergency.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What a brave act that was of Juba's I Who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have dreamed that under his shaggy exterior there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a heart of gold, and so quick a brain?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was the head blacksmith in the cavern," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack. "If there is any way to get into that car, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will find it"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It can only be done by aid from within," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edmund.

But we must keep them in sight.

If ho could stay there to the end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might be of estimable service when the crisis</seg><seg type="columnLine">should arrive</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Question of Elevation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT first I was somewhat surprised that Edmund</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept at so low an elevation compared with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fleeing car. We were not more than a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile above the ground, while the object of our pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit was at least three miles high. But in a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">while it became obvious that the course which Ed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mund had adopted was a very wise one. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first place, by keeping at a low elevation we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">always see the car projected against the bright sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was thus less danger of its escaping us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the next place, as Edmund pointed out, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car came down, as it must do some time, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could cut in under it, so to speak, and approach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing-point along a base-line shorter than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diagonal that the car would have to pursue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The higher he goes," said Edmund, "the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">our advantage will be. Fortunately, he seems to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising all the time. There is no danger that he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">run away in that direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has no conception of anything above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud-dome, and his only object is to get as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away as possible, in order to defy pursuit before</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing. I expect every moment, now, to see him</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin to descend."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But are you sure that he can manipulate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controllers well enough to make a safe descent?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us pray that he can," replied Edmund. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will give him credit for great intelligence. If ho</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not possess extraordinary capacity, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have learned, simply by watching me, how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">run the machinery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The fact that he could penetrate so far gives</seg><seg type="columnLine">me hope, that he has learned enough to insure their</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety. The highspeed controllers, used when</seg><seg type="columnLine">astride the atmosphere, are in a different location</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the others, and are manipulated somewhat dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did not touch them during our journey, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have little fear that he will discover their use. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is now evident that we can at least keep the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The resistance of this dense atmosphere is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious obstacle to a machine which, unlike the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, does not derive an advantage from that very</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An Alarm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE Were now many miles from the capital, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling toward the tropical belt. It was evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent that Ingra intended to take refuge again in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderness, though at a point far distant from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where we had so recently encountered him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ala has told me," said Edmund, "that Ingra,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who is very fond of wild sports, and who until our</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival seems to have exhibited no evil characteris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tics, has a number of hunting-lodges in this vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderness, and it was due to the unlucky fate that</seg><seg type="columnLine">guided us in our descent that we fell into his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For, unknowingly, we came down within a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile of one of his lodges. He always has a retinue</seg><seg type="columnLine">in attendance at his lodges, and probably he is now</seg><seg type="columnLine">making for one of these places."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think they are aware that we are follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course, they will expect to be pursued, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">600</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I am in hopes that Ingra has not seen us, and does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know that we have kept within eyesight. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember that the car has no window in the rear--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mistake of construction which until now I have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gretted. It has not swerved from its course since</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting, and I have been careful to keep directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Consequently, there is every reason to think!</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Ingra, trusting to the speed of the car, has not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even taken the trouble to look behind. Besides, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have kept comparatively close to the ground, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is not easy to see us from a distance, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I perceive the car beginning to descend I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall run down to the very tree-tops in order to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the better concealed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our hopes now rose high. We had demonstrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ability to keep the car in view, though, to be sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had become little more than a dark speck in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, and its steady motion relieved our anxiety con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerning a possible disaster from Ingra's inability</seg><seg type="columnLine">to manage it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several hours passed, and once more we had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inhabited lands behind and were passing over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the border of the wilderness, where the luxuriance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the vegetation surpassed that of the Amazonian</seg><seg type="columnLine">forests of the wilds of Borneo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, Edmund uttered an exclamation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great Heavens!" he cried. "Look! Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">is wrong. It is all to end in disaster at last!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fear of Losing the Car</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JACK and I, startled by Edmund's agitation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at the distant car. It was falling from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It shot hither and thither, sweeping in long de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scending curves, and darting to one side and a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nother, like a collapsed balloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What can have happened?" I exclaimed. "Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heavens! If Juba should be flung off now, our only</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally would be lost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No; we have another," said Edmund quietly, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his self-mastery asserting itself--"Ala, herself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look," he continued, a moment afterward, "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car rights itself. It will come down all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was so. The eccentric movements ceased, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw the car descending rapidly, but with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady motion which indicated that it was again un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der control. During the ten minutes that the wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumble lasted, it had fallen within half a mile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, and now it was gliding swiftly away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us, over the top of the great forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Edmund strove to increase our speed, making the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bilent engineer and his men aid him with their ut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most exertions. Glancing behind, I now noticed, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time, that several airplanes were pursuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">us; but they were far behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had probably started in pursuit as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible after our chase began, but we had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so absorbed in watching the car that we had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even thought of looking behind. We had trusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely to ourselves, but now I felt a satisfaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">in knowing that we should have assistance in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I called Edmund's attention to our pursuers, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gave no heed. His whole mind and soul were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed upon the car. In a little while it had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended so low that it became necessary for us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise, in order to keep it in view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless, as Edmund had foreseen, our course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying so near the ground, had given us a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage, and we had drawn preceptibly nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">while running for the point toward which the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">was descending. Still, it now became very difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep the object of our pursuit in view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At times we lost sight of it entirely against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark background of foliage. But an occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam from the polished sides of the car enabled</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to retain a general notion of its location.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Battle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT last it dropped into the great sea of vegeta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and was completely lost. At this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were apparently, about three miles behind It.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Keep your eyes fixed on the point where it dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared," said Edmund. "Don't let your sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">waver. I shall make straight for the place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortune favored us, for at the spot where the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sunk from sight a group of enormous trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted their mighty tops high above the general sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the forest, and this landmark was invaluable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we had run within an eighth of a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these trees, Edmund at last slowed up, and got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the airplane under perfect control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We crept silently above the tree-tops, every eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed upon the spot where we expected at any mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment to see the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly a forest glade appeared, shadowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the very trees that had served as our guides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was the car resting upon the ground!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door was toward us, and open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In it stood Ala, looking with a horrified coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenance upon a spectacle that might well have</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen her blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ingra and Juba were engaged in a terrific bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle. At one moment they rolled upon the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked together, looking like a man and a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast at death-grips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each was fiercely exerting his utmost strength.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now one, now the other, was on top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each endeavoring to throttle the other, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolved so rapidly that the eye could hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow the successive phases of the struggle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly they rolled against a rock, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock releasing their hold, both leaped to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. But neither flinched, nor gave back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They sprang together again with demoniac</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury, Juba's huge eyes blazing out of the wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle of his hair, while his huge, shaggy arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembled those of a bear rushing madly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">death-hug.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ingra was a foe worthy to encounter so</seg><seg type="columnLine">formidable an antagonist. With amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and agility, he hurled his assailant back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and then, to my horror, I saw that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">his long knife in his hand, while Juba had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Juba a Fighter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LOWERING his form as he sped to the onset,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a wicked lunge, Ingra darted up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his foe. For an instant I thought that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade had reached the vitals of his antagonist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Juba staggered backward, but a second later</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ingra shot away as if the walking-beam of an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">A COLUMBUS OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">601</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gine had struck him, and fell, stunned and mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Juba's mighty foot had been propelled against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest, for, like a Frenchman, the creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought with arms and legs alike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now you have him!" shouted Jack, dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with excitement, as Edmund swept the airplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the spot.

We must</seg><seg type="columnLine">face the consequences, and probably there was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of us who did not feel an unuttered forebod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of disaster.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he deserved her thanks because, but for his pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, Ingra would have abducted Ala as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car landed, and we should have arrived too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had hardly reached the car again when one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pursuing planes came up, and close after</seg><seg type="columnLine">it followed several more. They brought a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of court officials and attendants, who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite in the dark as to the meaning of this ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traordinary escapade. For, it will be remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered, there had been no time to tell anybody of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of Ingra in the car when we arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ala explained the situation, and the excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her friends was laughable. They ran about in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the underbrush, anxious to show their devotion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and possibly thinking that they would find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fugitive concealed close at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ala recalled them; and, as more planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived, organized the search with a rapidity that</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased my respect for her ability. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one remarkable feature in her intercourse with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her people that struck me with great force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was a queen, and she had the look and bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of one when she chose to assert her author-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity; but there was no appearance of servility in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manner of those surrounding her, and she de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded none. If ever there was a democratic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Queen, it was she. Everybody recognized her</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank, but it was rather with evidences of admira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and love than of mere submission.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes she had arranged her plan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Airplanes were sent scouting over the forest in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions with orders to search every nook where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ingra might be in hiding. Then s"he turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edmund, and they communed together for a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we awaited the result of their consultation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The decision, apparently somewhat against, Ed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mund's opinion, for he wished to aid in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">search, was to return at once to the capital. Ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cordingly, we embarked in the car; and were soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeding away from the wilderness, leaving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen of the planes to prosecute the search.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After our return to the capital a very different</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of events began to occupy our attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of Ingra we heard no more, for the present.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One by one the air planes that had been left to hunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">him down returned unsuccessful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was certain that he had adherents in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, as he had elsewhere, for his family was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">old and powerful, and had always occupied an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alted position; but still we saw nothing to alarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Nevertheless, we never doubted that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply biding his time and planning his ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To me the thought became an obsession, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes I could hardly sleep on account of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was horrible to think of our being practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone here in this distant world, among a peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple who knew nothing of our ways, and who</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated us with respect only because in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">place we excited their curiosity, and in the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">place because Ala's favor was our shield.</seg><seg type="columnLine">602</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I could not get away from the fear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the novelty should be over the romantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">attachment which their queen had formed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edmund would cease to captivate the public's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancy, and then the scale would incline against</seg><seg type="columnLine">us.

He seemed to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of masculine pythoness, and his gloomy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavernous apartment in the center of the temple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely lighted with huge, dull-red electric globes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was apparently a Delphic shrine for the people of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The High Priest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS our first introduction to any thing resem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling superstition among these people, and to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least, it came as a great surprise, for in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">world of light, beauty, and harmony, such a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed strikingly out of place. The evident awe</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which Ala regarded this high priest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery displeased me also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Contrary to what one might expect, this man, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of extraordinary stature, I should say nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven feet tall, showed no signs of age. He seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be in middle life, and very vigorous; and, as he sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a kind of throne of some black, highly polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, with his elbow resting on a short pillar cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped with a circlet of red jewels that blazed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">living coals, his huge head and strong face were</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelously impressive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I never saw such a face anywhere else.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose was immense, resembling a great curved beak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his deep-sunk eyes, roofed with projecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows, were as black as jet, but curiously luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they gleamed sidewise out of their pent-house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when he turned his full face, even Edmund</seg><seg type="columnLine">started back.

The scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasted only two or three minutes. When the chant</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finished, the oracular speaker slowly sank back</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his throne and turned away his face, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become once more as impassive as marble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ala could hardly remain upright.

Natural-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, it would require time to develop its force. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a struggle between two opponents of equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, for if the "Big Medicine Man," as Jack con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued, to call him, was supreme in religious affairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ala was nevertheless queen, and her popularity was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bulwark to her authority.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Besides, so far as we knew, the affair was a secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">known only to the persons immediately concerned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There had been no witnesses of the scene before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black throne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime, Ala showed as little anxiety as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edmund. She was almost continually with us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time glided away very pleasantly With the enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainments which she was constantly providing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">our amusement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Color Music</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUR attention was now once more turned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery of the color music. It was perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear, after what we had learned in the wildness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the play of colors which had so astonished us</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnished but a part of the esthetic enjoyment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frequently there were what I may call concerts</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the palace, and on these occasions I became con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced that more than half of the effect produced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dramatic harmonies that gushed in glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves of color from the great circles on the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">was due to the production of sounds inaudible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Edmund, as I had anticipated that he would do</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his remark in reply to Jack's enthusiastic de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand when the secret of the singing birds first</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst upon us, attacked the problem by rendering</seg><seg type="columnLine">this strange music audible to us. And he succeeded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he always succeeded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How he did it I cannot pretend to explain, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said that it was as simple in principle as a tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone. After many experiments he constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">three little boxes, one for each of us, and when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had attached them over our ears we could actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the sounds produced by the colored undulations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I can never describe those sounds. They thrilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very soul. They had a strange aerial quality, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they were the voices of spirits floating in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us. The music that they produced reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, by the sweetness of its melodies, of an iEolian</seg><seg type="columnLine">harp; but it was more measured, and infinitely more</seg><seg type="columnLine">varied. Listening to it, we felt stirred to depths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our being of whose existence we had not dreamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were exalted, and something beyond human</seg><seg type="columnLine">capacities of enjoyment seemed to have been given</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us. Yet Edmund said that the exquisite pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were enabled to experience by the aid of his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trivances was only a rude, imperfect, mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">reproduction of that which was enjoyed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of Venus. But we were grateful to him for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">affording us this glimpse into the possibilities of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">transcendent development of the physical senses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the nature of Venus," Edmund declared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This world so near the sun receives from the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">orb richer gifts than come to the earth.

I had an uneasy feeling that in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner Ingra would associate himself with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the people, and even the high officials in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the palace, apparently knew nothing of what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred, I felt certain tha£ our arch-enemy would</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn of it and remorselessly pursue the advantage</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it gave him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again and again I was on the point of urging</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edmund to leave the planet while there was yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and take Ala with us, if she would consent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go, as he had himself suggested. He was so ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed in his schemes, however, that I hesitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to disturb his thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a short time all our preparations were made,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we set out on what I must regard as the wildest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most inconsiderate adventure that we had yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">undertaken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We started, as usual, from the great tower of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace, our company consisting of eight persons, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the car could conveniently accommodate. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprised, beside ourselves, Ala, Juba, two maids</seg><seg type="columnLine">chosen from Ala's immediate attendants, and a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">official of the palace--a sort of majordomo--a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent person and of great physical strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course we had our weapons, both the pistols</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the guns, with an abundance of ammunition</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of provisions. We were attended by half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen airplanes, which were to accompany us as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as they could go, and were there to await our</seg><seg type="columnLine">return from the unknown region.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Wonders of Venus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE took the direction of the mines; and beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">them we entered the wilderness, and soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">found ourselves involved in the zone of clouds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">semi-darkness. Here, at a point where a curiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped mountain peak, rising just on the border of</seg><seg type="columnLine">A COLUMBUS OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the twilight-land and pointing its bold outlines</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the strongly illuminated sky behind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">served as a landmark which we could not miss on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our return, the airplanes were ordered to await us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we pushed on alone with the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Jack, of course, was all alive for this adventure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he always was for anything promising excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment; but Henry didn't like it, and would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed behind if he had had the courage to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone among strangers. For my part, my curiosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">was greatly aroused; and, besides I found immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in watching the enthusiasm of Ala.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Her adventurous spirit was in its element; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as appearances went, she gave no thought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">future troubles. According to custom, the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">of things at the capital had been left in charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of board of regency, which was a permanent</seg><seg type="columnLine">institution, as I learned, Ala not being the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen who was fond of visiting distant parts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, though she was the first who had shown a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposition to explore unknown regions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On leaving the airplanes behind, we plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper and deeper into gloom, and were compelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use our electric lights. Among Edmund's special</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparations was a small search-light, placed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peep-hole in the front end of the car, and this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now brought into requisition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt; It gave us startling views of the nature of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface beneath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First we ran for many miles above an area</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with vast swamps and bogs, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oddest conceivable shapes of vegetation. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen to see some of the gigantic animals which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, from our first startling experience, inhab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ited this region, and it was not long before the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">found one out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were about a hundred feet above the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and proceeding slowly, when Edmund, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed himself beside the search-light and was peer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the opening, said quietly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There! Would you like to take a look?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ala was beside him in a moment, and she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not repress an exclamation, or refrain from starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward, although in a second she recovered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at her own nervousness. There was room</seg><seg type="columnLine">for only one, beside Edmund, at the little window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when Ala had satisfied her curiosity we each</seg><seg type="columnLine">took our turn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When mine came I was for an instant almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much agitated as Ala had been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Strange Monster</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DIRECTLY ahead of us, not more than seventy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five yards distant, there was a shallow pond,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its banks thick with tangled bushes, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of it stood a monster on eight legs, tawny-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored in the electric light, seeming to bristle with</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff hairs all over its huge round body. Its head was</seg><seg type="columnLine">relatively small, black, and apparently armored with</seg><seg type="columnLine">polished jet, and faceted with innumerable eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which flamed in the brilliant beam poured upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord!" I could not but exclaim. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a prodigious tarantula! Look!

Get away a moment, and I'll</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">swing the car round. We'll give him a broadside</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he becomes too ugly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  _ Accordingly, the car was swung into such a posi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion that one of the side windows faced the crea-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ture, and Edmund brought the movable search-light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the window, which he threw wide open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "For Heaven's sake!" cried Henry.

We are two hundred feet away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All of us crowded about the window, and it is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unnecessary to say that the automatic guns were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in our hands and the pistols ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  During the few seconds that the streaming light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had been removed the monster had changed his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">position; and now, as the glare fell upon him again,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we were startled to find that he had approached us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was within forty feet of the car, standing in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grassy glade, having with inconceivable rapidity</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and agility clambered or leaped over the stunted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trees and bushes surrounding the pond in which we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had first seen him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His huge spiky body seemed to bristle with anger,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and his countless eyes blazed like so many great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rubies in the piercing light. It was truly a heart-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quaking sight!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ala started back with a womanly cry of alarm;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and Henry, I am almost ashamed to say, sank help-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">less upon a bench.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I believe he is going to jump at us," said Ed-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mund quietly.

I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">not going to be scared out by a beast like that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've finished him, and that ends it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first Edmund insisted; but Jack was so ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinate, and he really seemed so strong, that at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length Edmund said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we'll go on a little way. If Jack seems to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the worse for it, we'll put back again at top</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So it was decided, and we kept on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one had any desire to examine the monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had slain. But Edmund declared that in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interests of science he ought at least to photograph</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a flash-light; and we did pause long enough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for that, hovering over the place with the car, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the picture when developed showed nothing but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No other adventure happened at once, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw no more of the strange inhabitants of the fens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had probably been scared off by the noise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time we bore away in the darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without any guide except a general sense of direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. In that respect Edmund was the most re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable person I have ever known. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible for him to be lost. He could make his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through the air like a migrating bird.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a long while it began to grow a little lighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. I though that we had inadvertently turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on our course and were approaching the temperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">zone; but Edmund averred that he had not lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">his direction, and that the light must come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other source. Before the darkness around us</seg><seg type="columnLine">had begun perceptibly to lift I happened to glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of one of the windows, and noticed a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluttering in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Huge inky shadows seemed to be flitting through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Strange Shadows</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PRESENTLY there cams a smart blow against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car, and for an instant something covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window. Everybody was greatly startled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we looked out at both sides, but could see nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except the curious shadows that I had first noticed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air was misty around us; and the shadows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for their blackness, resembled apparitions</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the spectre of the Brocken, cut upon the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog by moving objects, whose position we could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately determine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is something odd overhead," said Ed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mund at length, "and I'll steer a little higher to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No sooner had the car started gliding on an up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward slope than a perfect thunder of raps began</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the outside, like heavy hail on a roof. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time both of the windows were covered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving forms, the nature of which we could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">determine, so fast did they flit by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was evident that they were hitting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car and causing the noise. Suddenly the rapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased and the forms disappeared from the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows. But now again the ebon shadows began</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluttering in the mist all about the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What has become of those things, and what are</seg><seg type="columnLine">they, anyhow?" demanded Jack nervously. Owing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his comparative helplessness, he was no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">more startled and alarmed than he would otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know what they are," Edmund replied;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but I do know that they are overhead again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to keep the car rising until I find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the mystery means."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what makes the shadows?" I asked. "Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">does the light come from?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course it must come from above," Edmund</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied, "since the shadows are below our level and</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear all around us. I take it that the sun is</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking through the clouds overhead. But what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the objects are that cast the shadows I can't guess.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That they are very much alive, and that their name</seg><seg type="columnLine">A COLUMBUS OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">607</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">is legion, are facts which require no demonstration</seg><seg type="columnLine">after our recent experience."	a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this time we were rising, and in a few' mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments the strange phenomenon recurred. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder of blows again fell upon the car, and the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguishable rush by the windows was resumed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ala turned slightly pale, her maids cowered to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, Henry hid his face, and even Edmund</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed disconcerted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's very strange," he muttered. "I'll have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn on the search-light."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Flock of Bats</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS had been extinguished upon the closing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass of the window when we resumed our</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey, Edmund not taking the trouble then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">replace the apparatus at the forward lookout. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">now put the light in its original position, and, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">its brilliant beam sprang out into the darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed himself close by the small opening. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment of intense gazing he looked back over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder with a queer expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Catching my eye, he beckoned to me, and I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look out there!" he said in a low voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I did so I was unable to repress an exclama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. The shaft of light fell upon thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge flapping wings, belonging to what I can only</seg><seg type="columnLine">liken to enormous bats, which were whirling about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car and blindly striking by hundreds against</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, as they rushed on in an endless procession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon it became apparent that they were revolving</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a vast circle; and their previous sudden disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance was explained when, as if at a signal, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">all turned their flight upward and rose again above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the level of the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The things looked so uncanny that I shuddered</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the recollection of the sight, while Edmund</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed lost in thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" called out Jack impatiently from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bench. "What do you see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I was trying to frame an answer Edmund</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke up in words that filled me with surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the next step to Hades, I reckon," is what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack didn't catch his drift, and I had to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment before I asked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What in the world do you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I mean this," replied Edmund, seizing one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knobs and giving it a sudden turn. "We've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get up out of here before the tempest strikes us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You don't think that they can harm us, do you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said, with my mind on the flying creatures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not they, but what they announce. Hold on</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight now, for I am going to make her spin."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before touching the knob again, he took Ala by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the band and made her sit on one of the benches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing her how to hold herself firmly in position.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he planted himself by his controllers, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment later we felt the car bound upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Tempest on Venus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT the warning which Edmund had read in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conduct of the gigantic birds had come too late.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We shot through their array, knocking them right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left by thousands as we rushed upward; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deafening sound thus created was nothing to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful uproar that immediately succeeded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned dizzy as the car began to spin and plung®</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a cork in a whirlpool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were caught in a tempest with a vengeance!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was getting lighter outside, but the light was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more fearful than the darkness. It was a lurid red</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam that made the boiling clouds which surged</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the windows resemble foam upon a sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood whipped to madness by furiously battling</seg><seg type="columnLine">winds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that we had experienced in the terrible pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage of the crystal mountains was child's play to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The howling and shrieking of the wind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to drive one mad. It seemed to blow a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen ways at once. The car rolled, bobbed, tossed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plunged, and, despite all our efforts, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung upon the floor, striking against one another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasping at supports, out of breath, helpless with</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror, all shouting at intervals and nobody hearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word in the hubbub of noises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Edmund abandoned all efforts to control the car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and devoted himself to saving Ala as much as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He held her in his arms, and braced himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a corner where two of the benches running along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls met. Even in that terible excitement I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed a look of confidence in her face as she fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes upon Edmund. Jack suffered fearfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shocks he received, and I did my best to</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once I caught Edmund's eye, and he glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaningly upward, which I took for an intimation</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the car was still rising, and that he looked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliverance from our peril in that way. But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">W'ere certainly times when we plunged downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fearful speed, for we would be almost lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the floor by the inertia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This dreadful scene may have lasted an hour, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">it may have lasted not more than twenty minutes;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it seemed endless. The change came with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One moment we were rolling and pitching, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual, and the next--it was all over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Danger Over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'"pHE car seemed to have been struck dead, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">A so absolutely motionless. At the same instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">the howling of the wind passed away in a dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream. My ears rang still with the echo, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too dizzy to stand straight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few moments it became evident that the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionlessness of the car was only apparent. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still rising. Edmund gently placed Ala on a bench</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went to the controllers. After turning a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of knobs, he faced about with a cheering smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are out of it," he said. "There is no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger. The only thing there w'as to do was to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">on rising.

The sun was shining brilliantly over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and its light fell upon a raging sea of clouds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, except at their edges, where they were torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">into flying scud, looked as dense as white molten</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hundred tornadoes appeared to be whizzing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, all turning in the same direction with sicken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing velocity; and where these whirlwinds came to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, their peripheries moving opposite ways, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as if two gigantic buzz-saws had met, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">plowing the other to pieces and whirling the frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments round in the wildest confusion. The play of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning was fierce and incessant; but when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the midst of it, it had passed unnoticed, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder being blended with the roar of the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Heavens!" cried Jack, holding himself pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully erect at the window. "Did we come through</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Indeed we did," replied Edmund, "and I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind saying that I shouldn't like to venture such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what does it all mean?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Its meaning is clear enough. In penetrating to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the torrid circle, where the unsetting sun is</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever in the zenith, we have entered the zone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempests that surrounds it.

Jack seems to be getting along pretty well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by keeping near the upper limit of the atmo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere we can travel so fast that the whole trip will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not occupy more than twenty-four hours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's it," cried Jack; "that suits me exactly. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back the way we came would look as if we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been beaten."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The talk of going back set my mind once more on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dangers that were probably gathering for us at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the capital, and I could not refrain from saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly to Edmund:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know you ought to get back as soon as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, for I am sure there are plots hatching that</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have terrible consequences.

We had already seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of its results in the belt of cyclones, but as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed over that and entered the central torrid cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cle, we beheld, if possible, still more dreadful in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dications of the merciless action of the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we had left the region of clouds and storms</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, the bare surface of the planet became visi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble, and Edmund kept one side of the car inclined</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward to give us a better view from the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Desert on Venus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE were many miles above the ground, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller details were not visible even with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">binoculars; but we did not dare to drop lower be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the heat, which, in spite of our great dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, came to our faces, even through the thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass, like the blast of a furnace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Evidently, no life could exist on that scorched sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, and not a drop of water could stay there.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way the transit of the torrid circle, though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thousands of miles broad, was effected in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, and upon approaching the opposite border we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw again the ring of swirling clouds that encloses</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack, who was now rapidly recovering the use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his limbs, stood with us most of the time at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window; and as he saw the clouds passing far be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath, the thought seemed for the first time to strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind that in circumnavigating the planet we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should once more visit the scene of our first adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture on the dark hemisphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Jove, Edmund," he suddenly sang out, "we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to cross those mountains again!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course we will," said Edmund, "but it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a simple matter now.

"He likes our company too well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   But Edmund's words and manner set me to worry-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing again about what was going an behind our backs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the capital; and I was impatient to return and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have it out, and then get away for good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Edmund saw the trend of my thoughts--I believe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he was beginning to acquire something of Ala's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">power of mind-reading--and he said to me, in an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aside:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Don't be so down-hearted. It'll come out all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">right. Keep your courage up, and help me with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">others."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   We passed over the storm-zone at high speed, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then came the temperate, or inhabited, zone; but the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">part of it now beneath our eyes was on the opposite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side of the planet from the capital. It appeared to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be dotted with villages; and occasionally the towers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of a considerable city were visible. Ala, however,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">informed Edmund that this portion of Venus was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mainly devoted to agriculture, and contained no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great towers. We were so high that the airplanes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in sight seemed to be crawling upon the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Leaving the Night Hemisphere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A NOTHER belt of clouds ahead soon reminded us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that we were rapidly approaching the borders</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the night hemisphere, and our expectations be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came eagerly alive. Ala, especially, was nervously</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">excitable over the prospect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Now, at last, she was to enter that mysterious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">country which none of her people had ever succeeded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in penetrating, and concerning which so many su-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perstitions and traditions existed. The majestic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">majordomo, who had behaved with commendable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">equanimity through all of our adventures thus far,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">showed a little nervousness, I thought, when Ala</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">explained to him what was about to happen. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">watched Juba closely, but his face was impassive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The night hemisphere, you will remember, is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ringed outside the crystal mountains by another zone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of tempests and a broad sea into which the rivers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">periodically formed by the melting ice pour. Wd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were now so high that the storms did not trouble us;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and we admired, at our leisure, the shining expanse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of sea surface, whitened with foam, that showed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through shifting breaks in the tempestuous clouds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Presently, Edmund, who had been watching from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the lookout, slowed down and swung the car half-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Now's your chance," he said. "Take a look at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the mountains before we cross them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We all crowded round the window. There they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lay, those terrific ice peaks, in a long glittering line</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon the horizon. Their tops were wreathed in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">straggling clouds, through which occasionally darted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a diamond-bright flash where the level sunlight was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reflected from some smooth flank of pure ice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I wonder if we can see the place where we were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">imprisoned by the fall of the car?" said Jack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No," Edmund replied. "That is over on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other side. Remember we are approaching the dark</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hemisphere at a point opposite to where we left;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But the snow mountains' seem just the same</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An Arctic Cold on Venus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ccnpO be sure.

Gradually'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a marvelous scene opened around us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The air seemed to darken, and the stars began to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">appear. These grew brighter as the night deepened,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and soon they glowed with inci'eATEle brfBfeitcy. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was so long since my eyes had beheld item, that I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was astonished by their brightness and their mul-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">titude. But the effect upon Ala and her atteniants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was indescribable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  You must remember that none of them had ever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seen a star before, and now suddenly they bcfcdfd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thousands. They could not comprehend the meaning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the wonderful spectacle. It was such a revelaffen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the universe as they had never dreamed of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   When we had passed completely wifcfem ffie realm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of darkness, with the crystal mountains oifte more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flaming in fiery shapes behind us, Edinurid brought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the car to rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   He had already started the electric heaters and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clothed Ala in furs, and now the rest of tfs got out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">our arctic garments from the lockers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "I am now preparing to drop down to the ground,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Edmund said, "in order to take our bearings. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">few observations of the stars will enable me to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">orient myself, arid then we can set out with con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fidence in search of the caverns."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The descent was made rapidly, and then, in our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">warm clothing, we stepped out of the car upon tho</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">icy shingle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Ala shivered at the touch of the glacial air, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her maids and the majordomo quickly fled back into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the shelter of the car. But Edmund wished Ala to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">remain outside, and he doubled the furs covering her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">until she intimated that she no longer felt any dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">comfort from the cold. Then he got out his instru-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ments of observation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   But first he pointed out the earth and the moon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to Ala. That was a thrilling moment to all of us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   How splendid our old planet looked up there, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">how proud we felt as we watched Edmund endeavor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing to make his companion comprehend what it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that she saw. I think that he succeeded, at least</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so far that she understood that it was our world</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which shone so splendidly overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Do you understand what this means?" asked Ed-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mund, suddenly turning to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I understand that that is the earth, of course,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But, are you not surprised to find it still so high</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">overhead here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the truth burst upon me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Year of the Venus Calendar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">«TTfHY, yes!" I exclaimed; "it means that a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">V t whole year has elapsed since we arrived upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">610</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus. She has gone round her orbit, and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into conjunction with the earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More than a year," Edmund replied. "Some five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and eighty days; for that is about the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one conjunction to the next."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you mean to say that we have been here al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most twenty months?" cried Jack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'There is the evidence," Edmund responded. "As-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronomy doesn't lie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Jack, "it's the shortest twenty months</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my experience."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henry, after his fashion, said nothing, but looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomy and disgruntled in the glare of the electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">light streaming from the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having finished his observations, Edmund an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced that he now knew his course and could take</seg><seg type="columnLine">us directly to the caverns of Juba's people. But, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore entering the car, he took Ala again by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, and they stood together for a long time, gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at the earth and the stars, while he communed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her, telling her, in that strange language, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know not what marvelous things which must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been revelations of enormous significance to her in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I can see them yet, standing there side by side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I can recall the very expression of her beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, peering out of the hooding furs, as she drank</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his thoughts, with a look of mingled love, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration, and confidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length we reentered the car and, rising to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moderate elevation, resumed our journey at a rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace. The pathless frozen desert beneath us glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered occasionally in the starlight, and after a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time we caught sight of the well-remembered shafts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light rising from the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are getting into the inhabited region," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edmund. "We shall have to search a little for land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks," he added, "because, of course, my observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions are not as accurate as those of a geodetic sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vey, and I cannot locate the precise position of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juba's caverns. But I can come very close to them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I depend upon Juba himself to aid in finding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exact spot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since our arrival in the dark hemisphere I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequently studied Juba's countenance, and I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected many signs of the interest that the poor fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low experienced in finding himself once more in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own land. Still, it seemed to me that Jack was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, and that Juba would prefer to stay with us</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to remain with his people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Caverns Once More</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE passed over several groups of inhabited</seg><seg type="columnLine">caverns, but we saw no signs of life except the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light shafts issuing upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We now ran close to the surface, and kept a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp outlook. Suddenly Juba slapped his hairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands with an expression of delight, and pointed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a row of lights which he seemed to recognize.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's it," said Edmund. "I was sure he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">know when he was at home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no mistake about it. Juba had recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized his own village, so to speak, probably by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangement of the shafts. In a little while, we our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves became aware of a certain familiar aspect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landscape, and, almost without hesitation, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached the mouth of our ovm cavern. Then we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came softly down to the ground, and the door was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on," said Jack "let's give them a surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let's fire a gun in salute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Edmund made no objection, and Jack, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost entirely recovered his activity, fired the sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the sound rattled through the frozen air, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited with great curiosity, standing within a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods of the terrible altar on which I had nearly been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrificed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, two or three hairy heads appeared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cavern's mouth. Juba immediately ran toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They disappeared like frightened rabbits, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juba dashed down the steps in pursuit. We halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the top to let him soothe the fears of his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patriots. In a short time he reappeared with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen companions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently he had explained the situation, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rather surprised at the apparent indifference</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which they greeted us. We seemed much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to see them than they were to see us. I recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized several well-known faces among them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, accompanied by Ala and her attendants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we descended, escorted by Juba, who seemed to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">great pride in leading us. Arrived at the first un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derground apartment, we found a great crowd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hairy natives assembled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Juba Meets His Friends</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE women were more cordial in their greetings</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the men, and seemed especially interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Ala and her maids. I expected to see some indica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of concern over the fate of those who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in the flood, but I observed none; and I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">really know whether or not any explanation of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">absence was given by Juba.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While most of our party remained in this cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, Edmund took Ala and the majordomo on an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploration of the deeper parts of the cavern. Ala</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed the greatest interest in everything she</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw. Edmund told me that he showed her the coal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mines, the black-smith shop, and all the curiosities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was no reason for lingering there, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as Edmund had completed his circuit, pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parations were made for our departure. Then Ed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mund took Juba aside and tried, as he had said he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would, to persuade the fellow to remain with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own people. But Juba was deaf to all arguments;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at last Edmund, throwing up his hands, said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, it's no use. Juba is determined to go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us; so we'll have to take him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poor Juba!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I often think of him now. How infinitely better</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would have been for him if he had not been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">fond of the strangers who had dropped into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomy world out of the starry sky!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  CHAPTER XXII.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">At the Capital</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   NEED not detain you with an account of our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   return trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     Edmund again laid his course by the stars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and running at a high elevation we passed over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystal mountains and their warring tempests, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieving that we could recogniw with our glasses the</seg><seg type="columnLine">A COLUMBUS OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">huge jeweled peak that had once so nearly wrought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">our destruction. Edmund pointed this out to Ala, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she clung to his arm; and then we crossed the sea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where we had first met her, and were soon coursing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">under the great cloud-dome in the land of filtered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sunshine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Upon reaching the capital, the same scenes of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jubilation were renewed; but there was great sur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prise at our reappearing from exactly the opposite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">direction to that in which we had been expected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">An airplane was at once despatched to recall those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who were waiting for us on the border of the twi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">light zone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There can be no doubt that the forebodings which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had so long occupied my mind tended to color my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">judgment, yet I would have sworn that I detected</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a change in the moral atmosphere of the capital.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Our greeting from the people was hearty, as usual,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but there were faces which seemed to me to wear a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">half-concealed scowl; and I caught, occasionally, an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unfriendly glance in the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  These things impressed me so deeply that again I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">warned Edmund.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The current is beginning to run against us," I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">told him. "I am sure of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This time he did not laugh at my fears. On the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">contrary, he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, I believe you are right. But I am not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">afraid. We have weathered worse storms."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But, what will you do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Let events take their course, and watch them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Then you may be too late. Listen to me. Pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pare the car, get Ala's consent to go, for I believe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she would follow you anywhere, and start for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earth at the earliest possible moment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Edmund mused a little while; then he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The day after to-morrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The day after to-morrow?" I replied impa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tiently. "Why trifle thus?

The blow was nearer falling than I could have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suspected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was hastened without doubt, by an occurrence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which nobody could foresee or govern, and which,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if it had happened at the time of our first arrival,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would probably have had no mischievous conse-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quences for us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But, since that fatal interview in the temple, all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was changed; and an event more disastrous for us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than that which now occurred, Ingra himself could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not have devised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Opening of the Cloud Dome</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">TT was the opening of the cloud-dome!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">-*• I have already told you that at certain unpre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dictable times a rift appeared in the pearly vault of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the heavens, and the sun for a few minutes blazed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down through the opening in unclouded splendor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">So many years had elapsed since the last occurrence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of this phenomenon, that for the younger genera-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion it was only a tradition; yet it was a tradition</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">611</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on which the pagan religious system--of which the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eagle-faced sphinx in the red-lighted temple was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the head-center--was based; and its influence upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ignorant and superstitious multitude was un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bounded and irresistible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This terrible priest, whose hatred of us had of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">course, been stimulated by Ala's open defiance, had,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as I feared, occupied the time of our absence in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">poisoning as many minds as possible against us;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and his sacred character had enabled him to spread</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the venom of religious prejudice with amazing ra-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pidity. Even if we had not wasted time on our un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fortunate expedition, I do not know that we could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have done much to counteract his pernicious in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fluence; but then, at least, we should have been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ready at an earlier date to escape from his clutches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And who knows what Ala, with her great popu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tenty might have accomplished if she had been on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ground ? I did not doubt for a moment that In-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gra was in the capital, and thick in the plot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The opening of the dome came very suddenly. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was announced by a great shout--a rare occurrence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the people who happened to be on the outer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">platforms of the palace tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We were all with Ala at the time, Edmund being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">engaged in trying to decipher the curious characters</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a large book which she had brought him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Upon hearing the shout, we all ran out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The scene was one of the most unforgettable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">things that occurred in our whole expedition. Ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cited people were crowding the platforms, jostling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one another, jabbering, pushing, and pointing up-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ward; some already on their knees, others with looks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the utmost consternation, throwing their arms</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wildly above their heads, while hundreds of airplanes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were circling like frightened birds above the towers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Venerians See the Sun</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T glanced upward, following the direction of thou-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">*	sands of eyes, and was momentarily blinded by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the fierce glare of the sun, pouring its unmitigated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rays straight down through a narrow rift in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cloud-dome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The gold and jewels that decorated the tower mado</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it blaze with a splendor like that of a huge frost-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gemmed tree struck by the morning rays after a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">winter night's ice-storm.

With one long arm carrying a sort</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of crozier, he pointed aloft, while he muttered a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chant that fell like a charm upon the superstitious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">multitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I glanced at Ala.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She did not stir; and I felt my heart give an ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ultant bound, with the conviction which flashed over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me that her active, penetrating mind had flung off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the burden of this superstition. How much Edmund</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had been able to teach her, I do not know; but I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gave him all credit for the change.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Soon the terrible priest directed hi3 menacing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glance upon us, as we continued standing after ali</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the others had abjectly fallen before him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">612</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If his eyes had glared before, they turned to liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flames now. With a majestic stride, he advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Ala; and I thought for a moment that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to strike her down with his staff. Edmund</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed her behind him; and I shall never cease to</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrill at the recollection that I, with a boldness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised and gratified me afterward, sprang in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly to Edmund's side, with Jack--brave old Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my elbow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What we should have done next I do not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our enemy hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An Anathema</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHETHER he was cowered by our menacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspect, or whether he thought it unbecoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dignity to attack us physically, at any rate, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped short.

An instant later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and before I could speak to Edmund, he was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Th'is capped the climax of my apprehensions. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere fact that Ingra dared to show himself here</seg><seg type="columnLine">attested the change that had occurred in our situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

As it was, my mind was too full, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the culminating scene was stamped on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The immense palace-tower and hundreds of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">towers all over the city were decorated as we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seen them before. The display of color was</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing, even after our experience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most beautiful of all, I thought, was the spectacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented by the thousands of airplanes and airships</seg><seg type="columnLine">in gala dress. They spiraled about, so countless and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so brilliant, so swift and so graceful in their mazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">circlings, that one seemed to be plunged into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of a vast swarm of the most gorgeous butter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So dazzling and fascinating a spectacle was never</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceived by the most ingenious inventor of carni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vals and ballets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even while I stood admiring it I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive away the thought that this wonderful display</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, in itself, simply a defiance to our enemies, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving of the toreador's scarlet flag, and I shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered at consequences which I could not foresee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hour for the final ceremony was now close at</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and we were all to take a conspicuous part in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, standing with Ala and Edmund to receive the</seg><seg type="columnLine">congratulations of the people, after a priest, whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">C14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ala had won over to her side, had publicly pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed their betrothal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ala, beautiful as I had never yet seen her, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already habited in white garments glittering with</seg><seg type="columnLine">diamonds, and Edmund had been fitted out in appro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">priate dress which splendidly set off his magnificent</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure, with a jeweled fillet resting amid his dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">curls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Preparing to Return to the Earth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE we waited thus in one of the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartments of the palace-tower an irresistible</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse came to me to examine the car, which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been removed to a neighboring tower. I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know why I suddenly felt this desire--it may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been some suspicion of possible meddling by Ingra</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but, at any rate, I immediately yielded to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had a key to the chamber in which the car was</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked, and I said to Edmund, who was in high</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to run over to look at the car."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," he replied, "but you must be back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quarter of an hour, without fail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be back," I responded, and summoned an air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat waiting at the landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack and Henry at once expressed a desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompany me, and I consented. We were not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute in crossing the space separating the palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the adjoining tower, and while Jack and Henry</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained on the landing of the latter, admiring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene before them, I approached the locked chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing the car. As I put the key in the door I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked myself:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What am I here for? I'm hanged if I know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, anyhow, I'll take a look."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I opened the door and entered. The car was ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently all right, and, while I was looking it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no particular design, I heard Jack's voice raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">in great excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I ran to the door, and a gush of heat smote me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the face. A single glance showed me that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace was in flames! Vast tongues of fire were</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping up from its lower stories, licking the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerable brilliant balconies, which burst into flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if they had been so much tinder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stunned for an instant by the awful sight, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next moment I leaped into the air-boat, pushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack and Henry before me, but even as we did this</seg><seg type="columnLine">the material of the boat caught fire, and its engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang back upon the platform of the tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Quick!" I shouted. "We must get the car out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We dashed into the apartment containing it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now the value of Edmund's recent instructions was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown. But for them I should never have been able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to manage it in such an emergency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madly we pushed it out into the furnace of heat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our own tower had caught fire, ind, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang inside, I turned on the power. \ve rose like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shot out of the flame and smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately I swung round on the other side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the palace opposite to that where we had been. Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I hoped, the flames had not yet mounted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">level that they had attained on the other side. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sight met my eyes that, for a moment, drove me</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad with rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Conflagration</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE, with a single steersman in an air-boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Ingra, torch in hand, spreading the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flagration ! Forgetting in my fury what I had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, I drove the car straight against him. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with startled eyes, and saw us bearing down upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He read death in my face, and his own grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Desperately he endeavored to evade the encounter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the steel car struck his boat like a ram, crushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its side, and sent Ingra and his unfortunate com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion spinning into the flames below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I exulted over the deed! I felt an unholy joy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">having at last wrought vengeance upon this monster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the thought of the time I had lost flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me like an accusation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In Heaven's name!" I cried. "We must save</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edmund and Ala!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And Juba!" shouted Jack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I turned the car, and sped for the platform on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I knew that they must be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We saw them! But--Heaven forgive me!--w€</seg><seg type="columnLine">were too late!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My vengeance had been purchased at an awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">price. A minute earlier we might have saved them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now they were in the midst of the flames. Ed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mund had Ala in his arms, and Juba, his long hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">catching the sparks, stood resolutely beside them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Edmund saw me, and, as I live, he smiled. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his lips, but in the awful roar of the fire I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not hear his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he raised his hand, and seemed to be waving</seg><seg type="columnLine">us off. He pointed upward, as if commanding us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll save them yet!" I yelled between my set</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth, and rushed the car into the flames.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at this instant the whole vast structure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower gave way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It crumbled like a pile of ashes, and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXIV.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Earth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a few minutes after this terrible consum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation none of us spoke a word.

Jack stood motionless by my side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where the tower had been, and the leaping flames</seg><seg type="columnLine">had raged, was a vast vacuity, with wreathes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke rising from far below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conflagration was now spreading all over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid city. A hundred towers were burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercely on all sides, the pointed flames licking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, and thousands of planes and air-ships that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">also caught fire were dropping like flaming brands</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the furnace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sight filled me at once with pity and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror. I saw one large plane, filled with people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven, in spite of the exertions of its engineers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly over a burning tower. A long spire of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame reached up and touched it. It seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrivel like a moth in a candle, and down it went</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all its living freight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get away from here!" cried Jack, at last recover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned the car and we sped away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For hours we rushed on, not particular to choose</seg><seg type="columnLine">A COLUMBUS OF SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">615</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">our direction.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was necessary instantly to close the window, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air was rushing out, and in a few seconds it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be all gone, and we could not replace it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus which Edmund had provided automati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally purified the air in the car, and rendered it fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be breathed over and over again for an indefinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, but there was no means of making more air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Already in the few seconds that the window had</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained open the larger part of our supply of air</seg><seg type="columnLine">had escaped, and the moment we had slammed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window back into its air-tight settings Jack and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped and sank almost helpless on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several minutes we were unable to rise.

J. T. Maston was still to be found at Ballis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tic Cottage.

After the Columbiad</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Tampa Town there was to come the monster can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non of--of--the place of x! And already there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were people who could hear the sonorous command:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No. 1! Aim at the Moon!

There was nothing in it of a soothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendency, it must be admitted. By J. T. Maston's</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations, the problem had evidently been solved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The operation to be attempted by Barbicane &amp; Co.</seg><seg type="columnLine">would, it was only too clear, introduce a most re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grettable modification in the dkirnal movement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A new axis would be substituted for the old. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">we know what would be the consequences of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">substitution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The enterprise of Barbicane &amp; Co. was thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged, cursed, and demitted to general reprobation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barbicane &amp; Co. were dangers to society. If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">retained a few partisans in the United States, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were few indeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Interesting for the Inhabitants of the Terrestrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spheroid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FROM the point of view of their own personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety, Impey Barbicane and Captain Nicholl</seg><seg type="columnLine">had certainly done wisely to clear out. They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuredly have come to grief if they had not done</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. It was not with impunity that they could men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ace fourteen hundred millions of people, upset their</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits and customs, and disturb their very existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">by provoking a general catastrophe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But how had these two men managed to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear without leaving a trace? How could they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gotten away unperceived with the men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">material necessary for their project? Hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagons, if they went by railway, and hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships, if they went by sea, would be required for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the transport of the metal, the fuel, and the meli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">melonite. It was quite incomprehensible how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure could have taken place incognito. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken place nevertheless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inquiries were made, but nothing was discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to any order being sent to any of the metallur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gical or chemical works of the world. It was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">explicable! But the explanation would come--some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barbicane and Nicholl having mysteriously dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PURCHASE OF THE NORTH POLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, were beyond immediate danger. But 3.</seg><seg type="columnLine">T. Maston! He was under lock and key; but were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not public reprisals to be feared ? Bah! He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble himself about that in the least! Admirably</seg><seg type="columnLine">obstinate was the calculator! He was of iron--like</seg><seg type="columnLine">bis fore-arm! At nothing did he quail!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  From the depths of his cell in the jail of Baltimore</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secretary of the Gun Club became more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed in the distant contemplation of the col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues he had not accompanied. In his mind's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye he could see Barbicane and Nicholl preparing</seg><seg type="columnLine">their gigantic enterprise in that unknown region</seg><seg type="columnLine">where no one could interefere with them. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them making the cannon, mixing the meli-melonite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">casting the projectile which the Sun would soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">count among its minor asteroids! That new star</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was to bear the name of Scorbitta, as a deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate compliment to the millionaire of New Park!</seg><seg type="columnLine">J. T. Maston began to count the days that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">elapse before the word to fire was given.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the month of April. In two months and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half the Sun would halt at the solstice on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tropic of Cancer and retrograde toward the Tropic</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Capricorn. Three months later he would cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Equator at the autumnal equinox. And with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would finish the seasons that for millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages had alternated with such regularity in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrestrial year. For the last time the spheroid</seg><seg type="columnLine">would submit to the inequality of its days and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights. For the future the number of hours be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween sunrise and sunset would be equal all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In truth it was a magnificent work! J. T.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the Commission of Inquiry visited him</seg><seg type="columnLine">daily, and obtained nothing. It occurred at last to</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Prestice to make use of an influence that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might succeed better than his--that of Mrs. Scor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitt. No one was ignorant of the lengths to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the widow would go when the celebrated calculator</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in peril.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a meeting of the Commission, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Scorbitt was authorized to visit the prisoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">as often as she thought fit. Was not she threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the danger from the recoil of the monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannon as much as any other of the world's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitants? Would her New Park mansion escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">the final catastrophe any more than the wigwam</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the poor Indian or the humble hut of the back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">woodsman? Was not hsr life as much in danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that of the obscurest Samoyed or South Sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islander? The president of the Commission ela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">borately explained this to her, and suggested that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she should bring her influence to bear for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">genei*al good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If she could only get J.

Let it not be supposed that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the heroic Evangelina was a slave to human weak-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ness. And if, on the 9th of April, some indiscreet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ear had been applied to the keyhole the first time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the widow appeared in the cell, this is what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would have met it:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"At last, dear Maston, I see you again!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You, Mrs. Scorbitt!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, my friend, after four weeks, four long</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weeks of separation--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Exactly twenty-eight days, flve hours, forty-five</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">minutes," said Maston, looking at his watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"At last we meet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But why, Mrs. Scorbitt?

But such catastrophes</seg><seg type="columnLine">would only be partial! Thousands of people would</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappear, and the rest would hardly notice any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing worth mentioning! As the fatal day ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached, fear came over the bravest.

Owing to a passage in the Apo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">calypse, the people of Europe were persuaded that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Day of Judgement was nigh. They waited for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the signs of wrath; the son of Perdition, Antichrist,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was to be revealed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "In the last year of the tenth century," relates</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">H.

They provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">only for their immediate needs; they handed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lands and castles to the monasteries to obtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">their protection in the kingdom in the skies which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to come to them. Many of the deeds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gift to the churches begin with the words, 'The</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the world approaching, and its ruin being</seg><seg type="columnLine">imminent.' When the end of the fetal terra arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people kept within the basilicas, the chapels, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edifices consecrated to God, and waited in agony</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the seven trumpets of the seven angels of</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment to sound in the sky."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As we know, New Year's Day, 1000, was reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">without any disturbance in the laws of Nature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this time the expectation of the catastrophe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not based on a doubtful interpretation of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">text.

This time it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not the sea that would give back the dead, but the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sea that would engulf millions of the living.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Under these circumstances, the position of J.

Mrs. Scorbitt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trembled lest he should become the victim of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">general mania. Sometimes she thought of advising</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him to speak the word which he so obstinately kept</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to himself. But she dared not, and she did well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It would have been to expose herself to a categorical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">refusal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The city of Baltimore was a prey to terror, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it became difficult to restrain the populace, who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were being excited even unto madness by the news-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">papers, by the telegrams which they published from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the four angles of the earth, to use the apocalyptic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">language of St. John the Evangelist in the days of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Domitian.

Our knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is due chiefly to Thomson, Johnston, Count</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tekeli and Doctor Meyer. It is a mountainous dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trict under the sovereignty of the Sultan Bali-Bali,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose people are negroes, and number from thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forty thousand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three degrees south of the Equator rises the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chain of Kilimanjaro, which lifts its highest sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit over 18,000 feet above the sea, and commands</seg><seg type="columnLine">northward, southward, and westward, the vast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fertile plains of the Wamasai.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A few miles below the first slopes of the mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">lies the town of Kisongo, where the Sultan resides.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The capital is, truth to tell, but a large village. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is occupied by a population, highly gifted and intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligent, and working hard as much by itself as by</seg><seg type="columnLine">its slaves under the iron yoke of Bali-Bali, who is</seg><seg type="columnLine">justly considered to be one of the most remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">sovereigns of Central Africa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Impey Barbicane and Captain Nicholl, accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied by ten foremen devoted to the enterprise, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at Kisongo in the first week of January.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fact of their departure had only been communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated to J.

They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">embarked at New York for the Cape of Good Hope;</seg><seg type="columnLine">thence they had gone to Zanzibar; and a bark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretly chartered, had taken them to Mombasa on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other side of the channel. An escort from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sultan had met them at this port, and after a diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult journey of about 300 miles across this harassed</seg><seg type="columnLine">region, obstructed by forests, cut up by streams,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and checkered with marshes, they had reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">royal residence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as he had obtained J.

The Sultan had become one of the warmest</seg><seg type="columnLine">admirers of the audacious Yankee after the cele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brated Moon Voyage, the fame of which had spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to this distant country. Without disclosing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his object Barbicane had obtained from the Wama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sai the needful authority to open important works</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the southern base of Kilimanjaro. For the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable sum of three hundred thousand dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars Bali-Bali had engaged to furnish him with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor he required to do what he liked with Kiliman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaro. He could take it down if he liked, or carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">it away if he could; and he became as much the</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner of the mountain as he was of the North</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Works in Africa</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BARBICANE and his colleague were cordially</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcomed at Kisongo. Bali-Bali felt an ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miration bordering on adoration for the two illus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trious voyagers who had launched out in space to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attain the circumlunar regions, and sympathized</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiastically with the projectors of the myste-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rious works they wished to establish in his kingdom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He undertook that the enterprise should be kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret, both by himself and his subjects, for all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he could answer, as not one of the negroes</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged had the right to leave the works for a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">under penalty of the most dreadful punishments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On this account the operation was enveloped in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery that the cleverest detectives of America</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Europe failed to penetrate, and if it was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered at last it was because the Sultan had relaxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his severity after the completion of the works, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">because there are traitors or chatterers even among</seg><seg type="columnLine">negroes. It was in this way that Richard W. Trust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the consul at Zanzibar, got wind of what was hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pening at Kilimanjaro. But at that date, the 13th</seg><seg type="columnLine">of September, it was too late to stop Barbicane in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the accomplishment of his plans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reason that Barbicane &amp; Co. had chosen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country of the Wamasai as the scene of their opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions was that, in the first place, it was little known</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rarely visited by travelers, and, secondly, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mass of Kilimanjaro offered all the qualities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">solidity and position necessary for their work. Be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, the country was rich in all the materials they</seg><seg type="columnLine">required, and these were found under conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made them easily workable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few months before leaving the United States,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barbicane had learned from the Swedish explorer</seg><seg type="columnLine">630</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that iron and coal were abundant in the Kiliman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaro chain. There were no mines to be opened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no shafts to be driven thousands of feet into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crust of the earth. The minerals were on the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, and had only to be picked up from the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in addition to these, there were large deposits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nitrate of soda and iron pyrites, such as were</seg><seg type="columnLine">required for the manufacture of the meli-melonite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barbicane and Nicholl had brought no staff of</seg><seg type="columnLine">workmen with them except the ten foremen, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom they could depend. These could take com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand of the ten thousand negroes placed at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposal by Bali-Bali, to whom was entrusted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">task of making the monster cannon and its no less</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster projectile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fortnight after the arrival of Barbicane and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his colleague among the Wamasai, three large work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shops had been erected in the south of the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain; one as the foundry for the gun, one as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foundry for the shot, and one as the factory for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meli-melonite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And how did Barbicane &amp; Co. intend to cast a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannon of such colossal dimensions? The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance for the inhabitants of the world was, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen, in the difficulty of dealing with such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge undertaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To cast a cannon a million times larger than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hundred pounder would have been beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of man. To make a four hundred pounder</seg><seg type="columnLine">is difficult enough, but a four hundred million</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounder! Barbicane &amp; Co. did not attempt to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. It was not a cannon nor even a mortar, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had in their minds. They simply intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive a gallery into the mountain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently this enormous mine would have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eame effect as a gigantic Columbiad, the manu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">facture of which would have been as oostly as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was difficult, owing to the thickness it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be to avoid the risk of bursting. Barbicane &amp;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Co. had always intended to act in this way, and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">J. T. Maston's note-book spoke of a cannon, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four hundred pounder he had taken as the basis</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his calculations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Consequently, a spot was chosen a hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the southern side of the chain, from the base of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the plains extended for miles and miles, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nothing would be in the way of the projectile</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it was hurled from the long tube in the mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Kilimanjaro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With great precision and much labor Barbicane</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried on the driving of his tunnel. Easy to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the construction of boring machines worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with air compressed by the power of the large</seg><seg type="columnLine">waterfalls in the district. The holes bored by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines were charged with meli-melonite, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasting of the rock was easy, it being a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">syenite composed of orthoclasic felspar and amphi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolic hornblende. It was a favorable circumstance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a rock so constituted would strongly resist the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightful pressure developed by the expansion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gas; but the height and thickness of the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain afforded ample security against any exterior</seg><seg type="columnLine">splitting or cracking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Great Gun Is Finished</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE thousands of workmen under the guidance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ten foremen, superintended by Barbi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cane, progressed with such zeal and intelligence that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in less than six months the tunnel was finished. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">measured nearly ninety feet in diameter and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet long. As it was important that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectile should glide along a perfectly smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface without losing any of the gas deflagration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior was lined with a smooth tube of cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron. This was a much larger affair than the cele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brated Columbiad of Tampa Town, which had sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aluminum projectile around the Moon. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is there that is impossible to the engineers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the modern world?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the boring went on in the flank of Kiliman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaro, the workmen were busy at the second foundry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While the tube was being built the enormous pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectile was in process of manufacture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All it consisted of was a mass of cast-iron, cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">droconical in form, weighing one hundred and eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand tons. It had never been intended to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a casting in one piece, but to provide one hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and eighty masses, each of one thousand tons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which could be hoisted into the tube and arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of the meli-melonite so as to form a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pact charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It thus became necessary to furnish the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">foundry with four hundred thousand tons of ore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy thousand tons of flux, and four hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand tons of good coal, which at the outset was</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformed into two hundred and eighty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons of coke. As the deposits were all in the vicinity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was only a matter of transport.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The greatest difficulty was the construction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast furnaces for dealing with the ore; but never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless, before a month was out ten furnaces were</seg><seg type="columnLine">at work, capable, each, of an output of one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eighty tons a day. This gave eighteen hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred tons in the twenty-four hours, and a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eighty thousand tons in ten working days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meli-melonite factory the work went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily, and so secretly that the composition of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive was never discovered. All went well; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was hardly an accident to mar the progress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Sultan was delighted. He followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations with indefatigable assiduity, and it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be imagined how his Majesty's presence stimulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the zeal of his faithful subjects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he asked what it all meant, Barbicane</seg><seg type="columnLine">would reply engimatically:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a work which will change the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A work," Captain Nicholl would add, "that will</seg><seg type="columnLine">confer on the Sultan Bali-Bali a glory that will</seg><seg type="columnLine">never fade among the monarchs of Eastern Africa!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that the Sultan of the Wamasai felt proud</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no need for us to insist!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Great Projectile</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON the 29th of August the works were completed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tunnel was lined with the smooth iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube built up within it. At the end lay stored two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand tons of meli-melonite in communication</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the box of fulminate. Then came the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectile three hundred and forty-five feet long. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the projectile was a space of fourteen hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and fifty feet in which effect would be given</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the impulse due to the expansion of the gas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That being the case, there remained the question</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a question of pure "ballistics--would the projectile</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the trajectory assigned to it by J.

No, for when it left the tube plunged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness of the earth, it could not be seen, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides owing to its moderate height it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very considerable angular velocity. Once it</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the zone of light, the smallness of its volume</seg><seg type="columnLine">would conceal it from the most powerful glasses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for a stronger reason it would, when free from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the influence of terrestrial attraction, gravitate for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever around the Sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Assuredly Barbicane &amp; Co. might be proud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work they were about to complete.

He gave such a strange account of him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self that he was supposed demented. Subsequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">he alleged that his mind was a blank from the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of his escape from the Lady Vadn. His case</seg><seg type="columnLine">was discussed among psychologists at the time as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curious instance of the lapse of memory conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent upon physical and mental stress. The fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing narrative was found among his papers by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">undersigned, his nephew and heir, but unaccom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied by any definite request for publication.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only island known to exist in the region in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which my ucle was picked up is Noble's Isle, a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">volcanic islet and uninhabited.

A youngish man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaxen hair, a bristly straw-coloured mous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tache, and a dropping nether lip, was sitting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding my wrist. For a minute we stared at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other without speaking. He had watery grey eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oddly void of expression. Then just overhead came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sound like an iron bedstead being knocked about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the low angry growling of some large animal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the same time the man spoke. He repeated his</seg><seg type="columnLine">question,--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you feel now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think I said I felt all right.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">name on the boat was the *Lady Vain/ and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were spots of blood on the gunwale."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the same time my eye caught my hand, thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that it looked like a dirty skin-purse full of loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones, and all the business of the boat came back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have some of this," said he, and gave me a dose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some scarlet stuff, iced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It tasted like blood, and made me feel stronger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You were in luck," said he, "to get picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a ship with a medical man aboard." He spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a slobbering articulation, with the ghost of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lisp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What ship is this?" I said slowly, hoarse from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my long silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a little trader from Arica and Callao. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never asked where she came from in the beginning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">--out of the land of born fools, I guess.

You've been insensible for nearly thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought slowly. (I was distracted now by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelping of a number of dogs.) "Am I eligible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid food?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks to me," he said. "Even now the mutton</seg><seg type="columnLine">is boiling."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Yes," I said with assurance; "I could eat some</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutton."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," said he with a momentary hesitation, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know I'm dying to hear of how you came to be alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that boat. Damn that howling!" I thought I</seg><seg type="columnLine">detected a certain suspicion in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He suddenly left the cabin, and I heard him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">violent controversy with some one, who seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to talk gibberish in response to him.

MOREAU	639</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ter sounded as though it ended in blows, but in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 thought my ears were mistaken. Then he shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the dogs, and returned to the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well? said he in the doorway. "You were just</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to tell me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him my name, Edward Prendick, and how I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken to Natural History as a relief from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dullness of my confortable independence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed interested in this. "I've done some</seg><seg type="columnLine">science myself.

It's ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago. But go on! go on! tell me about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was evidently satisfied with the frankness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my story, which I told in concise sentences enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I felt horribly weak; and when it was finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reverted at once to the topic of Natural History</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his own biological studies. He began to ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion me closely about Tottenham Court Road and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gower Street. "Is Caplatzi still flourishing ? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shop that was!" He had evidently been a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary medical student, and drifted incontinently</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the topic of the music halls. He told me some</seg><seg type="columnLine">anecdotes. "Left it all," he said, "ten years ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How jolly it all used to be! But I made a young ass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of myself,--played myself out before I was twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. I daresay it's all different now. But I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">look up that ass of a cook, and see what he's done</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your mutton."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The growling overhead was renewed, so suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with so much savage anger that it startled, me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's that?" I called after him, but the door had</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed. He came back again with the boiled mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, and I was so excited by the appetising smell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it that I forgot the noise of the beast that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a day of alternate sleep and feeding I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far recovered as to be able to get from my bunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the scuttle, and see the green seas trying to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace with us. I judged the schooner was running</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the wind. Montgomery--that was the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flaxen-haired man--came in again as I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, and I asked him for some clothes. He lent me</seg><seg type="columnLine">some duck things of his own, for those I had worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the boat had been thrown overboard. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather loose for me, for he was large and long in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his limbs. He told me casually that the captain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-parts drunk in his own cabin. As I assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clothes, I "began asking him some questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the destination of the ship. He said the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bound to Hawaii, but that it had to land him</seg><seg type="columnLine">first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where?" said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's an island, where I live.

He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing on the ladder with his back to us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peering over the combing of the hatchway. He was, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could see, a mishapen man, short, broad and clumsy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a crooked back, a hairy neck, and a head sunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">between his shoulders. He was dressed in dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue serge, and had peculiarly thick, coarse, black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. I heard the unseen dogs growl furiously, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forthwith he ducked back,--coming into contact</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the hand I put out to fend him off from</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. He turned with animal swiftness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In some indefinable way the black face thus flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me shocked me profoundly. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">singularly deformed one. The facial part projected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming something dimly suggestive of a muzzle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the huge half-open mouth showed as big white</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth as I had ever seen in a human mouth. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were bloodshot at the edges, with scarcely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rim of white round the hazel pupils. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious glow of excitement in his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound you!" said Montgomery. "Why the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil don't you get out of the way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black-faced man started aside without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word. I went on up the companion, staring at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctively as I did so. Montgomery stayed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foot for a moment. "You have no business</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, you know," he said in a deliberate tone. "Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">place is forward."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black-faced man cowered. "They--won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have me forward." He spoke slowly, with a queer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse quality in his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Won't have you forward!" said Montgomery, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a menacing voice. "But I tell you to go!" He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the brink of saying something further, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up at me suddenly and followed me up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had paused half way through the hatchway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking back, still astonished beyond measure at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grotesque ugliness of this black-faced creature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had never beheld such a repulsive and extraordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary face before, and yet--if the contradiction is</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible--I experienced at the same time an odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling that in some way I had already encountered</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly the features and gestures that now amazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Afterwards it occurred to me that probably I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen him as I was lifted aboard; and yet that</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely satisfied my suspicion of a previous ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaintance. Yet how one could have set eyes on so</seg><seg type="columnLine">singular a face and yet have forgotten the precise</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion, passed my imagination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Montgomery's movement to follow me released my</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention, and I turned and looked about me at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flush deck of the little schooner. I was already half</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared by the sounds I had heard for what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw. Certainly I never beheld a deck so dirty. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was littered with scraps of carrot, shreds of green</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff, and indescribable filth. Fastened by chains</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mainmast were a number of grisly stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hounds, who now began leaping and barking at me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by the mizzen a huge puma was cramped in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little iron cage far too small even to give it turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing room. Farther under the starboard bulwark</seg><seg type="columnLine">were some big hutches containing a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbits, and a solitary llama was squeezed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere box of a cage forward. The dogs were muz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled by leather straps. The only human being on</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck was a gaunt and silent sailor at the wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The patched and dirty lower sails were tense in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind, and up aloft the little ship seemed carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing every sail she had. The sky was clear, the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">midway down the western sky; long waves, capped</seg><seg type="columnLine">640</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by the breeze with froth, were running with us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We went past the steersman to the taffrail, and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water come foaming under the stern and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubbles go dancing and vanishing in her wake. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and surveyed the unsavoury length of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is this an ocean menagerie?" said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks like it," said Montgomery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are these beasts for? Merchandise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curios? Does the captain think he is going to sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them somewhere in the South Seas?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It looks like it, doesn't it?" said Montgomery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned towards the wake again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly we heard a yelp and a volley of furious</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasphemy from the companion hatchway, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deformed man with the black face came up hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly. He was immediately followed by a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-haired man in a white cap. At the sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">former the staghounds, who had all tired of barking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me by this time, became furiously excited, howl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and leaping against their chains. The black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated before them, and this gave the red-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">man time to come up with him and deliver a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous blow between the shoulder-blades. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor devil went down like a felled ox, and rolled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dirt among the furiously excited dogs. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky for him that they were muzzled. The red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired man gave a yawp of exultation and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggering, and as it seemed to me in serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger of either going backwards down the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion hatchway or forward upon his victim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So soon as the second man had appeared, Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery had started forward. "Steady on there!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried, in a tone of remonstrance. A couple of sail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ors appeared on the forecastle. The black-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, howling in a singular voice, rolled about under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feet of the dogs. No one attempted to help him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The brutes did their best to worry him, butting their</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzles at him. There was a quick dance of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lithe grey-figured bodies, over the clumsy prostrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure. The sailors forward shouted, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was admirable sport. Montgomery g&amp;ve an</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry exclamation, and went striding down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck, and I followed him. The black-faced man</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled up and staggered forward, going and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaning over the bulwark by the main shrouds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he remained, panting and glaring over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder at the dogs. The red-haired man laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a satisfied laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here, Captain," said Montgomery, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bis lisp a little accentuated, gripping the elbows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the red-haired man, "this won't do!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stood behind Montgomery. The captain came</seg><seg type="columnLine">half round, and regarded him with the dull and</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemn eyes of a drunken man. "Wha' won't do?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, and added, after looking sleepily into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery's face for a minute, "Blasted Saw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a sudden movement he shook his arm free,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after two ineffectual attempts stuck his freckled</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists into his side pockets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That man's a passenger," said Montgomery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'd advise you to keep your hands off him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go to hell!" said the eaptain, loudly. He sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly turned and staggered towards the side. "Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I like on my own ship," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think Montgomery might have left him then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing the brute was drunk; but he only turned a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shade paler, and followed the captain to the bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look you here, Captain," he said; "that man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine is not to be ill-treated. He has been hazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever since he came aboard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a minute, alcoholic fumes kept the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">speechless. "Blasted Sawbones!" was all he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could see that Montgomery had one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow, pertinacious tempers that will warm day</seg><seg type="columnLine">after day to a white heat, and never again cool to</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgiveness; and I saw too that this quarrel had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been some time growing. "The man's drunk," said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I,	perhaps officiously; "you'll do no good."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery gave an ugly twist to his dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">lip. "He's always drunk. Do you think that ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuses his assaulting his passengers?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My ship," began the captain, waving his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsteadily towards the cages, "was a clean ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look at it now!" It was certainly anything but</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean. "Crew," continued the captain, "clean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">respectable crew."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You agreed to take the beasts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish I'd never set eyes on your infernal island.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What the devil--want beasts for on an island like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that? Then, that man of yours--understood he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man. He's a lunatic; and he hadn't no business</seg><seg type="columnLine">aft. Do you think the whole damned ship belongs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Tour sailors began to haze the poor devil as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as he came aboard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's just what he is--he's a devil! an ugly*</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil! My men can't stand him. I can't stand him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None of us can's stand him. Nor you either!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery turned away. "You leave that man</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, anyhow," he said, nodding his head as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the captain meant to quarrel now. He raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice. "If he comes this end of the ship again</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll cut his insides out, I tell you. Cut out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasted insides! Who are you, to tell me what I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do? I tell you I'm captain of this ship,--captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and owner. I'm the law here, I tell you,--the law</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the prophets. I bargained to take a man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attendant to and from Arica, and bring back</seg><seg type="columnLine">some animals.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the latter take a step forward, and interposed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's drunk," said I. The captain began some</seg><seg type="columnLine">abuse even fouler that the last. "Shut up!" I said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning on him sharply, for I had seen danger in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery's white face. With that I brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">downpour on myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, I was glad to avert what was uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monly near a scuffle, even at the price of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain's drunken ill-will. I do not think I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever heard quite so much vile language come in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">continuous stream from any man's Kps before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I have frequented eccentric company enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found some of it hard to endure, though I am a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mild-tempered man; but, certainly, when I told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain to "shut up" I had forgotten that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely a bit of human flotsam, cut off from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">resources and with my fare unpaid; a mere casual</seg><seg type="columnLine">dependant on the bounty, or speculative enterprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ship. He reminded me of it with consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able vigour; but at any rate I prevented a fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISLAND OF DR.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate practically assumed the command. He was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaunt, taciturn individual we had seen at the wheel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently he was in an evil temper with Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery. He took not the slightest notice of either</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us. We dined with him in a sulky silence, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few ineffectual efforts on my part to talk. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck me too that the men regarded my companion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his animals in a singularly unfriendly man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. I found Montgomery very reticent about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose with these creatures, and about his des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tination; and though I was sensible of a growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity as to both, I did not press him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We remained talking on the quarter deck until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky was thick with stars. Except for an occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional sound in the yellow-lit forecastle and a move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the animals now and then, the night was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very still. The puma lay crouched together, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing us with shining eyes, a black heap in the corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its cage. Montgomery produced some cigars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He talked to me of London in a tone of half-painful</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminiscence, asking all kinds of questions about</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes that had taken place. He spoke like a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had loved his life there, and had been suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and irrevocably cut off from it. I gossiped as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I could of this and that. All the time the strange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of him was shaping itself in my mind; and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I talked I pgered at his odd, pallid face in the dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the binnacle lantern behind me. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked out at the darkling sea, where in the dim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness his little island was hidden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This man, it seemed to me, had come out of Im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mensity merely to save my life. To-morrow he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would drop over the side, and vanish again out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my existence. Even had it been under common-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place circumstances, it would have made me a trifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtful; but in the first place was the singularity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an educated man living on this unknown little</seg><seg type="columnLine">island, and coupled with that the extraordinary na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of his luggage. I found myself repeating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain's question, What did he want with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts? Why, too, had he pretended they were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">his when I had remarked about them at first? Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, in his personal attendant there was a bizarre</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality which had impressed me profoundly. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances threw a haze of mystery round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. They laid hold of my imagination, and ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered my tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Towards midnight our talk of London died away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we stood side by side leaning over the bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warks and staring dreamily over the silent, starlit</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea, each pursuing his own thoughts. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere for sentiment, and I began upon my</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I may say it," said I, after a time, "you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved my life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chance," he answered. "Just chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I prefer to make my thanks to the accessible</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank no one. You had the need, and I had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge; and I injected and fed you much as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have collected a specimen. I was bored, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted something to do. If I'd been jaded that day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or hadn't liked your face, well--it's a curious ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion where you would have been now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This damped my mood a little. "At any rate," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It's a chance, I tell you," he interrupted,--"as</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything is in a man's life. Only the asses won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see it! ^ Why am I here now, an outcast from civili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation, instead of being a happy man enjoying all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasures of London? Simply because eleven years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago--I lost my head for ten minutes on a foggy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped. "Yes?" said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We relapsed into silence. Presently he laughed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's something in this starlight that loosens</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's tongue. I'm an gss, and yet somehow I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to tell you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '"Whatever you tell me, you may rely upon my</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping to myself--if that's it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was on the point of beginning, and then shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, doubtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Don't," said I. "It is all the same to me. After*</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, it is better to keep your secret. There's noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gained but a little relief if I respect your con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence. If I don't--well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grunted undecidedly. I felt I had him at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disadvantage, had caught him in the mood of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">discretion; and to tell the truth I was not curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn what might have driven a young medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">student out of London. I have an imagination. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged my shoulders and turned away. Over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">taffrail leant a silent black figure, watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars. It was Montgomery's strange attendant. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked over its shoulder quickly with my movement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then looked away again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It may seem a little thing to you, perhaps, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came like a sudden blow to me. The only light</seg><seg type="columnLine">near us was a lantern at the wheel. The creature's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was turned for one brief instant out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimness of the stern towards this illumination, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that the eyes that glanced at me shone with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale-green light. I did not know then that a red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dish luminosity, at least, is not uncommon in hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man^ eyes. The thing came to me as stark inhu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manity. That black figure with its eyes of fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck down through all my adult thoughts and feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, and for a moment the forgotten horrors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">childhood came back to ray mind. Then the effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed as it had come. An uncouth black figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man, a figure of no particular import, hung over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the taffrail against the starlight, and I found Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery was speaking to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'm thinking of turning in, then," said he, "if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've had enough of this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I answered him incongruously. We went below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he wished me good-night at the door of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night I had some very unpleasant dreams.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The waning moon rose late. Its light struck a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghostly white beam across my cabin, and made an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ominous shape on the planking by my bunk. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">642</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the staghounds woke, and began howling and bay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; so that I dreamt fitfully, and scarcely slept until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approach of dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Man Who Had Nowhere to Go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the early morning (it was the second morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing after my recovery, and I believe the fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">after I was picked up), I awoke through an</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenue of tumultuous dreams,--dreams of guns and</seg><seg type="columnLine">howling mobs,--and became sensible of a hoarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting above me. I rubbed my eyes and lay lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tening to the noise, doubtful for a little while of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereabouts. Then came a sudden pattering of bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, the sound of heavy objects being thrown about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a violent creaking and the rattling of chains. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the swish of the water as the ship was sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly brought round, and a foamy yellow-green</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave flew across the little round window and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">it streaming. I jumped into my clothes and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As I came up the ladder I saw against the flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky--for the sun was just rising--the broad back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and red hair of the captain, and over his shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">the puma spinning from a tackle rigged on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mizzen spanker-boom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The poor brute seemed horribly scared, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched in the bottom of its little cage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Overboard with 'em!" bawled the captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ovei'board with 'em! We'll have a clean ship soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the whole bilin' of 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood in my way, so that I had perforce to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tap his shoulder to come on deck. He came round</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a start, and staggered back a few paces to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stare at me. It needed no expert eye to tell that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man was still drunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hullo!" said he, stupidly; and then with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light coming into his eyes, "Why, it's Mister--?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mister?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Prendick," said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Prendick be damned!" said he. "Shut-up,^</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's your name. Mister Shut-up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was no good answering the brute; but I cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly did not expect his next move. He held out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand to the gangway by which Montgomery</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood talking to a massive grey-haired man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty-blue flannels, who had apparently just come</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That way, Mister Blasted Shut-up! that way!'</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Montgomery and his companion turned as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?" I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That way, Mister Blasted Shut-up,--that's what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I mean! Overboard, Mister Shut-up,--and sharp!</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're cleaning the ship out,--cleaning the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">blessed ship out; and overboard you go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I stared at him dumbfounded. Then it occurred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that it was exactly the thing I wanted. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost prospect of a journey as sole passenger with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this quarrelsome sot was not one to mourn over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I turned towards Montgomery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't have you," said Montgomery's companion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">concisely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can't have me!" said I, aghast. He had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">squarest and most resolute face I ever set eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here," I began, turning to the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Overboard!" said the captain. "This ship aint</seg><seg type="columnLine">for beasts and cannibals and worse than beasts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more. Overboard you go, Mister Shut-up. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">they can't have you, you goes overboard. But, any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, you go--with your friends. I've done with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this blessed island for evermore, amen! I've had</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Montgomery," I appealed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He distorted his lower lip, and nodded his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopelessly at the grey-haired man beside him, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicate his powerlessness to help me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll see to you, presently," said the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then began a curious three-cornered altercation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alternately I appealed to one and another of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men,--first to the grey-haired man to let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, and then to the drunken captain to keep me</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard. I even bawled entreaties to the sailors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery said never a word, only shook his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're going overboard, I tell you," was the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain's refrain. "Law be damned! I'm king here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last I must confess my voice suddenly broke in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of a vigorous threat. I felt a gust of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysterica! petulance, and went aft and stared dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mally at nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the sailors progressed rapidly with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">task of unshipping the packages and caged animals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A large launch, with two standing lugs, lay under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lea of the schooner; and into this the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">assortment of goods were swung. I did not then</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the hands from the island that were receiving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the packages, for the hull of the launch was hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den from me by the side of the schooner. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery nor his companion took the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice of me, but busied themselves in assisting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">directing the four or five sailors who were unload-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the goods. The captain went forward interfer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rather than assisting. I was alternately</seg><seg type="columnLine">despairful and desperate. Once or twice as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood waiting there for things to accomplish them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, I could not resist an impulse to laugh at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">miserable quandry. I felt all the wretcheder for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of a breakfast. Hunger and a lack of blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpuscles take all the manhood from a man. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived pretty clearly that I had not the stamina</seg><seg type="columnLine">either to resist what the captain chose to do to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pel me, or to force myself upon Montgomery and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion. So I waited passively upon fate; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work of transferring Montgomery's possessions</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the launch went on as if I did not exist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently that work was finished, and then came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a struggle. I was hauled, resisting weakly enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the gangway. Even then I noticed the oddness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the brown faces of the men who were with Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery in the launch; but the launch was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully laden, and was shoved off hastily. A broaden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gap of green water appeared under me, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed back with all my strength to avoid falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlong. The hands in the launch shouted deris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ively, and I heard Montgomery curse at them; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the captain, the mate, and one of the seamen</seg><seg type="columnLine">helping him, ran me aft towards the stern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dingey of the "Lady Vain" had been towing</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind; it was half full of water, had no oars, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite unvictualled. I refused to go aboard her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flung myself full length on the deck. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, they swung me into her by a rope (for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no stern ladder), and then they cut me adrift.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU	643</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I drifted slowly from the schooner. In a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupor I watched all hands take to the rigging, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly but surely she came round to the wind; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sails fluttered, and then bellied out as the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into them. I stared at her weather-beaten side</seg><seg type="columnLine">heeling steeply towards me; and then she passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of my range of view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I did not turn my head to follow her. At first I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could scarcely believe what had happened. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crouched in the bottom of the dingey, stunned, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">staring blankly at the vacant, oily sea. Then I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">realized that I was in that little hell of mine again,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">now half swamped; and looking back over the gun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wale, I saw the schooner standing away from me,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the red-haired captain mocking at me over the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taffrail, and turning towards the island saw the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">launch growing smaller as she aproached the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Abruptly the cruelty of this desertion became clear'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to me. I had no means of reaching the land unless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I should chance to drift there. I was still weak,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you must remember, from my exposure in the boat;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I was empty and very faint, or I should have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">more heart. But as it was I suddenly began to sob</seg><seg type="columnLine">and weep, as I had never done since I was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">child. The tears ran down my face' In a passion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of despair I struck with my fists at the water in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the boat, and kicked savagely at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunwale. I prayed aloud for God to let me die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Evil-Looking Boatmen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT the islanders, seeing that I was really</seg><seg type="columnLine">adrift, took pity on me. I drifted very slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the eastward, approaching the island slant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly; and presently I saw, with hysterical relief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the launch come round and return towards me. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heavily laden, and I could make out as she drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer Montgomery's white-haired, broad-shouldered</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion sitting cramped up with the dogs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">several packing-cases in the stern sheets. This in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual stared fixedly at me without moving or</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking. The black-faced cripple was glaring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as fixedly in the bows near the puma. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were three other men besides,--three strange brut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish-looking fellows, at whom the staghounds were</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarling savagely. Montgomery, who was steering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the boat by me, and rising, caught and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened my painter to the tiller to tow me, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no room aboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I had recovered from my hysterical phase by this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time, and answered his hail, as he approached,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bravely enough. I told him the dingey was nearly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swamped, and he reached me a piggin. I was jerked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back as the rope tightened between the boats. For</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some time I was busy baling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not until I had got the water under (for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water in the dingey had been shipped; the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">was perfectly sound) that I had leisure to look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people in the launch again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The white-haired man I found was still regarding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me steadfastly, but with an expression as I now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fancied, of some perplexity. When my eyes met</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his, he looked down at the staghound that sat be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tween his knees. He was a powerfully-built man,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as I have said, with a fine forehead and rather heavy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">features; but his eyes had that odd drooping of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the skin above the lids which often comes with</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing years, and the fall of his heavy mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the corners gave him an expression of pugnacious</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolution. He talked to Montgomery in a tone too</seg><seg type="columnLine">low for me to hear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  From him my eyes travelled to his three men;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a strange crew they were. I saw only their</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces, yet there was something in their faces -- I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew not what--that gave me a queer spasm "of</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgust. I looked steadily at them, and the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression did not pass, though I failed to see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had occasioned it. They seemed to me then to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown men; but their limbs were oddly swathed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">3ome thin, dirty, white stuff down even to the fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers and feet: I have never seen men so wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">up before, and women so only in the East. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore turbans too, and thereunder peered out their</seg><seg type="columnLine">elfin faces at me,--faces with protruding lower-jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bright eyes. They had lank black hair, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">like horsehair, and seemed as they sat to exceed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in stature any race of men I have seen. The white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired man, who I knew was a good six feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">height, sat a head below any one of the three. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found afterwards that really none were taller than</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself; but their bodies were abnormally long, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thigh-part of the leg short and curiously twisted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At any rate, they were an amazingly ugly gang, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the heads of them under the forward lug peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black face of the man whose eyes were luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dark. As I stared at them, they met my gaze;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then first one and then another turned away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my direct stare, and looked at me in an odd.</seg><seg type="columnLine">furtive manner. It occurred to me that I was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps annoying them, and I turned my attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island we were approaching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was low, and covered with thick vegetation,--?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chiefly a kind of palm, that was new to me. From</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one point a thin white thread of vapour rose slant-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ingly to an immense height, and then frayed out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like a down feather. We were now within the em-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brace of a broad bay flanked on either hand by a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">low promontory. The beach was of dull-grey sand,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and sloped steeply up to a ridge, perhaps sixty or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seventy feet above the sea-level, and irregularly set</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with trees and undergrowth. Half way up was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">square enclosure of some greyish stone, which I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">found subsequently was built partly of coral and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">partly of pumiceous lava. Two thatched roofs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">peeped from within this enclosure. A man stood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">awaiting us at the water's edge. I fancied while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we were still far off that I saw some other and very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grotesque-looking creatures scuttle into the bushes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon the slope; but I saw nothing of these as we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drew nearer. This man was of a moderate size, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a black negroid face. He had a large, almost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lipless, mouth, extraordinary lank arms, long thin</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feet, and bow-legs, and stood with his heavy face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thrust forward staring at us. He was dressed like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery and his white-haired companion, in jac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ket and trousers of blue serge. As we came still</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nearer, this individual began to run to and fro on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the beach, making the most grotesque movements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At a word of command from Montgomery, the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in the launch sprang up, and with singularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">awkward gestures struck the lugs. Montgomery</seg><seg type="columnLine">steered us round and into a narrow little dock ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavated in the beach. Then the man on the beach</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastened towards us. This dock, as I call it, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">644	AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">really a mere ditch just long enough at this phase of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tide to take the longboat. I heard the bows ground</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the sand, staved the dingey off the rudder of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the big boat with my piggin, and freeing the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">painter, landed. The three muffled men, with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clumiest movements, scrambled out upon the sand,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and forthwith set to landing the cargo, assisted by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the man on the beach. I was struck especially by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the curious movements of the legs of the three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swathed and bandaged boatmen, -- not stiff they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were, but distorted in some odd way, almost as if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they were jointed in the wrong place. The dogs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were still snarling, and strained at their chains</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">after these men, as the white-haired man landed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with them. The three big fellows spoke to one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">another in odd guttural tones, and the man who had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">waited for us on the beach began chattering to them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">excitedly--a foreign language, as I fancied--as they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">laid hands on some bales piled near the stern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Somewhere I had heard such a voice before, and I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could not think where. The white-haired man stood,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">holding in a tumult of six dogs, and bawling orders</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over their din. Montgomery, having unshipped the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rudder, landed likewise, and all set to work at un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">loading. I was too faint, what with my long fast</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the sun beating down on my bare head, to offer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any assistance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently the white-haired man seemed to recol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lect my presence, and came up to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You look," said he, "as though you had scarcely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">breakfasted." His little eyes were a brilliant "black</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">under his heavy brows. "I must apologize for that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Now you are our guest, we must make you comfort-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able,--though you are uninvited, you know." He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looked keenly into my face. "Montgomery says you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are an educated man, Mr. Prendick; says you know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">something of science. May I ask what that sig-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nifies?"	, ^ ,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I told him I had spent some years at the Royal</seg><seg type="columnLine">College of Science, and had done some researches</seg><seg type="columnLine">in biology under Huxley. He raised his eyebrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That alters the case a little, Mr. Prendick, ^he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said, with a trifle more respect in his manner. "As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it happens, we are biologists here. This is a biologi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cal station--of a sort." His eye rested on the men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in white who were busily hauling the puma, on rol-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lers, towards the walled yard. "I and Montgomery,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at least," he added. Then, "When you will be able</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to get away, I can't say. We're off the track to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">anywhere. We see a ship once in a twelve-month</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He left me abruptly, and went up the beach past</seg><seg type="columnLine">this group, and I think entered the enclosure. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other two men were with Montgomery, erecting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile of smaller packages on a low-wheeled truck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The llama was still on the launch with the rabbit</seg><seg type="columnLine">hutches; the staghounds were still lashed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thwarts. The pile of things completed, all three</seg><seg type="columnLine">men laid hold of the truck and began shoving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton-weight or so upon it after the puma. Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery left them, and coming back to me held</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'm glad," said he, "for my own part. That cap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tain was a silly ass. He'd have made things lively</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for you."	.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It was you," said I, "that saved me again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That depends. You'll find this island an infer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nally rum plaee, I promise you. I'd watch my go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings carefully, if I were you. He--" He hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated, and seemed to alter his mind about what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his lips. "I wish you'd help me with these rab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His procedure with the rabbits was singular. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">waded in with him, and helped him lug one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hutches ashore. No sooner was that done than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the door of it, and tilting the thing on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">end turned its living contents out on the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They fell in a struggling heap one on the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. He clapped his hads, and forthwith they went</seg><seg type="columnLine">off with that hopping run of theirs, fifteen or</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty of them I should think, up the beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Increase and multiply, my friends," said Mont-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gomery. "Replenish the island. Hitherto we've</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had a certain lack of meat here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As I watched them disappearing, the white-haired</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man returned with a brandy-flask and some biscuits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Something to go on with, Prendick," said he, in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">far more familiar tone than before. I made no ado,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but set to work on the biscuits at once, while the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white-haired man helped Montgomery to release</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about a score more of the rabbits. Three big</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hutches, however, went up to the house with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">puma. The brandy I did not touch, for I have been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an abstainer from my birth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Locked Door"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE reader will perhaps understand that at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first everything was so strange about me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my position was the outcome of such unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected adventures, that I had no discernment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">relative strangeness of this or that thing. I fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed the llama up the beach, and was overtaken by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery, who asked me not to enter the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure. I noticed then that the puma in its cage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the pile of packages had been placed outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance to this quadrangle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I turned and saw that the launch had now been</seg><seg type="columnLine">unloaded, run out again, and was being beached, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white-haired man was walking towards us.

His eyes grew brighter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I daresay you are," said Montgomery, in any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing but a cordial tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We can't send him over there, and we can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">spare the time to build him a new shanty; and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly can't take him into our confidence just</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'm in your hands," said I.

Nothing very dreadful, really, to a sane man;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but just now, as we don't know you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Decidedly," said I, "I should be a fool to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">offence at any want of confidence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He twisted his heavy mouth into a faint smile,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was one of those saturnine people who smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the corners of the mouth down,--and bowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his acknowledgment of my complaisance. The main</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance to the enclosure we passed; it was a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden gate, framed in iron and locked, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargo of the launch piled outside it, and at the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner we came to a small doorway I had not previously</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed. The white-haired man produced a bundle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of keys from the pocket of his greasy blue jacket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened this door, and entered. His keys, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elaborate locking-up of the place even while it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still under his eye, struck me as peculiar. I fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him, and found myself in a small apartment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly but not uncomfortably furnished, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its inner door, which was slightly ajar, opening into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a paved courtyard. This inner door Montgomery at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once closed. A hammock was slung across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker corner of the room, and a small unglazed win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow defended by an iron bar looked out towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This the white-haired man told me was to be my</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment; and the inner door, which "for fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">accidents," he said, he would lock on the other side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was my limit inward. He called my attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a convenient deck-chair before the window, and to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">array of old books,--chiefly, I found, surgical works</seg><seg type="columnLine">and editions of the Latin and Greek classics (lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guages I cannot read with any comfort), on a shelf</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the hammock. He left the room by the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, as if to avoid opening the inner one again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We usually have our meals in here," said Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery, and then, as if in doubt, went out after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other. "Moreau 1" I heard him call, and for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I do not think I noticed. Then as I handled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the books on the shelf it came up in consciousness:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where had I heard the rame of Moreau before? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down before the window, took out the biscuits</seg><seg type="columnLine">that still remained to me, and ate them with an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellent appetite. Moreau 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the window I saw one of those unac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countable men in white, lugging a packing-case along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach. Presently the window-frame hid him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I heard a key inserted and turned in the lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me. After a little while I heard through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked door the noise of the staghounds, that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">now been brought up from the beach. They were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">barking, but sniffing and growling in a curious fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion. I could hear the rapid patter of their feet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery's voice soothing them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was very much impressed by the elaborate</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrecy of these two men regarding the contents of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place, and for some time I was thinking of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of the unaccountable familiarity of the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Moreau; but so odd is the human memory that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not then recall that well-known name in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper connection. From that my thoughts went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the indefinable queerness of the deformed man on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach. I never saw such a gait, such odd mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions as he pulled at the box. I recalled that none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these men had spoken to me, though most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them I had found looking at me at one time or</seg><seg type="columnLine">another in a peculiarly furtive manner, quite un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like the frank stare of your unsophisticated savage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indeed, they had all seemed remarkably taciturn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when they did speak, endowed with very un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canny voices. What was wrong with them? Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I recalled the eyes of Montgomery's ungainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">attendant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as I was thinking of him he came in. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now dressed in white, and carried a little tray</seg><seg type="columnLine">with some coffee and boiled vegetables thereon. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hardly repress a shuddering recoil as he came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending amiably, and placed the tray before me on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table. Then astonishment paralyzed me. Under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stringy black hair I saw his ear; it jumped upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me suddenly close to my face. The man had pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears, covered with a fine brown fur!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your breakfast, sair," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stared at his face without attempting to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer him. He turned and went towards the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarding me oddly over his shoulder. I followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out with my eyes; and as I did so, by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd trick of unconscious cerebration, there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">surging into my head the phrase, "The Moreau</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hollows"--was it? "The Moreau--" Ah! It sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">my memory back ten years. "The Moreau Hoi'rors!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The phrase drifted loose in my mind for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then I saw it in red lettering on a little buff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coloured pamphlet, to read which made one shiver</seg><seg type="columnLine">and creep. Then I remembered distinctly all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. That long-forgotten pamphlet came back with</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling vividness to my mind. I had been a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad then, and Moreau was, I suppose, about fifty,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prominent and masterful physiologist, well-knowrf</seg><seg type="columnLine">in scientific circles for his extraordinary imagina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and his brutal directness in discusson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was this the same Moreau? He had published</seg><seg type="columnLine">some very astonishing facts in connection with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">transfusion of blood, and in addition was known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be doing valuable work on morbid growths. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly his career was closed. He had to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">England. A journalist obtained access to his labor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atory in the capacity of laboratory-assistant, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deliberate intention of making sensational ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posures; and by the help of a shocking accident (if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was an accident), his gruesome pamphlet became</seg><seg type="columnLine">notorious. On the day of its publication a wretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog, flayed and otherwise mutilated, escaped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreau's house. It was in the silly season, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominent editor, a cousin of the temporary labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory-assistant, appealed to the conscience of the na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. It was not the first time that conscience has</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned against the methods of research. The doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor was simply howled out of the country. It may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be that he deserved to be; but I still think that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tepid support of his fellow-investigators and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desertion by the great body of scientific workers was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shameful thing. Yet some of his experiments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the journalist's account, were wantonly cruel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He might perhaps have purchased his social peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">by abandoning his investigations; but he appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently preferred the latter, as most men would who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have once fallen under the overmastering spell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">research. He was unmarried, and had indeed noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but his own interest to consider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt convinced that this must be the same man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything pointed to it. It dawned upon me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">what end the puma and the other animals--which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had now been brought with other luggage into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure behind the house--were destined; and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">646</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">curious faint odour, the halitus of something famil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iar, an odour that had been in the background of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my consciousness hitherto, suddenly came forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the forefront of my thoughts. It was the anti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">septic odour of the dissecting-room. I heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">puma growling through the wall, and one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs yelped as though it had been struck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet surely, and especially to another scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, there was nothing so horrible in vivisection</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to account for this secrecy; and by some odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap in my thoughts the pointed ears and luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of Montgomery's attendant came back again</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me with the sharpest definition.

I glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">askance at this strange creature, and found him</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching me with his queer, restless eyes. Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery said he would lunch with me, but that'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreau was to preoccupied with some work to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Moreau!" said I. "I know that name."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The devil you do!" said he. "What an ass I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to mention it to you!

But it's no use locking the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the steed is stolen. It was that infernal stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">which led to my coming here,--that, and a foggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. I thought myself in luck at the time, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreau offered to get me off. It's queer--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Montgomery," said I, suddenly, as the outer door</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, "why has your man pointed ears?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn!" he said, over his first mouthful of food.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stared at me for a moment, and then repeated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pointed ears?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Little points to them," said I, as calmly as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, with a catch in my breath; "and a fine black</seg><seg type="columnLine">fur at the edges?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He helped himself to whiskey and water with</seg><seg type="columnLine">great deliberation. "I was under the impression--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his hair covered his ears."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw them as he stooped by me to put that</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee you sent to me on the table.

"I always thought," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said deliberately, with a certain accentuation of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flavouring of lisp, "that there was something the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter with his ears, from the way he covered them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What were they like?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was persuaded from his manner that this ignor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance was a pretense. Still, I could hardly tell the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man that I thought him a liar. "Pointed," I said;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"rather small and furry,--distinctly furry. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole man is one of the strangest beings I ever set</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sharp, hoarse cry of animal pain came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure behind us. Its depth and volume testified</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the puma. I saw Montgomery wince.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did you pick up the creature ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "San Francisco. He's an ugly brute, I admit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Half-witted, you know. Can't remember where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from. But I'm used to him, you know. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">both are. How does he strike you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's unnatural," I said. "There's something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him--don't think me fanciful, but it gives</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a nasty little sensation, a tightening of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles, when he comes near me. It's a touch--</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the diabolical, in fact."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Montgomery had stopped eating while I told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. "Rum!" he said. "7 can't see it." He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed his meal. "I had no idea of it," he said, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">masticated. "The crew of the schooner must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt it the same. Made a dead set at the poor devil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You saw the captain?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the puma howled again, this time more</seg><seg type="columnLine">painfully. Montgomery swore under his breath. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had half a mind to attack him about the men on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach. Then the poor brute within gave vent to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of short, sharp cries.	i</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your men on the beach," said I; "what race are</seg><seg type="columnLine">they?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excellent fellows, aren't they?" said he, absent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mindedly, knitting his brows as the animal yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said no more. There was another outcry worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the former. He looked at me with his dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">grey eyes, and then took some more whiskey. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to draw me into a discussion about alcohol,</seg><seg type="columnLine">professing to have saved my life with it. He seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to lay stress on the fact that I owed my life</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. I answered him distractedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently our meal came to an end; the misshapen</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster with the pointed ears cleared the remains</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and Montgomery left me alone in the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. All the time he had been in a state of ill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealed irritation at the noise of the vivisected</seg><seg type="columnLine">puma. He had spoken of his odd want of nerve, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left me to the obvious application.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found myself that the cries were singularly irri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tating, and they grew in depth and intensity as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon wore on. They were painful at first, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">their constant resurgence at last altogether upset</seg><seg type="columnLine">my balance. I flung aside a crib of Horace I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been reading, and began to clench my fists, to bite</seg><seg type="columnLine">my lips, and to pace the room. Presently I got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopping my ears with my fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The emotional appeal of those yells grew upon me</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily, grew at last to such an exquisite expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of suffering that I could stand it in that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fined room no longer. I stepped out of the door into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slumberous heat of the late afternoon, and walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing past the main entrance--locked again, I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">•--turned the corner of the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crying sounded even louder out of doors. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as if all the pain in the world had found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. Yet had I known such pain was in the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, and had it been dumb, I believe -- I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought since--I could have stood it well enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISLAND OF DR.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of the brilliant sunlight and the green fans</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trees waving in the soothing sea-breeze, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world was a confusion, blurred with drifting black</seg><seg type="columnLine">and red phantasms, until'I was out of earshot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house in the chequered wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Thing in the Forest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I STRODE through the undergrowth that clothed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ridge behind the house, scarcely heeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">whither I went; passed on through the shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a thick cluster of straight-stemmed trees beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and so presently found myself some way on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side of the ridge, and descending towards a</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamlet that ran through '*a narrow valley. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused and listened. The distance I had come, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intervening masses of thicket, deadened any</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound that might be coming from the enclosure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The air was still. Then with a rustle a rabbit</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged, and went scampering up the slope before</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I hesitated, and sat down in the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The place was a pleasant one. The rivulet was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden by the luxuriant vegetation of the banks</seg><seg type="columnLine">save at one point, where I caught a triangular patch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its glittering water. On the farther side I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a bluish haze a tangle of trees and creepers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and above these again the luminous blue of the sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here and there a splash of white or crimson marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blooming of some trailing epiphyte. I let my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes wander over this scene for a while, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to turn over in my mind again the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarities of Montgomery's man. But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too hot to think elaborately, and presently I fell into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tranquil state midway between dozing and waking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From this I was aroused, after I know not how</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, by a rustling amidst the greenery on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the stream. For a moment I could see noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but the waving summits of the ferns and reeds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then suddenly upon the bank of the stream appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something--at first I could not distinguish what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. It bowed its round head to the water, and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to drink. Then I saw it was a man, going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">all-fours like a beast. He was clothed in bluish</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloth, and was of a copper-coloured hue, with black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. It seemed that grotesque ugliness was an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">variable character of these islanders. I could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suck of the water at his lips as he drank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I leant forward to see him better, and a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lava, detached by my hand, went pattering down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slope. He looked up guiltily, and his eyes met</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine. Forthwith he scrambled to his feet, and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiping his clumsy hand across his mouth and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding me. His legs were scarcely half the length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his body. So, staring one another out of coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenance, we remained for perhaps the space of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute. Then, stopping to look back once or twice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he slunk off among the bushes to the right of me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I heard the swish of the fronds grow faint in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance and die away. Long after he had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, I remained sitting up staring in the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of his retreat. My drowsy tranquility had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was startled by a noise behind me, and turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly saw the flapping white tail of a rabbit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vanishing up the slope. I jumped to my feet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparition of this grotesque, half-bestial creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">had suddenly populated the stillness of the afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me. I looked around me rather nervously, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">regretted that I was unarmed. Then I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the man I had just seen had been clothed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish cloth, had not been naked as a savage would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been; and I tried to persuade myself from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fact that he was after all probably a peaceful</seg><seg type="columnLine">character, that the dull ferocity of his countenance</seg><seg type="columnLine">belied him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet I was greatly disturbed at the apparition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I walked to the left along the slope, turning my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head about, and peering this way and that among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the straight stems of the trees. Why should a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on all-fours and drink with his lips? Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard an animal wailing again, and taking it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the puma, I turned about and walked in a direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion diametrically opposite to the sound. This led</seg><seg type="columnLine">me down to the stream, across which I stepped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed my way up through the undergrowth be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was startled by a great patch of vivid scarlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground, and going up to it found it to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar fungus, branched and corrugated like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foliaceous lichen, but deliquescing into slime at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch; and then in the shadow of some luxuriant</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferns I came upon an unpleasant thing,--the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of a rabbit covered with shining flies, but still</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm and with the head torn off. I stopped aghast</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sight of the scattered blood. Here at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one visitor to the island disposed of! There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no traces of other violence about it. It looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though it had been suddenly snatched up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed; and as I stared at the little furry body came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difficulty of how the thing had been done. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague dread that had been in my mind since I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen the inhuman face of the man at the stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew distincter as I stood there. I began to realise</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hardihood of my expedition among these un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known people. The thicket about me became altered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my imagination. Every shadow became some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing more than a shadow,--became an ambush;</seg><seg type="columnLine">every rustle became a threat. Invisible things</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed watching me. I resolved to go back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure on the beach. I suddenly turned away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thrust myself violently, possibly even franti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally, through the bushes, anxious to get a clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">space about me again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stopped just in time to prevent myself emerging</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon an open space. It was a kind of glade in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest, made by a fall; seedlings were already start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up to struggle for the vacant space; and beyond,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dense growth of stems and twining vines and</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashes of fungus and flowers closed in again. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore me, squatting together upon the fungoid ruins</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a huge fallen tree and still unaware of my ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach, were three grotesque human figures. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">was evidently a female; the other two were men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were naked, save for swathings of scarlet cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the middle; and their skins were of a dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinkish drab colour, such as I had seen in no savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. They had fat, heavy, chinless faces, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treating foreheads, and a scant bristly hair upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads. I never saw such bestial-looking crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were talking, or at least one of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">was talking to the other two, and all three had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">648</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">too closely interested to heed the rustling of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach. They swayed their heads and shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">from side to side. The speaker's words came thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sloppy, and though I could hear them distinctly</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not distinguish what he said. He seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to be reciting some complicated gibberish. Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently his articulation became shriller, and spread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his hands he rose to his feet. At that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others began to gibber in unison, also rising to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, spreading their hands and swaying their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies in rhythm with their chant. I noticed then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the abnormal shortness of their legs, and their lank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumsy feet. All three began slowly to circle round,</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising and stamping their feet and waving their</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms; a kind of tune crept into their rhythmic re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citation, and a refrain,--"Aloola," or "Balloola," it</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded like. Their eyes began to sparkle, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ugly faces to brighten, with an expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of strange pleasure. Saliva dripped from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lipless mouths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, as I watched their grotesque and unac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countable gestures, I perceived clearly for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time what it was that had offended me, what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given me the two inconsistent and conflicting im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressions of utter strangeness and yet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangest familiarity. The three creatures engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this mysterious rite were human in shape, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet human beings with the strangest air about</seg><seg type="columnLine">them of some familiar animal. Each of these crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, despite its human form, its rag of clothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rough humanity of its bodily form, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">woven into it--into its movements, into the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of its countenance, into its whole presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">--some now irresistible suggestion of a hog, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinish taint, the unmistakable mark of the beast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stood overcome by this amazing realisation; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the most horrible questionings came rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into my mind. They began leaping in the air, first</seg><seg type="columnLine">one and then the other, whooping and grunting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then one slipped, and for a moment was on all-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fours,--to recover, indeed, forthwith. But that</seg><seg type="columnLine">transitory gleam of the true animalism of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">monsters was enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned as noiselessly as possible, and becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">every now and then rigid with the fear of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered, as a branch cracked or a leaf rustled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I pushed back into the bushes. It was long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I grew bolder, and dared to move freely. My only</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea for the moment was to get away from these</seg><seg type="columnLine">foul beings, and I scarcely noticed that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged upon a faint pathway amidst the trees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then suddenly traversing a little glade, I saw with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unpleasant start two clumsy legs among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, walking with noiseless footsteps parallel with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my course, and perhaps thirty yards away from me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The head and upper part of the body were hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a tangle of creeper. I stopped abruptly, hoping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creature did not see me. The feet stopped as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. So nervous was I that I controlled an impulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to headlong flight with the utmost difficulty. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking hard, I distinguished through the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacing network the head and body of the brute I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen drinking. He moved his head. There was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerald flash in his eyes as he glanced at me from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow of the trees, a half-luminous colour that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In another moment he had vanished behind some</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes. I could not see him, but I felt that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and was watching me again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What on earth was he,--man or beast? What did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he want with me? I had no weapon, not even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick. Fight would be madness. At any rate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thing, whatever it was, lacked the courage to attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Setting my teeth hard, I walked straight to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards him. I was anxious not to show the fear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed chilling my backbone. I pushed through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle of tall white-flowered bushes, and saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty paces beyond, looking over his shoulder at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and hesitating. I advanced a step or two, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing steadfastly into his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?" said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried to meet my gaze. "No!" he s'aid sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, and turning went bounding away from me</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the undergrowth. Then he turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at me again. His eyes shone brightly out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dusk under the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My heart was in my mouth; but I felt my only</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance was bluff, and walked steadily towards him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned again and vanished into the dusk. Oncei</seg><seg type="columnLine">more I thought I caught the glint of his eyes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time I realised how the lateness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hour might affect me. The sun had set some</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes since, the swift dusk of the tropics was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready fading out of the eastern sky, and a pioneer</seg><seg type="columnLine">moth fluttered silently by my head. Unless I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend the night among the unknown dangers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious forest, I must hasten back to the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closure. The thought of a return to that pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunted refuge was extremely disagreeable, but still</seg><seg type="columnLine">more so was the idea of being overtaken in the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">by darkness and all that darkness might conceal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gave one more look into the blue shadows that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed up this odd creature, and then retraced</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way down the slope towards the stream, going</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I judged in the direction from which I had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I walked eagerly, my mind confused with many</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, and presently found myself in a level place</seg><seg type="columnLine">among scattered trees. The colourless clearness</seg><seg type="columnLine">that comes after the sunset flush was darkling; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue sky above grew momentarily deeper, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little stars one by one pierced the attenuated light;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interspaces of the trees, the gaps in the further</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetation, that had been hazy blue in the daylight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew black and mysterious. I pushed on. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">colour vanished from the world. The tree-tops rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the luminous blue sky in inky silhouette,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all below that outline melted into one formless</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness. Presently the trees grew thinner, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shrubby undergrowth more abundant. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a desolate space covered with a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand, and then another expanse of tangled bushes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not remember crossing the sand-opening be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. I began to be tormented by a faint rustling</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my right hand. I thought at first it was fancy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for whenever I stopped there was silence, save for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening breeze in the tree-tops. Then when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to hurry on again there was an echo to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">footsteps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned away from the thickets, keeping to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more open ground, and endeavouring by sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns now and then to surprise something in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">act of creeping upon me. I saw nothing, and never*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished as he turned his head again. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless for a moment, and then with a noiseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">tread began running through the green confusion- theless my sense of another presence grew steadily-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISLAND OF; DR. MOREAU</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">m</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I increased my pace, and after some time came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slight ridge, crossed it, and turned sharply, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding it steadfastly from the further side. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out black and clear-cut against the darkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky; and presently a shapeless lump heaved up mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentarily against the sky-line and vanished again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt assured now that my tawny-faced antagonist</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stalking me once more; and coupled with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was another unpleasant realisation, that I had lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time I hurried on hopelessly perplexed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursued by that stealthy approach. Whatever it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, the Thing either lacked the courage to attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, or it was waiting to take me at some disad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage. I kept studiously to the open. At times</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would turn and listen; and presently I had half</seg><seg type="columnLine">persuaded myself that my pursuer had abandoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chase, or was a mere creation of my disordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination. Then I heard the sound of the sea. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickened my footsteps almost into a run, and im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately there was a stumble in my reai\</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned suddenly, and stared at the uncertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees behind me. One black shadow seemed to leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">into another. I listened, rigid, and heard nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the creep of the blood in my ears. I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my nerves were unstrung, and that my imagi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation was tricking me, and turned resolutely to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the sound of the sea again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a minute or so the trees grew thinner, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I emerged upon a bare, low headland running out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sombre water. The night was calm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear, and the reflection of the growing multitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stars shivered in the tranquil heaving of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea. Some way out, the wash upon an irregular</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of reef shone with a pallid light of its own.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Westward I saw the zodiacal light mingling with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow brilliance of the evening star. The coast fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from me to the east, and westward it was hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den by the shoulder of the cape. Then I recalled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that Moreau's beach lay to the west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A twig snapped behind me, and there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustle. I turned, and stood facing the dark trees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see nothing--or else I could see too much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every dark form in the dimness had its ominous</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality, its peculiar suggestion of alert watchful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. So I stood for perhaps a minute, and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an eye to the trees still, turned westward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross the headland; and as I moved, one among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurking shadows moved to follow me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My heart beat quickly. Presently the broad sweep</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a bay to the westward became visible, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted again. The noiseless shadow halted a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards from me. A little point of light shone on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">further bend of the curve, and the grey sweep of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sandy beach lay faint under the starlight. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps two miles away was that little point of light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To get to the beach I should have to go through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees where the shadows lurked, and down a bushy</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could see the Thing rather more distinctly now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was no animal, for it stood erect. At that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened my mouth to speak, and found a hoarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">phlegm choked my voice. I tried again, and shouted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who is there?" There was no answer. I ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced a step. The Thing did not move, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered itself together. My foot struck a stone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That gave me an idea. Without taking my eyes off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the black form before me, I stooped and picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">this lump of rock; but at my motion the Thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned abruptly as a dog might have done, and slunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliquely into the further darkness. Then I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called a schoolboy expedient against big dogs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted the rock into my handkerchief, and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">this a turn round my wrist. I heard a movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">further off among the shadows, as if the Thing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in retreat. Then suddenly my tense excitement gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">way; I broke into a profuse perspiration and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">a-trembling, with my adversary routed and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon in my hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was some time before I could summon resolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to go down through the trees and bushes upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flank of the headland to the beach. At last I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">it at a run; and as I emerged from the thicket upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sand, I heard some other body come crashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">after me. At that I completely lost my head with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, and began running along the sand. Forthwith</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came the swift patter of soft feet in pursuit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gave a wild cry, and redoubled my pace. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim, black things about three or four times the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rabbits went running or hopping up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach towards the bushes as I passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So long as I live, I shall remember the terror of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that chase. I ran near the water's edge, and heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">every now and then the splash of the feet that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained upon me. Far away, hopelessly far, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow light. All the night about us was black and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still. Splash, splash, came the pursuing feet, nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nearer. I felt my breath going, for I was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of training; if whooped as I drew it, and I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pain like a knife at my side. I perceived the Thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come up with me long before I reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure, and, desperate and sobbing for my breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wheeled round upon it and struck at it as it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to me,--struck with all my strength. The stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out of the sling of the handkerchief as I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. As I turned, the Thing, which had been running</seg><seg type="columnLine">on all-fours, rose to its feet, and the missile fell fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its left temple. The skull rang loud, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal-man blundered into me, thrust me back with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its hands, and went staggering past me to fall head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long upon the sand with its face in the water; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there it lay still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could not bring myself to approach the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">heap. I left it there, with the water rippling round</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, under the still stars, and giving it a wide berth</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursued my way towards the yellow glow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house; and presently, with a positive effect of relief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the pitiful moaning of the puma, the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had originally driven me out to explore this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious island. At that, though I was faint and</seg><seg type="columnLine">horribly fatigued, I gathered together all my</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, and began running again towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. I thought I heard a voice calling me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Crying of the Mari</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS I drew near the house I saw that the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone from the open door of my room; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I heard coming from out of the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness at the side of that orange oblong of light, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of Montgomery shouting, "Prendick!" I con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued running. Presently I heard him again. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">650</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">replied by a feehle "Hullo!" and in another moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">had staggered up to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where have you been?" said he, holding me at</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm's length, so that the light from the door fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my face. "We have both been so busy that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot you until about half an hour ago." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">led me into the room and set me down in the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. For awhile I was blinded by the light. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not think you would start to explore this island</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ours with telling us," he said; and then, "I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid-- But -- what -- Hullo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My last remaining strength slipped from me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head fell forward on my chest. I think he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain satisfaction in giving me brandy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For God's sake," said I, "fasten that door."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You've been meeting some of our curiosities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eh?" said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He locked the door and turned to me again. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked me no questions, but gave me some more</seg><seg type="columnLine">brandy and water and pressed me to eat. I was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a state of collapse. He said something vague about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his forgetting to warn me, and asked me briefly</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I left the house and what I had seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I answered him as briefly, in fragmentary sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tences. "Tell me what it all means," said I, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">state bordering on hysterics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's nothing so very dreadful," said he. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think you have had about enough for one day."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The puma suddenly gave a sharp yell of pain. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he swore under his breath. "I'm damned,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he, "if this place is not as bad as Gower street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its cats."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Montgomery," said I, "what was that thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came after me? Was it a beast or was it a man?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you don't sleep to-night," he said, "you'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">off your head to-morrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stood up in front of him. "What was that thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that came after me?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked me squarely in the eyes, and twisted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth askew. His eyes, which had seemed animated</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute before, went dull. "From your account,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he, "I'm thinking it was a bogle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt a gust of intense irritation, which passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as quickly as it came. I flung myself into the chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and pressed my hands on my forehead. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">puma began once more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Montgomery came round behind me and put his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on my shoulder. "Look here, Prendick," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "I had no business to let you drift out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">this silly island of ours. But it's Hot so bad as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you feel, man. Your nerves are worked to rags.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let me give you something that will make you</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. That--will keep on for hours yet. You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply get to sleep, or I won't answer for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not reply. I bowed forward, and covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">my face with my hands. Presently he returned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small measure containing a dark liquid. This he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave me. I took it unresistingly, and he helped me</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hammock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I awoke, it was broad day. For a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I lay flat, staring at the roof above me. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rafters, I observed, were made out of the timbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a ship. Then I turned my head, and saw a meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared for me on the table. I perceived that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hungry, and prepared to clamber out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammock, which, very politely anticipating my in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tention, twisted round and deposited me upon all-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fours on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I got up and sat down before the food. I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy feeling in my head, and only the vaguest</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory at first of the things that had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">over night. The morning breeze blew very pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antly through the unglazed window, and that and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the food contributed to the sense of animal comfort</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I experienced. Presently the door behind me</seg><seg type="columnLine">■--the door inward towards the yard of the enclosure</seg><seg type="columnLine">--opened. I turned and saw Montgomery's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," said he. "I'm frightfully busy." And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shut the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterwards I discovered that he forgot to "re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock it. Then I recalled the expression of his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">the previous night, and with that the memory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all I had experienced reconstructed itself before</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Even as that fear came back to me came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry from within; but this time it was not the cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a puma. I put down the mouthful that hesitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my lips, and listened. Silence, save for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper of the morning breeze. I began to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ears had deceived me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a long pause I resumed my meal, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ears still vigilant. Presently I heard some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else, very faint and low. I sat as if frozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my attitude. Though it was faint and low, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved me more profoundly than all that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitherto heard of the abominations behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. There was no mistake this time in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality of the dim, broken sounds; no doubt at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their source. For it was groaning, broken by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobs and gasps of anguish. It was no brute this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time; it was a human being in torment!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I realised this I rose, and in three steps had</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the rooms, seized the handle of the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the yard, and flung it open before me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Prendick, man! Stop!" cried Montgomery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A startled deerhound yelped and snarled. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was blood, I saw, in the sink,--brown, and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarlet,--and I smelt the peculiar smell of carbolic</seg><seg type="columnLine">acid. Then through an open doorway beyond, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dim light of the shadow, I saw something</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound painfully upon a framework, scarred, red,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bandaged; and then blotting this out appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of old Moreau, white and terrible. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he had gripped me by the shoulder with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand that was smeared red, had twisted me off my</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, and flung me headlong back into my own room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lifted me as though I was a little child. I fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">at full length upon the floor, and the door slammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shut out the passionate intensity of his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I heard the key turn in the lock, and Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery's voice in expostulation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ruin the work of a lifetime," I heard Moreau</seg><seg type="columnLine">say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He does not understand," said Montgomery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other things that were inaudible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't spare the time yet," said Moreau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rest I did not hear. I picked myself up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood trembling, my mind a chaos of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible misgivings. Could it be possible, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, that such a thing as the vivisection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men was carried on here? The question shot like</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning across a tumultuous sky; and suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clouded horror of my mind condensed into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivid realisation of my own danger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISLAND OF DR.

I was convinced now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely assured, that Moreau had been vivisect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a human being. All the time since I had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name, I had been trying to link in my mind in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some way the grotesque animalism of the islanders</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his abominations; and now I thought I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all. The memory of his work on the transfusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood recurred to me. These creatures I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen were the victims of some hideous experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.

Nothing. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an inspiration I turned over the deck chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">put my foot on the side of it, and tore away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side rail. It happened that a nail came away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wood, and projecting, gave a touch of danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an otherwise petty weapon. I heard a step out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, and incontinently flung open the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found Montgomery within a yard of it. He meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lock the outer door! I raised this nailed stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mine and cut at his face; but he sprang back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hesitated a moment, then turned and fled round</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner of the house. "Prendick, man!" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard his astonished cry, "don't be a silly ass, man J"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another minute, thought I, and he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had me locked in, and as ready as a hospital rabbit</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my fate. He emerged behind the corner, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard him shout, "Prendick!" Then he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">run after me, shouting things as he ran. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">time running blindly, I went northeastward in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction at right angles to my previous expedition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once, as I went running headlong up the beach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I glanced over my shoulder and saw his attendant</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him. I ran furiously up the slope, over it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then turning eastward along a rocky valley fringed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on either side with jungle I ran for perhaps a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile altogether, my chest straining, my heart beat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in my ears; and then hearing nothing of Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery or his man, and feeling upon the verge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhaustion, I doubled sharply back towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach as I judged, and lay down in the shelter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a canebrake. There I remained for a long time, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful to move, and indeed too fearful even to</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan a course of action. The wild scene about me</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay sleeping silently under the sun, and the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound near me was the thin hum of some small</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnats that had discovered me. Presently I became</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of a drowsy breathing sound, the soughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea upon the beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After about an hour I heard Montgomery shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my name, far away to the north. That set me</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of my plan of action. As I interpreted it</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, this island was inhabited only by these two</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivisectors and their animalised victims. Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these no doubt they could press into their service</seg><seg type="columnLine">against me if need arose. I knew both Moreau and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery carried revolvers; and, save for a'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble bar of deal spiked with a small nail, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">merest mockery of a mace, I was unarmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So I lay still, until I began to think of food and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink; and at that thought the real hopelessness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my position came home to me. I knew no way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting anything to eat. I was too ignorant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">botany to discover any resort of root or fruit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might lie about me; I had no means of trapping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few rabbits upon the island. It grew blanker the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more I turned the prospect over. At last in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperation of my position, my mind turned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal men I had encountered. I tried to find some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope in what I remembered of them. In turn I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recalled each one I had seen, and tried to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">some augury of assistance from my memory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly I heard a stag-hound bay, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that realised a new danger. I took little time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, or they would have caught me then, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatching up my nailed stick, rushed headlong from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hiding-place towards the sound of the sea. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember a growth of thorny plants, with spines</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stabbed like pen-knives. I emerged bleeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with torn clothes upon the lip of a long creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening northward. I went straight into the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a minute's hesitation, wading up the creek,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently finding myself knee-deep in a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream. I scrambled out at last on the westward</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank, and with my heart beating loudly in my ears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept into a tangle of ferns to await the issue. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the dog (there was only one) draw nearer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yelp when it came to the thorns. Then I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more, and presently began to think I had escaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The minutes passed; the silence lengthened out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at last after an hour of security my courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to return to me. By this time I was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much terrified or very miserable. I had, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were, passed the limit of terror and despair. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt now that my life was practcically lost, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">persuasion made me capable of daring anything. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had even a certain wish to encounter Moreau face</seg><seg type="columnLine">to face; and as I had waded into the water, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered that if I were too hard pressed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least one path of escape from torment still lay open</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me,--they could not very well prevent my drown-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing myself. I had half a mind to drown myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">then; but an odd wish to see the whole adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, a queer, impersonal, spectacular interest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, restrained me. I stretched my limbs, sore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and painful from the pricks of the spiny plants, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared around me at the trees; and, so suddenly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed to jump out of the green tracery about it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes lit upon a black face watching me. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was the simian creature who had met the</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch upon the beach. He was clinging to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblique stem of a palm-tree. I gripped my stick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood up facing him. He began chattering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You, you, you," was all I could distinguish at first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he dropped from the tree, and in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment was holding the fronds apart and staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not feel the same repugnance towards this</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature which I had experienced in my encounters</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the other Beast Men. "You, he said, "in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat." He was a man, then,---at least as much of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man as Montgomery's attendant,--for he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," I said, "I came in the boat.

He seemed puzzled at something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes came back to my hands. He held his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own hand out and counted his digits slowly, "One</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, three, four, five--eigh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not grasp his meaning then; afterwards I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to find that a great proportion of these Beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">People had malformed hands, lacking sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">even three digits. But guessing this was in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">way a greeting, I did the same thing by way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply. He grinned with immense satisfaction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then his swift roving glance went round again; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a swift movement--and vanished. The fern</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronds he had stood between came swishing together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I pushed out of the brake after him, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished to find him swinging cheerfully by one</seg><seg type="columnLine">lank arm from a rope of creeper that looped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the foliage overhead. His back was to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Hullo!" said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came down with a twisting jump, and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say," said I, "where can I get something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eat!" he said. "Eat Man's food, now." And</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eye went back to the swing of ropes. "At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huts/'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But where are the huts?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm new, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that he swung round, and set-off at a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk. All his motions were curiously rapid. "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">along," said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went with him to see the adventure out. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed the huts were some rough shelter where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and some more of these Beast People lived. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might perhaps find them friendly, find some handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their minds to take hold of. I did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how far they had forgotten their human heritage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My ape-like companion trotted along by my side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hands hanging down and his jaw thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. I wondered what memory he might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">in him. "How long have you been on this island?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long?" he asked; and after having the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question repeated, he held up three fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The creature was little better than an idiot I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to make out what he meant by that, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems I bored him. After another question or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two he suddenly left my side and went leaping at</seg><seg type="columnLine">some fruit that hung from a tree. He pulled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a handful of prickly husks and went on eating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contents. I noted this with satisfaction, for here</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least was a hint for feeding. I tried him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other questions, but his chattering, prompt</seg><seg type="columnLine">responses were as often as not quite at cross pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses with my question. Some few were appro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">priate, others quite parrot-like.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was so intent upon these peculiarities that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely noticed the path we followed. Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">we came to trees, all charred and brown, and so to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bare place covered with a yellow-white incrusta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, across which a drifting smoke, pungent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiffs to nose and eyes, went drifting. On our</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, over a shoulder of bare rock, I saw the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue of the sea. The path coiled down abruptly into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a narrow ravine between two tumbled and knotty</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of blackish scori®. Into this we plunged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was extremely dark, this passage, after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding sunlinght reflected from the sulphurous</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Its walls grew steep, and approached each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Blotches of green and crimson drifted across</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes. My conductor stopped suddenly. "Home!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he, and I stood on a floor of a chasm that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first absolutely dark to me. I heard some strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">noises, and thrust the knuckles of my left hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">into my eyes. I beeame aware of a disagreeable</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor, like that of a monkey's cage ill-cleaned. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond, the rock opened again upon a gradual slope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sunlit greenery, and on either hand the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">smote down through narrow ways into the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XII.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Sayers of the Law</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN something cold touched my hand. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">started violently, and saw close to me a dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinkish thing, looking more like a flayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">child than anything else in the world. The crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture had exactly the mild but repulsive features of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sloth, the same low forehead and slow gestures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As the first shock of the change of light passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw about me more distintly. The little sloth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like creature was standing and staring at me. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">conductor had vanished. The place was a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage between high walls of lava, a crack in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knotted rock, and on either side interwoven heaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sea-mat, palmfans, and reeds leaning against</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock formed rough and impenetrably dark dens.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The winding way up the ravine between these was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely three yards wide, and was disfigured by</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumps of decaying fruit-pulp and other refuse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which accounted for the disagreeable stench of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The little pink sloth-creature was still blinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me when my Ape-man reappeared at the aper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of the nearest of these dens, and beckoned me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. As he did so, a slouching monster wriggled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one of the places, further up this strange street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood up in featureless silhouette against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright green beyond, staring at me. I hesitated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having half a mind to bolt the way I had come; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, determined to go through with the adventure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gripped my nailed stick about the middle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled into the little evil-smelling lean-to after</seg><seg type="columnLine">my conductor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a semi-circular space, shaped like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of a bee-hive; and against the rocky wall that</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed the inner side of it was a pile of variegated</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruits, cocoa-nuts among others. Some rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessels of lava and wood stood about the floor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one on a rough stool. There was no fire. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkest corner of the hut sat a shapeless mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness that grunted "Hey!" as I came in, and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ape-man stood in the dim light of the doorway and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held out a split cocoa-nut to me as I crawled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other corner and squatted down. I took it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began gnawing it, as serenely as possible, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of a certain trepidation and the nearly intoler-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able closeness of the den. The little pink sloth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature stood in the aperture of the hut, and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else with a drab face and bright eyes cam©</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring over its shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISLAND OF DR'. MOREAU</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">653</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey!" came out of the lump of mystery opposite.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is a man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a man," gabbled my conductor,--"a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man, a five-man, like me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up!" said the voice from the dark, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted. I gnawed my cocoa-nut amid an impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive stillness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I peered hard into the blackness, but could dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguish nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a man," the voice repeated. "He comes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live with us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a thick voice, with something in it--a kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whistling overtone--that struck me as peculiar;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the English accent was strangely good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ape-man looked at me as though he expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">something.

He must learn the Law."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I began to distinguish now a deeper blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the black, a vague outline of a hunched-up figure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I noticed the opening of the place was dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened by two more black heads. My hand tightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my stick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thing in the dark repeated in a louder tone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Say the words."

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice in the dark began intoning a mad litany, line</seg><seg type="columnLine">by line, and I and the rest to repeat it. As they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so, they swayed from side to side in the oddest</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and beat their hands upon their knees; and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed their example. I could have imagined I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already dead and in another world. The dark hut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these grotesque dim figures, just flecked here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there by a glimmer of light, and all of them sway-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in unison and chanting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not to go on all-fours; that is the Law.

A kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythmic fervour fell on all of us; we gabbled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed faster and faster, repeating this amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Law. Superficially the contagion of these brutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">was upon me, but deep down within me the laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disgust struggled together.

Incontinently those at the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hut vanished; my Ape-man rushed out; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that had sat in the dark followed him (I only</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed that it was big and clumsy, and covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with silvery hair), and I was left alone. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I reached the aperture I heard the yelp of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">staghound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another moment I was standing outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovel, my chair-rail in my hand, every muscle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me quivering. Before me were the clumsy backs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of perhaps a score of these Beast People, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">misshapen heads half hidden by their shoulder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blades. They were gesticulating excitedly. Other</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-animal faces glared interrogation out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovels. Looking in the direction in which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced, I saw coming through the haze under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees beyond the end of the passage of dens the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark figure and awful white face of Moreau. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was holding the leaping staghound back, and close</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him came Montgomery revolver in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment I stood horror-struck. I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw the passage behind me blocked by another</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy brute, with a huge grey face and twinkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">little eyes, advancing towards me. I looked round</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw to the right of me and a half-dozen yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of me a narrow gap in the wall of rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which a ray of light slanted into the shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop!" cried Moreau as I strode towards this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, "Hold him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that, first one face turned towards me and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. Their bestial minds were happily slow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I dashed my shoulders into a clumsy monster who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was turning to see what Moreau meant, and flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">him forward into another. I felt his hands fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, clutching at me and missing me. The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink sloth-creature dashed at me, and I gashed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">its ugly face with the nail in my stick, and in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other minute was scrambling up a steep side path-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, a kind of sloping chimney, out of the ravine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard a howl behind me, and cries of "Catch him!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hold him!" and the grey-faced creature appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me and jammed his huge bulk into the cleft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Go on! go on!" they howled. I clambered up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow cleft in the rock and came out upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulphur on the westward side of the village of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beast Men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That gap was altogether fortunate for me, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow chimney, slanting obliquely upward, must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have impeded the nearer pursuers. I ran over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white space and down a steep slope, through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered growth of trees, and came to a low-lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch of tall reeds, through which I pushed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dark, thick undergrowth that was black and</seg><seg type="columnLine">succulent under foot. As I plunged into the reeds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my foremost pursuers emerged from the gap. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke my way through this undergrowth for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. The air behind me and about me was soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of threatening cries. I heard the tumult of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuers in the gap up the slope, then the crash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the reeds, and every now and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackling crash of a branch. Some of the creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared like excited beasts of prey. The staghound</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelped to the leffc. I heard Moreau and Montgomery</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting in the same direction. I turned sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right. It seemed to me even then that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Montgomery shouting for me to run for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the ground gave rich and oozy under</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet; but I was desperate and went headlong</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it, struggled through knee-deep, and so came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a winding path among tall canes. The noise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pursuers passed away to my left. In one place</seg><seg type="columnLine">three strange, pink, hopping animals, about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of cats, bolted before my footsteps. This path-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way ran up-hill, across another open space covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with white incrustation, and plunged into a cane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brake again. Then suddenly it turned parallel with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of a steep-walled gap, which came without</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning, like the ha-ha of an English park,--turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an unexpected abruptness. I was still running</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all my might, and I never saw this drop until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was flying headlong through the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I fell on my forearms and head, among thorns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rose with a torn ear and bleeding face. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen into a precipitous ravine, rocky and thorny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of hazy mist which drifted about me in wisps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a narrow streamlet from which this mist</seg><seg type="columnLine">came meandering down the centre. I was astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this thin fog in the full blaze of daylight; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had no time to stand wondering then. I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my right, down-stream, hoping to come to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea in that direction, and so have my way open to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drown myself. It was only later I found that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped my nailed stick in my fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the ravine grew narrower for a space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carelessly I stepped into the stream. I jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out again pretty quiekly, for the water was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">655</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">boiling. I noticed too there was a thin sulphurous</seg><seg type="columnLine">scum drifting upon its coiling water. Almost im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately came a turn in the ravine, and the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct blue horizon. The nearer sea was flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun from a myriad facets. I saw my death be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore me; but I was hot and panting, with the warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood oozing out on my face and running pleasantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through my veins. I felt more than a touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">exultation too, at having distanced my pursuers. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not in me then to go out and drown myself yet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I started back the way I had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I listened. Save for the hum of the gnats and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chirp of some small insects that hopped among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorns, the air was absolutely still. Then came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yelp of a dog, very faint, and a chattering and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gibbering, the snap of a whip, and voices. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew louder, then fainter again. The noise receded</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the stream and faded away. For a while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chase was over; but I knew now how much hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of help for me lay in the Beast People.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIII.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Parley</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I TURNED again and went on down towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea. I found the hot stream broadened</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to a shallow, weedy sand, in which an</seg><seg type="columnLine">abundance of crabs and long-bodied, many-legged</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures started from my footfall. I walked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very edge of the salt water, and then I felt I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was safe. I turned and stared, arms akimbo, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick green behind me, into which the steamy ravine</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut like a smoking gash. But, as I say, I was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of excitement and (a true saying, though those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who have never known danger may doubt it) too</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate to die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it came into my head that there was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance before me yet. While Moreau and Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gomery and their bestial rabble chased me through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island, might I not go round the beach until I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to their enclosure,--make a flank march upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, in fact, and then with a rock lugged out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their loosely-built wall, perhaps, smash in the lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the smaller door and see what I could find (knife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol, or what not) to fight them with when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned ? It was at any rate something to try.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I turned to the westward and walked along by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water's edge. The setting sun flashed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding heat into my eyes. The slight Pacific tide</seg><seg type="columnLine">was running in with a gentle ripple. Presently the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore fell away southward, and the sun came round</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my right hand. Then suddenly, far in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me, I saw first one and then several figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerging from the bushes,--Moreau, with his grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">staghound, then Montgomery, and two others. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They saw me, and began gesticulating and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vancing. I stood watching them approach. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">two Beast Men came running forward to cut me</seg><seg type="columnLine">off from the undergrowth, inland. Montgomery</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, running also, but straight towards me. Mor- '</seg><seg type="columnLine">eau followed slower with the dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last I roused myself from my inaction, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning seaward walked straight into the water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The water was very shallow at first. I was thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards out before the waves reached to my waist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dimly I could see the intertidal creatures darting</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from my feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What are you doing, man?" cried Montgomery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I turned, standing waist deep, and stared at them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Montgomery stood panting at the margin of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">water. His face was bright-red with exertion, his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long flaxen hair blown about his head, and his drop-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ping nether lip showed his irregular teeth. Moreau</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was just coming up, his face pale and firm, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the dog at his hand barked at me. Both men had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heavy whips. Farther up the beach stared the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Beast Men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What am I doing? I am going to drown my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self," said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Montgomery and Moreau looked at each other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why?" asked Moreau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Because that is better than being tortured by</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I told you so," said Montgomery, and Moreau</seg><seg type="columnLine">said something in a low tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What makes you th.ink I shall torture you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Moreau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What I saw," I said. "And those--yonder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Hush!" said Moreau, and held up his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will not," said I. "They were men: what</seg><seg type="columnLine">are they now? I at least will not be like them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I looked past my interlocutors. Up the beach'</seg><seg type="columnLine">were M'ling, Montgomery's attendant, and one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white-swathed brutes from the boat. Farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, in the shadow of the trees, I saw my little Ape-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and behind him some other dim figures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Who are these creatures?" said I, pointing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and raising my voice more and more that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might reach them. "They were men, men like</seg><seg type="columnLine">yo.urselves, whom you have infected with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">bestial taint,--men whom you have enslaved, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom you still fear. You who listen," I cried, point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing now to Moreau and shouting past him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beast Men,--"You who listen! Do you not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">these men still fear you, go in dread of you ? Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, do you fear them ? You are many--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "For God's sake," cried Montgomery, "stop that,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Prendick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Prendick!" cried Moreau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They both shouted together, as if to drown my</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice; and behind them lowered the staring faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Beast Men, wondering, their deformed hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging down, their shoulders hunched up. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, as I fancied, to be trying to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, to remember, I thought, something of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">human past.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I went on shouting, I scarcely remember what,</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that Moreau and Montgomery could be killed, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were not to be feared: that was the burden</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what I put into the heads of the Beast People.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw the green-eyed man in the dark rags, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had met me on the evening of my arrival, come out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from among the trees, and others followed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear me better. At last for want of breath I</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Listen to me for a moment," said the steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of Moreau; "and then say what you will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">.
