It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all in a man's work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At noon Marie, brown hair flying, red</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks still redder, if possible, skirt tucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around her knees, and bare feet stamping</seg><seg type="columnLine">an emphasis to her rage, was bitterly anil</seg><seg type="columnLine">raucously reviling a regiment of invading</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavalrymen--" great, hulking, lazy swine,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she dubbed them--who trampled the gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den truck into the ground from whence</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had sprung, stampeded the two cows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned the sheds to give their approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing field-guns a free range of the garrisoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">town in the distance, and created a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounding havoc. All of which was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intense delight of eighteen-months-old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little Lenz and the boiling, choking, smoth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering exasperation of buxom Marie, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time in her twenty-one years</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell back for relief upon the profanity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her fathers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At night Big Lenz, hung with cartridges,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin cup, blanket, and smaller accouterment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a Christmas-tree is strung with baubles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">detrained in the open country some sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from his dismantled farm. He washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a shallow creek, ate what was handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him from a perambulating army kitchen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the locomotive whistle shriek, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the train back away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He noted that the camp lay between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream and a woodland, that sentries were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown out on every side, and precautions</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken against sudden attack. Off in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance heavy guns barked and coughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">dully, but no shells came his way. At an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other point a great red reflection on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark sky showed where a village was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames.

He was lucky, escaping sentry de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail, and having nothing to do but smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and talk, and then, when the excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">had died down, to roll in his blanket and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">42</seg><seg type="columnLine">WOMEN AND CHILDREN LAST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep with his head pillowed on his rifle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">butt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here was genuine novelty; a man s pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time; something to remember when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown old. So he continued to whistle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hum by turns. Why not? Had he known</seg><seg type="columnLine">" This Is the Life." he would have added</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tune his repertoire. For Big Lenz,</seg><seg type="columnLine">manlike, was happy on a full stomach and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a full pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did give a fleeting thought to Marie</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the boy. What were they doing? Hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a fine time, probably, with plenty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat and little to do. But why speculate?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surely they were being cared for as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards of a watchful and paternal govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.

Little Lenz cuddled in the crook of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arm, and in his baby dreams he pum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meled the mother's hard flesh with his tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists, just as he had heard her threaten to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pummel the despoilers of the Struegman</seg><seg type="columnLine">acre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Struegman house had been taken--</seg><seg type="columnLine">only temporarily, Marie had been informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a fiercely mustached colonel, who bris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled with hair and side-arms--as a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">combined mess-hall and headquarters for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officers of a cavalry outpost. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence, shed, growing plant, and vine had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been leveled with the ground. Only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house remained, and that merely through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy's temporary necessity. Doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less it, too, would be razed when the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns began to boom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of Marie's oxlike stoicism fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and she wept in a shaking, mum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling, heaving manner. Her woman's heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">was great in proportion to her body and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. She had not often cried in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, and her sobs were almost cataclysmal</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she held Little Lenz to her and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort in his sleepy blows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She thought of Big Lenz and how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fared. She knew his danger was great.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had heard her elders speculate on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">war, and speak of the million lives it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would surely cost when it came. Ponder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the possible death of Big Lenz was</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible, not because she questioned her</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability to provide for Little Lenz--she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength to make a living for a dozen such</seg><seg type="columnLine">~--but because she loved her man. and their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">, 0 anfl a half years of married life had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been very happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lenz and Marie were still reckoned as</seg><seg type="columnLine">honeymooners by the neighbors. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">home had been built with their own strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms. Wedded when they were both chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren in years, they had already come up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from little or nothing to a fair degree of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prosperity, and certainly to much content-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. But in a moment this meager for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune had utterly vanished--and Lenz, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be gone forever, just like the crops</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the cows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, because there were others crying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it became monotonous and unsatisfy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to weep where none had time to sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathize, Marie finally ceased and fell into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sleep disturbed by visions of battle, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaps of dead and wounded men. each with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of her Big Lenz, and of Death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caparisoned like a gigantic, ruthless soldier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding his coal-black steed through smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flame and withering, hopeless catas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trophe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three days later Big Lenz had his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell of battle.

A mile away, on either side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a grove of trees, little brown spots rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell. With each rising there were tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">jets of smoke, white in the clear air, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon disappearing on the breeze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The enemy was pushing forward in</seg><seg type="columnLine">force, coming on relentlessly, as- he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been doing for days. Those bobbing spots,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now visible, now hidden, were his skirmish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, sent out to reconnoiter, to feel out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposition, to pick out and lay bare any</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak spots, then to draw aside, so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field-guns could mow and harrow a path</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the vanguard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Already, high over the heads of the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vancing skirmishers, the shells from the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns in the rear described their swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">parabolas. There was a rumbling roar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant and tremendous, as the monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">war engines belched shot after shot. Look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing far off, Lenz could see them mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on hillocks, and for a time he unconsciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">became oblivious to other things in noting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interval between the appearance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">puff of smoke at the cannon's muzzle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUNSEY'S MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the instant when the dull boom reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard two officers, stop-watches in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, figuring in split seconds the precise</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference between sight of smoke and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of shot, to determine the actual dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance of the batteries. But this was car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rying things too far afield for Lenz. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">technical discussion appealed to him much</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than the more immediate and vital</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that a comrade ten feet away had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunk to the ground with a bullet through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest, just as the man he had slept next</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the night before was being carried away</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleeding from a ghastly open shrapnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound in his neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now, with the onrush of the skirmishers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the enemy's plan became apparent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the shelter of the grove and its under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush a masked battery of machine guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened viciously on the brigade of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Lenz was a unit. While attention had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been diverted to skirmishers and distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">field cannon, these small and spindling</seg><seg type="columnLine">slayers, little larger than a photographer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tripod and camera, had been slipped among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees under cover of a hill just behind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was impossible to locate them exactly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but from their concealment beyond leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vines the accuracy of their aim and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effectiveness of their leaden storm were</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon evident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men, dead and wounded, began to reel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drop, singly, in pairs, by the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen.

Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow mind of Big Lenz realized the need of</seg><seg type="columnLine">action, and with his tardy realization came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sharp order to advance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was in this danger-fraught instant â¢</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Fame, singling out Big Lenz for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, touched his shoulder and signaled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on.

What is the nominal strength,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what the effective force, of the Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional Guard?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the most recent reports, the organized</seg><seg type="columnLine">militia comprises 8,323 officers and 119,087</seg><seg type="columnLine">enlisted men. Of these 7,600 belong to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast artillery; the rest to the mobile forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of militia. But the military authorities de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cline to regard the organized militia, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">National Guard, as an even reasonably</seg><seg type="columnLine">effective military resource.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While this militia force nominally con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sists of 127,410 officers and men, the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent report shows that only 81 per cent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these attended the annual inspections;</seg><seg type="columnLine">only 73.8 per cent attended the camps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruction; only 52 per cent had any prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tise with the rifle during the target season;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only 33.4 per cent qualified as first-</seg><seg type="columnLine">class or second-class marksmen!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not only this. The regulations require</seg><seg type="columnLine">militia units to have at least twenty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">drills of one hour each per annum--cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly a most moderate requirement; yet a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very large proportion failed to get even this</seg><seg type="columnLine">small amount of drill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If it were required to place the militia</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the field, the government would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found very deficient in equipment.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">other words, besides horseless cavalry, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a fine provision of gunless artillery!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These deficiencies cannot be remedied</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the patriotic fervor of earnest na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional purpose.

But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">took two full years from the beginning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Civil War to get armies into the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in training; on the other hand, Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Britain, which has only a little more popu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation than North and South together had</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the beginning of the Civil War, has per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps a million effective soldiers Â»n the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, and promises another million in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very few months. Why is Great Britain</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to turn out the best soldiers in so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much shorter time than our country could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This inquiry brings forward instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difference between the British military</seg><seg type="columnLine">system and the American. Britain main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains a small standing army, and is un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely ever to depart for any considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">time from that policy, because democracies</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate great military establishments. But in</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent years--that is, since the Boer War</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Britain has organized her reserves so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they can be made effective in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortest possible time when need is pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The United States has no such plan. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">we expect to maintain our place as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, it would seem that the smallness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the regular army ought to be the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing argument for a greater and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">effective reserve system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our organized militia, or National</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guard, is not to be confounded with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reserves of other countries.

The militia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, however, take only the preparatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, as a rule; they do not expect to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go from the militia to the regular army,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seldom do so. There is no contempla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of such promotion under our system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following out this comparison of a mili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary establishment with an educational</seg><seg type="columnLine">system, it might be said that our National</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guard is a small body of grade-school boys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">learning a little about the " three R's " of</seg><seg type="columnLine">war, and never expecting to take more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">this elementary course. The reserve of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great military country is the body of citi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zenship that has taken the grade, high</seg><seg type="columnLine">school, and college courses in military</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs, has graduated, and is organized in</seg><seg type="columnLine">readiness to return, with this ripeness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment, and to serve whenever it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">called upon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is not so much the smallness of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular army as this utter lack of a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve that constitutes the telling weakness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our military system.

This plan has made our</seg><seg type="columnLine">wars long and expensive. In the Civil</seg><seg type="columnLine">War, both sections were on an equal foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, in that neither had any proper or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganization for putting into the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained, effective armies.

Allowing for deaths and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">losses, he finds that in the first year after</seg><seg type="columnLine">this scheme came into full operation, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have a reserve of 58,700; a year</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, a reserve of 117,400; in the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">year, a reserve of 176,100; in the fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">year, a reserve of 234,800; and in the fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">year, a reserve of 293,500. Adding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular army of 205,000 to this last, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">total of 498,500 available troops is pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> General Wotherspoon's plan could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">modified by shortening the period of serv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice with the colors, or lengthening the</seg><seg type="columnLine">period during which men should be under</seg><seg type="columnLine">obligation as reservists, or both, so as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">expand the total available force. He does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not propose to abolish the militia as now</seg><seg type="columnLine">established, but to make this regular army</seg><seg type="columnLine">reserve independent of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He does not, however, place much re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liance in the militia, observing that " un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less there be a material change in the laws</seg><seg type="columnLine">governing it, which will bring about an</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased control by the general govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, that branch of our military estab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lishment cannot be regarded and depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon as a reliable force." He suggests,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, that changes could be made in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the militia system, placing it under pay of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Federal government and under obliga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to serve it in case of war.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To produce the desired efficiency, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be necessary to detach numbers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers from the regular army to help train</seg><seg type="columnLine">the militia.

All the authorities in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sist that our military academy at West</seg><seg type="columnLine">Point is the finest institution of its kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world; but it does not educate a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient number of officers to handle an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enlarged army. In Great Britain, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the present war began, the heavy loss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers in actual service has constituted</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the most difficult problems. A sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dier may be trained to reasonable effi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciency in a comparatively short time, es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecially under conditions of actual service;</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so an officer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Various plans have been proposed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">remedying this very serious defect. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious one, but still insufficient, is to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crease the number of cadets at West Point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, of course, would be necessary if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular army were to be raised to about</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred thousand men. In addition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is probable that picked men from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, rising through the non-commissioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">grades, would be promoted to commissions</seg><seg type="columnLine">as fast as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Further, it has been proposed to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of the military training establishments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of schools and colleges to equip a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of young officers to such an extent</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they could later be given a " finishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">course " in the regular army. Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Britain has a system of this sort, known as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Officers' Training Corps, which has</seg><seg type="columnLine">done her good service in time of need by</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplying several thousand officers for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">army she is now forming. Various similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">schemes have been worked out in more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less detail for use in the United States,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but none has yet been approved by ulti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate military authority.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is observable that the military au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorities of this country and of Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Britain have in recent years turned often</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the example of the Swiss military sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem. Switzerland has a completely demo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cratic army--that is, every man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alpine republic is required to give military</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUNSEY'S MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">service if he is physically fit; and rank in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the army is solely a matter of merit. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">son of a peasant may command the son of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the richest banker in the canton, and noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing is thought of it. Where every man</seg><seg type="columnLine">must give his required stint of service to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the army there is an instant end to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">notions that the army is a refuge for men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who have failed elsewhere. The uniform</seg><seg type="columnLine">commands the respect that is due to it, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it is every man's uniform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is a curious commentary on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">democracy of America and Britain that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">both there is apparent an attitude of snob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bishness which makes the men in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">country's uniform feel that they are looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon as inferiors.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical preparation is continued when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men reach the age for enlistment, which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty.

For a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face seemed to bode danger, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supreme self-confidence of the fakir was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much for him, and he walked away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttering strange, harsh sentiments in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">language of Quebec.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as the September sun got low</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the fringe of trees on the western</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the fair-grounds, Dick Burnell put</seg><seg type="columnLine">his little blocks and his watches and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheap jewelry in the black bag, together</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the green baize cloth. It was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rules to leave the scene of his opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions a little earlier than too late.

The face of the thin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale young minister and the faces of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">committee wore expressions that testified</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their disappointment There was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subdued hum of low talk, such as might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard at funerals.

" Why don't you drop over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sale?

" I'll drop in</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, I guess, and see what's going on."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick put on his best necktie, flicked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boots, and waved his front curly hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his satisfaction, and then went over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Odd-Fellows' Hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moment the fakir passed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door a feeling swept over him that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was somewhere he ought not to be. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell of popcorn assailed his nostrils in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of the sawdust-and-beer odor with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he was more familiar. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the delicate, modest scent of white dresses</seg><seg type="columnLine">just taken out of bureau drawers, far dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent from the choking, musky perfume</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he associated with the region of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thirty-Sixth Street and Sixth Avenue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he went into winter quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " This is no place for anybody but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minister's son," he murmured to himself as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still he had a curiosity to see what this</seg><seg type="columnLine">world was like. It was certainly different</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his--that is, the world of his mature</seg><seg type="columnLine">years.

So</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began to buy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bought popcorn and gave it to small</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys and girls, who took it with scared but</seg><seg type="columnLine">thankful faces.

It left the roll sadly emaciated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be sure, but the effect on the spectators</seg><seg type="columnLine">was galvanic. Mr. Perkins, of Perkins &amp;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Son, took the money gingerly, as if he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was something wrong about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He swept up the remaining tickets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed them over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick glanced around.

Over at the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the freckled-faced youth to whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had returned the embezzled funds point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a finger at him and talking volubly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his neighbor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Don't you know who that feller is?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy was saying, gurgling with excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment at being able to impart sensational</seg><seg type="columnLine">information.

The word " bet " was rather ill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chosen: but Dick, with the perfectly honest</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit of the gambler, never suspected that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had said anything inept. He stuck his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands nonchalantly into his trouser-pockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fed himself liberally upon his new</seg><seg type="columnLine">popularity.

One or two of them glared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Dick as if he had committed some</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange crime.

Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he smiled, held up a card, and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I've got it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A murmur of relief ran through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Please to step forward," called the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouncer.

I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a sophomore in college. Lillian was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nineteen and I was twenty. She was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rather frail girl, but very sweet and lov-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able. I gazed at her, I think, much as an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">owl would have gazed, and said very little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Our god of love was not blind, but he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a bit dumb. We understood each other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perfectly--there was not much to under-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stand--and, finding little to talk about,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we used to read together the classics of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">English literature. She had very little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sense of humor, I fear; and as I write this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I am unable to see how I could have had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I have often recalled with a smile my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">occasional misgivings about our speech-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lessness.

I found difficulty in leading</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up to the subjects, and rather envied the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clergyman who could bluntly read a text</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and sail in; but the conclusion was easy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lillian expressed a genuine but monosyl-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">labic agreement with my sentiments, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the exhausted subject died. We preferred</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">silence to commonplaces, and we seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to have no other alternative--except our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">classics, to which we precipitately fled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Though not a conversationalist, Lillian</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> was far from stupid.

Her eyes I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have never forgotten. They sparkled' with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an intelligence that was always alert, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sense of humor that seemed to be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinually on the trail of something, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time with a tenderness which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have always thought was very remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">in so young a girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like Lillian, she was capable at mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matics; but, unlike Lillian, I think she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fonder of misapplied than of applied</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematics.

Again and again I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote to you; but believe me, it was never really</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you I wrote, but to my own husband and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own boy, neither of whom have ever let me say</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them the things that are in me--the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that I have said to you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mr. Bedford, the picture I sent you has noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to do with me.

He showed these</seg><seg type="columnLine">willingly, but was very reserved as to any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else. He had had an " amusing time."</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.

However, we had no reason</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to think that Heyst was in any way a fighting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was about this time that Heyst became</seg><seg type="columnLine">associated with Morrison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day Heyst turned up in Timor.

That was only his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aggerated style of talking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morrison was " one of us." He was owner</seg><seg type="columnLine">and master of the Capricorn, trading brig, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was understood to be doing well with her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for too much autruism. He was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dearly beloved friend of a number of remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">villages up dark creeks and obscure bays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he traded for " produce."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He would often sail through awfully danger-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ous channels up to some village, only to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">115</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a very hungry population clamorous for rice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and without so much " produce " between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as would have filled Morrison's suit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">case. He would land the rice all the same,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid general rejoicings, explain to the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was an advance, that they were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">debt to him now; would preach to them energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and industry, and make an elaborate note in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket diary which he always carried; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this would be the end of that transaction. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know if Morrison thought so, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">villagers had no doubt whatever about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We used to remonstrate with him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You will never see any of your advances</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you go on like this, Morrison."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would put on a knowing air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I shall squeeze them yet some day--never</seg><seg type="columnLine">you fear!

Being hailed across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, he looked up with a wild, worried ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression. He was really in despair. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come the week before into Delli, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portuguese authorities, on some pretense of ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularity in his papers, had inflicted a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him and had arrested his brig.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morrison never had any spare cash in hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With his system of trading it would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange if he had; and all these debts entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pocketbook weren't good enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise a milreis on--let alone a penny. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portuguese officials begged him not to distress</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. They gave him a week's grace, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then proposed to sell the brig at auction. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant ruin for Morrison; and when Heyst</seg><seg type="columnLine">hailed him across the street in his usual court-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly tone, the week was nearly out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst crossed over, and said with a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow, and in the manner of a prince addressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">another prince on a private occasion:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What an unexpected pleasure!

So, instead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of going on his knees, as he felt inclined to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">do, Morrison stretched out his hand, which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Heyst' grasped with formal alacrity and a po-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lite murmur:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   " Trifle--delighted--of service."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" Miracles do happen," thought the awe-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">struck Morrison. To him, as to all of us in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the islands, this wandering Heyst, who didn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">toil or spin visibly, seemed the very last person</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to be the agent of Providence in an affajr</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">concerned with money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As they were trudging together through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sand of the roadway to the custom-house--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">another mud hovel--to pay the fine, Morrison</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">oke into a cold sweat, stopped short, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">claimed in faltering accents:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I say! You aren't joking, Heyst?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Joking!

Heyst. You must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent by God in answer to my prayer. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been nearly off my chump for three days with</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry; and it suddenly struck me: 'What if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's the devil who sent him?' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I have no connection with the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural," said Heyst graciously, moving on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Nobody has sent me.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew very well his inability to lay by any sum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of money. It was partly the fault of circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances and partly of his temperament; and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been very difficult to apportion the</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsibility between the two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I don't know how it is that I can't save,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he observed, with a worried air. " It's some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of curse. There's always a bill or two to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He plunged his hand into his pocket for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous note-book so well known in the islands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fluttered the pages feverishly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " And yet--look," he went on. " There it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is--more than seven thousand dollars owing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surely that's something!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ceased suddenly. Heyst, who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the time trying to look as unconcerned as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could, made reassuring noises in his throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Morrison was not only honest. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">honorable, too; and on this stressful day, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore this amazing emissary of Providence, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the revulsion of his feelings, he made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great renunciation. He renounced the abiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">illusion of his existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " No. No. They are no good. I'll never</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to squeeze them. Never! I've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying for years I would; but I give up. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never really believed I could. Don't reckon</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that, Heyst. I have robbed you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poor Morrison actually laid his head on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin table, and remained in that crushed at-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">titude while Heyst talked to him soothingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Swede was as much distressed as Morri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son; they must have had, both of them, a fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly painful time of it in the cabin of the brig.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the end Morrison, casting desperately for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an idea in the blackness of his despondency,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit upon the notion of inviting Heyst to travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him in his brig and have a share in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">trading ventures up to the amount of his loan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It is characteristic of Heyst's unattached,</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating existence that he was in a position to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept this proposal. There is no reason to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that he wanted particularly just then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go poking aboard the brig into* all the holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and corners of the archipelago where Morri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son picked up most of his trade. Far from it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he would have consented to almost any</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangement in order to put an end to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">harrowing scene in the cabin. There was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once a great transformation act. Morrison</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his diminished head and stuck the glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eye to look affectionately at Heyst; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle was uncorked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was agreed that nothing should be said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to any one of this transaction. Morrison, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand, was not proud of the episode; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was afraid of being unmercifully chaffed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An old bird like me! To let myself be</seg><seg type="columnLine">trapped by those Portuguese rascals! I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">never hear the last of it. We must keep it</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From quite other motives, among which his</seg><seg type="columnLine">native delicacy was the principal, Heyst was</seg><seg type="columnLine">even more anxious to bind himself to "silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A gentleman would naturally shrink from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of heavenly messenger that Morrison</seg><seg type="columnLine">would force upon him. It made Heyst un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable, as it was. And perhaps he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not care that it should be known that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">some means, whatever they might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">--sufficient, at any rate, to enable him to lend</seg><seg type="columnLine">money to people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These two men had a duet down there, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">conspirators in a comic opera, of " Sh--ssh, sh</seg><seg type="columnLine">--ssh! Secrecy! Secrecy!" It must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny, because they were very serious about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And for a time the conspiracy was successful</seg><seg type="columnLine">in so far that we all concluded that Heyst</seg><seg type="columnLine">was boarding with the good-natured -- some</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, sponging on the imbecile--Morrison in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brig.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But you know how it is with all such mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teries. There is always a leak somewhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morrison himself, not a perfect vessel by any</seg><seg type="columnLine">means, was bursting with gratitude, and under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stress he must have let out something</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague -- enough to give the island gossip a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. And you know how kindly the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">118</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MCJNSEY'S MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">is in its comments on what it does not under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand. A rumor sprang out that Heyst, hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing got some mysterious hold on Morrison,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fastened himself on him and was sucking</seg><seg type="columnLine">him dry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Those who had traced these mutterings back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to their origin were very careful not to believe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them. The originator, it seems, was a certain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg, a big, manly, bearded creature of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Teutonic persuasion, with an ungovern-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able longue which surely must have worked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on a pivot. Whether he was a lieutenant of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the reserve, as he declared, I don't know. Out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there he was by profession a hotel-keeper, first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in Bangkok, then somewhere else, and ulti-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mately in Sourabaya. He dragged after him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up and down that section of the tropical belt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a silent, frightened little woman with long</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ringlets, who smiled at one stupidly, showing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a blue tooth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I don't know why so many of us patronized</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his various establishments. He was a noxious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ass, and he satisfied his lust for silly gossip</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the cost of his customers. It was he who,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one evening, as Morrison and Heyst went past</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the hotel--they were not his regular patrons--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whispered mysteriously to the mixed company</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">assembled on the veranda:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " The spider and the fly just gone by,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen." Then, very important and con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fidential, his thick paw at the side of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mouth: 11 We are among ourselves; well,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen, all I can say is, don't you ever get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mixed up with that Swede. Don't you ever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">get caught in his web!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Human nature being what it is, having a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">silly side to it as well as a mean side, there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were not a few who pretended to be indignant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on no better authority than a general pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pensity to believe every evil report; and a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">good many others who found it simply funnv</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to call Heyst the Spider--behind his back, of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">course. He was as serenely unconscious of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this as of his several other nicknames.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   But soon people found other things to say</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Ileyst; not long afterward he came very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much to the fore in larger affairs. He blos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">somed out into something definite. He filled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the public eye as the manager on the spot of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Tropical Belt Coal Company, with offices</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in London and Amsterdam, and other things</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about it that sounded and looked grandiose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The offices in the two capitals may have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">consisted--and probably did--of one room in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">each; but at that distance, out East there, all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this had an air. We were more puzzled than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dazzled, it is true; but even the most sober-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">minded among us began to think that there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was something in it. The Tesmans appointed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">agents, a contract for government mail-boats</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">secured, the era of steam beginning for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">islands a great stride forward -- Heyst's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stride!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We heard that Morrison had gone home</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the Suez Canal in order to push the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">magnificent coal idea personally in London.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He parted with his brig and disappeared from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">our ken; but we heard that he had written a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">letter or letters to Heyst, saying that London</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was cold and gloomy; that he was "as lonely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as a crow in a strange country." In truth, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pined after the Capricorn--I don't mean the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tropic; I mean the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Later on he went into Dorsetshire to see his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">people, caught a bad cold, and died with ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">traordinary precipitation in the bosom of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">appalled family. Whether his exertions in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the city of London had enfeebled his vitality</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I don t know; but I believe it was this visit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that put life into the coal idea. Be it as it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">may, the Tropical Belt Coal Company was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">born very shortly after Morrison, the victim</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of gratitude and his native climate, had gone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to join his forefathers in a Dorsetshire church-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Heyst was immensely shocked. He got the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">news in the Moluccas through the Tesmans,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and then disappeared for a time. It appears</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that he stayed with a Dutch government doc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tor in Amboyna, a friend of his who looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">after him for a bit in his bungalow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   He became visible again rather suddenly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his eyes sunk in his head, and with a sort of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">guarded attitude, as if afraid some one would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reproach him with the dealh of Morrison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   As a matter of fact, many of us did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hear of it till months afterward--from Schom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">berg, who disliked Heyst gratuitously and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">made up a piece of sinister whispered gossip:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   That s what comes of having anything to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">do with that fellow. He squeezes you dry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like a lemon, then chucks you out--sends you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">home to die. Take warning by Morrison!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Of course, we laughed at the innkeeper's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suggestions of black mystery. Several of us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heard that Heyst was prepared to go to Eu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rope himself, to push on his coal enterprise</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">personally; but he never went. It wasn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">necessary. The company was formed with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out him, and his nomination of manager in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the tropics came out to him by post.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">From the first he had selected Samburan,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or Round Island, for the central station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Some copies of the prospectus issued in Eu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">â¦</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">119</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rope, having found their way out East, were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passed from hand to hand. We greatly ad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mired the map which accompanied them for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the edification of the shareholders. On it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Samburan was represented as the central spot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the eastern hemisphere, with its name en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">graved in enormous capitals. Heavy lines</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">radiated from it in all directions through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tropics, figuring a mysterious and effective</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">star lines of influence or lines of distance, or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">something of that sort. There's no more ro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mantic temperament on earth than the tem-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perament of a company promoter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Engineers came out, coolies were imported,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bungalows were put up on Samburan, a gal-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jc-ry driven into the hillside, and actually some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">coal got out. These manifestations shook the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soberest minds. For a time everybody in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">islands was talking of the Tropical Belt Coal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Company, and even those who smiled quietly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to themselves were only hiding their un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">easiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Oh, yes; it had come, and anybody could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">see what would be the consequences--the end</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the individual trader, smothered under a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great invasion of steamers. We could not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">afford to buy steamers. Not we!

Put a book into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket, always very polite. Been strolling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wharf and reading.

A bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">started ringing, and he led the way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dining-room as if into a temple, very grave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the air of a benefactor of mankind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A fewt of us who were sufficiently interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to Davidson for details. They were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">many. He told us that he passed to the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Samburan on purpose to see what was go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on. At first, it looked as if that side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island had been altogether abandoned. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was what he expected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, above the dense mass of vegeta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that Samburan presents to view, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head of the flagstaff without a flag. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while steaming across the slight indentation</seg><seg type="columnLine">which for a time was known officially as Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diamond Bay, he made out with his glass the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white figure on the coaling-wharf. It could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one but Heyst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I thought for certain he wanted to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">taken off; so I steamed in. He made no signs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, I lowered a boat. I could not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">another living being anywhere. He had a book</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand. He looked exactly as we have al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways seen him--very neat, white shoes, cork</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet. He explained to me that he had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways had a taste for solitude. It was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ever heard of it, I told him. He only smiled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What could I say? He isn't the sort of man</seg><seg type="columnLine">one can speak familiarly to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    But what's the object? Are you think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of keeping possession of the mine?' I asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ' 'Something of the sort,' he says. 'I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping hold.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     But all this is as dead as Julius Cajsar,' I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried. ' In fact, you have nothing worth hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on to, Heyst.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     Oh, I am done with facts,' says he, put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting his hand to his helmet sharply with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his short bows."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus dismissed, Davidson went on board his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, swung her out, and as he was steaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">away he watched from the bridge Heyst walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing shoreward along the wharf. He marched</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the long grass and vanished--all but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of his white cork helmet, which seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swim in a green sea. Then that, too, disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared. as if it had sunk into the living depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tropical vegetation, which is more</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealous of men's conquests than the ocean, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was about to close over the last ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tige of the liquidated Tropical Belt Coal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Company--A. Heyst, manager in the East.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Davidson, a good, simple fellow in his way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was strangely affected. It is to be noted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew very little of Heyst. He was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those whom Heyst's finished courtesy of at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titude and intonation most strongly discon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certed. He himself was a fellow of fine feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, I think; though, of course, he had no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">polish than the rest of us. We were naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hail-fellow-well-met crowd, with standards</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our own--no worse, I dare say. than other</seg><seg type="columnLine">people's: but polish was not one of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Davidson's fineness was real enough to alter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course of the steamer he commanded. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of passing to the south of Samburan, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it his practise to take the passage along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north shore, within about a mile of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wharf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " He can see us if he likes to see us." re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked Davidson. Then he had an after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought: "I say! I hope he won't think I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am intruding, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We reassured him on the point of correct</seg><seg type="columnLine">behavior. The sea is open to all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This slight deviation added some ten miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">121</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to Davidson's round trip, but as that was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of sixteen hundred miles it did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I have told my owner of it," said the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientious commander.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To serve a Chinese firm is not so bad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once they become convinced you deal straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">by them, their confidence becomes unlimited.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can do no wrong. So Davidson's old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinaman squeaked hurriedly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " All right, all right, all right. You do what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you like, captain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And there was an end of the matter; not</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether, though. From time to time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinaman used to ask Davidson about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man. He was still there, eh?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I never see him," Davidson had to confess</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his owner, who would peer at him silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">through round, horn-rimmed spectacles sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral sizes too large for his little old face. " I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never see him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To me, on occasions, he would say:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I haven't a doubt he's there. He hides.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's very unpleasant." Davidson was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">vexed with Heyst. " Funny thing," he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. " Of all the people I speak to, nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever asks after him but that Chinaman of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine --and Schomberg," he added after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, Schomberg, of course. He was asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody about everything, and arranging the</seg><seg type="columnLine">information into the most scandalous shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">his imagination could invent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From time to time he would step up. his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinking, cushioned eyes, his thick lips, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">very chestnut beard looking full of malice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Evening, gentlemen. Have you got all</seg><seg type="columnLine">you want? So? Good! Well, I am told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle has choked the very sheds in Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diamond Bay. Fact! He's a hermit in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderness now. But what can this manager</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to eat there? It beats me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sometimes a stranger would inquire with</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural curiosity:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Who?

He's turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">hermit from shame. That's what the devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">does when he's found out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hermit! This was the latest of the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">or less witty labels applied to Heyst during</seg><seg type="columnLine">his aimless pilgrimage in this section of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropical belt, where the inane clacking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg's tongue vexed our ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But apparently Heyst was not a hermit by</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperament. The sight of his kind was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">invincibly odious to him. After something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a year and a half in Samburan. he</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly reappeared in the world, broad chest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bald forehead, long mustache, polite manner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all --the complete Heyst, even to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindly, sunken eyes on which there still rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow of Morrison's death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Naturally, it was Davidson who had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a lift out of his forsaken island. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no other opportunities, unless some na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive craft were passing by--a very remote and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsatisfactory chance to wait for. He came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with Davidson, to whom he volunteered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the statement that it was only for a short time</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a few days, no more. He meant to go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Samburan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Davidson expressing his horror at such fool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishness.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was grotesquely fantastic.

Torn and fluttering</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bills, intimating in heavy red capitals " Con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">certs every night," were stuck on the brick</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pillars on each side of the gateway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The walk had been long and confoundedly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sunny. Davidson stood wiping his wet neck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and face on what Schomberg called "the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">piazza." Several doors opened on to it, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all the screens were down. Not a soul was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in sight, not even a China boy--nothing but a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lot of painted iron chairs and tables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Solitude, shade, and gloomy silence--and a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">faint, treacherous breeze which came from un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">der the trees and quite unexpectedly caused</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the melting Davidson to shiver slightly--the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little shiver of the tropics which in Sourabaya,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">especially, often means fever and the hospital</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the incautious white man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The prudent Davidson sought shelter in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nearest darkened room. In the artificial dusk,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beyond the levels of shrouded billiard-tables, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white form heaved up from two chairs on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which it had been extended. The middle of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the day, table d'hote tiffin once over, was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg's easy time. He lounged out, port-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ly, deliberate, on the defensive, the great, fair</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beard like a cuirass over his manly chest. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">did not like Davidson, never a very faithful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">client of his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He hit a bell on one of the tables as he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">went by, and said in a distant, officer-of-the-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reserve manner:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Your desire?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The good Davidson, still sponging his wet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  neck, declared with simplicity that he had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  come to fetch away Heyst, as agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Not here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A Chinaman appeared in response to the.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  bell.

The poster stated</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had had the honor of playing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">select repertoire before various colonial ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellencies, also before pashas, sheiks, chiefs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">H.H. the Sultan of Mascate, et cetera, et</seg><seg type="columnLine">cetera.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Davidson felt sorry for the eighteen lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">performers. He knew what that sort of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like, the sordid conditions and brutal inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dents of such tours led by such Zangiacomos</seg><seg type="columnLine">who often were anything but musicians by</seg><seg type="columnLine">profession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Davidson was staring at the poster, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door somewhere at his back opened, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman came in who was looked upon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg's wife, no doubt with truth. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody remarked cynically once, she wras</seg><seg type="columnLine">too unattractive to be anything else. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion that he treated her abominably was</seg><seg type="columnLine">based on her frightened expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Davidson lifted his hat to her. Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg gave him an inclination of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sallow head and incontinently sat down be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind a sort of raised counter, facing the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a mirror and rows of bottles at her back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her hair was very elaborately done with two</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringlets on the left side of her scraggy neck;</seg><seg type="columnLine">her dress was of silk, and she had come on</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty for the afternoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some reason or other Schomberg exact-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed this from her, though she added nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fascinations of the place. She sat there</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the smoke and noise, like an enthroned</seg><seg type="columnLine">idol, smiling stupidly over the billiards from</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to time, speaking to no one, and no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking to her. Schombcrg himself took no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more interest in her than may be implied in</seg><seg type="columnLine">124</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUNSEY'S MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a sudden and totally unmotived scowl.

Being alone with her, her silence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and open-eyed immobility made him uncom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fortable. He was easily sorry for people. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemed rude not to take any notice of her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He said, in allusion to the poster:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Are you having these people in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">house?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She was so unused to being addressed by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">customers that at the sound of his voice she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jumped in her seat. Davidson was telling us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">afterward that she jumped exactly like a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">figure made of wood, without losing her rigid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">immobility. She did not even move her eyes;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but she answered him freely, though her very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lips seemed made of wood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "They stayed here a fortnight. They are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gone now. They played every evening."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Pretty good, were they?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To this she said nothing: and as she kept</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on staring fixedly in front of her, her silence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">disconcerted Davidson. It looked as if she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had not heard him--which was impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps she drew the line of speech at the ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pression of opinions. Schomberg might have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trained her, for domestic reasons, to keep _</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them to herself. But Davidson felt in honor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">obliged to converse with her; so he said, put-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ting his own interpretation on this surprising</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">silence:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I see--not much account. Such bands</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hardly ever are. An Italian lot, Mrs. Schom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">berg, to judge by the name of the boss? '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She shook her head negatively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " No. He is a German really; only he dyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his hair and beard black for business. Zan-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">giacomo is his business name."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That's a curious fact," said Davidson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His head being full of Heyst, it occurred to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him that she might be aware of other facts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The other members of that orchestra were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">real Italians, were they not?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Mrs. Schomberg said they were not. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  were of all sorts, apparently. " There was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  even one English girl," she added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Poor devil!" said Davidson. "I suppose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  these women are not much better than slaves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  really. Was that fellow with the dyed beard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  decent in his way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The mechanism remained silent. The sym-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  pathetic soul of Davidson drew its own con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  clusions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    "Beastly life for these w'omen!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " When you say an English girl, Mrs. Schom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  bcrg, do you really mean a young girl?

As has been said, he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">easily sorry for people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Where did they go to from here?" he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" She did not go with them. She ran away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This was the pronouncement Davidson ob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tained next. It introduced a new sort of in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well! Well!" he exclaimed placidly; and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then, with the air of a man who knows life:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" Who with?" he inquired with assurance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mrs. Schomberg's immobility gave her an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">appearance of listening intently. Perhaps she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was really listening; but Schomberg must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have been finishing his sleep in some distant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">part of the house. The silence was profound,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and lasted long enough to become startling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then, enthroned above Davidson, she whis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pered at last:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " That friend of yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Oh. you know I am here looking for a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">friend," said Davidson hopefully. "Won't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you tell me--''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I've told you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A mist seemed to roll away from before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Davidson's eyes, disclosing something he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could not believe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " You can't mean it!" he cried. " He's not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the man for it." But the last words came out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a faint voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mrs. Schomberg never moved her head the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">least bit. Davidson, after the shock which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">made him sit up. went slack all over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Heyst! Such a perfect gentleman!" he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed weakly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mrs. Schomberg did not seem to have heard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This startling fact did not tally with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">idea Davidson had of Heyst. He never talked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of women, he never seemed to think of them,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or to remember that they existed; and then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all at once--like this! Running off with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">casual orchestra girl!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " You might have knocked me down with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  feather," Davidson told us some time after-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He confronted our open grins or quiet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  smiles with a serious, round face. Heyst had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  taken the girl away to Samburan; and that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  was no joking matter. The loneliness, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ruins of the spot, had impressed Davidson's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  simple soul. They were incompatible with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  frivolous comments of people who had not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  seen it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">% *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This black jetty, sticking out of the jungle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the empty sea; these roof-ridges of de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">serted houses peeping dismally above the long</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grass! Ough! The gigantic and funereal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blackboard sign of the Tropical Belt Coal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Company, still emerging from a wild growth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of bushes like an inscription stuck above a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grave, added to the general desolation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Thus the sensitive Davidson. The girl must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have been miserable indeed to follow a strange</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man to such a spot. Heyst, had. no doubt,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">told her the truth. He was a gentleman. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no words could do justice to the conditions of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">life on Samburan.

Davidson was stirred to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">depths; and it was easy to see that it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about Heyst that he was concerned.

His white</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth flashed agreeably below the coppery</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizontal bar of his long mustache.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I don't know whether it was his delicacy or</seg><seg type="columnLine">his obesity which prevented Davidson from</seg><seg type="columnLine">clambering upon the wharf. He stood up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat, and, above him. Heyst stooped low</seg><seg type="columnLine">with urbane smiles, thanking him and apolo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gizing for the liberty, exactly in his usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Davidson had expected some change in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, but there was none.

Not to me, of course. I don't care</seg><seg type="columnLine">what people may say, and of course no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">can hurt me. I suppose I have done a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of harm, since I allowed myself to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">.tempted into action. It seemed innocent</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, but all action is bound to be harmful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is why this world is evil upon the whole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I have done with it! I shall never lift a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little finger again. At one time I thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent observation of facts was the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of cheating the time which is allotted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us whether we want it or not; but now I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done with observation, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Imagine poor, simple Davidson being ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in such terms alongside an abandoned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">decaying wharf jutting out of tropical bush!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had never heard anybody speak like this</seg><seg type="columnLine">before; certainly not Heyst, whose conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was concise, polite, with a faint ring of</seg><seg type="columnLine">playfulness in the cultivated tones of his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " He's gone mad," Davidson thought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, looking at the physiognomy above him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the wharf, he was obliged to dismiss the</seg><seg type="columnLine">notion of common, crude lunacy. It was truly</seg><seg type="columnLine">most unusual talk. Then he remembered--in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his surprise he had lost sight of it--that Heyst</seg><seg type="columnLine">now had a girl there. This bizarre discourse</seg><seg type="columnLine">was probably the effect of the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Davidson shook off the absurd feeling, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, wishing to make clear his friendliness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not knowing what else to say:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You haven't run short of stores or any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst smiled and shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " No, no.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the stuff hanging over his arm. " An</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian thing, 1 believe," he added, glancing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm sidewise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It isn't of particular value," said David-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son truthfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Very likely. The point is that it belongs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Schomberg's wife.

I went to stay there from</seg><seg type="columnLine">economy. The Netherlands House is very ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pensive, and they expect you to bring your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own servant with you. It's a nuisance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Of course, of course," protested David-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son hastily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a short silence Heyst returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of the shawl. He wanted to send it</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to Mrs. Schomberg. He said that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be very awkward for her if she vMte</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable, if asked, to produce it. This had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given him, Heyst, much uneasiness. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrified of Schomberg. Apparently she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " And--she helped me--us," he concluded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" She told me so," Davidson replied. " How</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you get round Ler, Heyst? Why, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks too stupid to understand human speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">and too scared to shoo a chicken away. Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women, the women! You don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what there may be in the quietest of them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">" She was engaged in the task of defending</seg><seg type="columnLine">her position in life," said Heyst. " It's a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">respectable task."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Is that it? I had some idea it was that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">confessed Davidson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He then imparted to Heyst the story of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">violent proceedings following on the discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his flight. Heyst's polite attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tale took on a somber cast; but he manifested</seg><seg type="columnLine">no surprise and offered no comment. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davidson had finished he handed down the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shawl into the boat, and Davidson promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do his best to relurn it to Mrs. Schomberg</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some secret fashion. Heyst expressed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks in a few simple words, set off by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of finished courtesy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Davidson prepared to depart. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not looking at each other. Suddenly Heyst</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You understand that this was a case of</seg><seg type="columnLine">odious persecution, don't you? I became</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of it and--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a view which the sympathetic David-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son was capable of appreciating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I am not surprised to hear it," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">placidly. " Odious enough, I dare say. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, of course--not being a married man--</seg><seg type="columnLine">were free to step in. Ah, well!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down in the stern-sheets and already</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the steering-lines in his hands when Heyst</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed abruptly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " The world is a bad dog. It will bite you</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you give it a chance; but I think that here</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can safely defy the fates."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When relating all this to me, Davidson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">only comment was:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Funny notion of defying the fates--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a woman in tow!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soiie considerable time afterward--we did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not meet very often--I asked Davidson how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had managed about the shawl. I heard that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had tackled his mission in a direct way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had found it easy enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the very first call he made at Sourabaya</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rolled the shawl as tightly as he could into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smallest possible brown - paper parcel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he carried ashore with him,. His busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness in the town being transacted, he got into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gharry with the parcel and drove to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel. With his previous experience, he timed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arrival accurately for the hour of Schom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berg's siesta.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finding the place empty, as on the former</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion, he marched into the billiard-room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a seat at the back, near the sort of dais</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Mrs. Schomberg would in due course</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to occupy, and broke the slumbering si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence of the house by thumping a bell vigor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously. Of course a Chinaman appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly. Davidson ordered a drink and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I would have ordered twenty drinks one</seg><seg type="columnLine">after another, if necessary," he said--David-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's a very abstemious man--" rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">take that parcel out of the house again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Couldn't leave it in a corner without letting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman know it was there. It might have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg><seg type="columnLine">130</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUNSEY'S MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turned out worse for her than not bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing back at all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so he waited, ringing the bell again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and swallowing two or three iced drinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he did not want.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, as he hoped it would happen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Schomberg came in, silk dress, long</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, ringlets, scared eyes, and silly grin--all</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete. Probably that lazy beast had sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">her out to see who was the thirsty customer</seg><seg type="columnLine">waking up the echoes of the house at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet hour. Bow, nod--and she clambered up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her regular post behind the raised counter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking so helpless, so utterly inane, as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat there, that if it hadn't been for the parcel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davidson declared, he would have thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had merely dreamed of all that had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ordered another drink, to get the China-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man out of the room, then seized the parcel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was reposing on a chair near him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no more than a mutter--" This is some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of yours "--he rammed it swiftly into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">recess in the counter at her feet. The rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">was her affair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And just in time, too. Schomberg turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, yawning affectedly, almost before David-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son had regained his seat. He cast about</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious and irate glances. An invincible</seg><seg type="columnLine">placidity of expression helped Davidson won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derfully at the moment, and the other, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, could have no grounds for the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion of any sort of understanding between</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife and this customer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to Mrs. Schomberg, she sat there like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">joss. Davidson was lost in admiration. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed, now, that the woman had been put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting it on for years.' She never even winked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was immense! She was a miracle of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">simulation. No wonder Heyst got the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from under two men's noses, if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to help with the job!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Schomberg, wandering about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined a party that had taken the table next</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Davidson's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " A man like that Swede, gentlemen, is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">public danger," he began. " I remember him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for years. I won't say anything of his spy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--well, he used to say himself he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for out-of-the-way facts, and what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if not spying? He was spying into every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body's business. He got hold of Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morrison, squeezed him dry, like you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">an orange, and scared him off to Europe, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">die there. Everybody knows that Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morrison had a weak chest. Robbed first and</seg><seg type="columnLine">murdered afterward! I don't mince words--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not I. Next he gets up that swindle of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Belt Coal. You all know about it. And now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after lining his pockets with other people's</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, he kidnaps a white girl belonging to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an orchestra which is performing in my pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic room for the benefit of my pafrons, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes off to live like a prince on that island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where nobody can get at him. It's disgust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--tfui!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spat. He choked with rage--for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw visions, no doubt. He jumped up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chair and went into the room where Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg sat. Her aspect could not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been very consoling to the sort of pain from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he was suffering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Davidson did not feel called upon to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fend Heyst. His proceeding was to enter into</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation with one and another, casually,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and showing no particular knowledge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair, in order to discover something about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl. Was she anything out of the way?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was she pretty?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She couldn't have been markedly so. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not attracted special notice. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">young--on that everybody agreed. The Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish clerk of Tesman's remembered that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a sallow face. He was respectable and</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly proper. He was not the sort to asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciate with such people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of these women were fairly battered</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimens. Schomberg had them housed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he called the Pavilion, in the grounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they were hard at it mending and wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their white dresses, and could be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging them out to dry between the trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a lot of washerwomen. They looked very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much like middle-aged washerwomen on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform, too. But the girl had been living in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main building along with the boss, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">director, the fellow with the black beard, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hard-bitten, oldish woman who took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">piano and was understood to be the fellow's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was not a very satisfactory result.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davidson stayed on, and even joined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table d'hote dinner, without gleaning any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more information. He was resigned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I suppose," he wheezed placidly, " I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound to see her some day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He meant to take the Samburan channel</seg><seg type="columnLine">every trip, as before, of course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yes," I said. " No doubt you will. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day Heyst will be signaling to you again; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wonder what it will be for!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Davidson made no reply. He had his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas about that, and his silence concealed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good deal of thought. We spoke no more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heyst's girl. Before we separated he gave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piece of unrelated observation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">131</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " It's funny," he said, " but I fancy there's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some gambling going on in the evening at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg's place, on the quiet. I've noticed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">men strolling away in twos and threes toward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that Pavilion, where the orchestra used to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">live. The windows must be specially well</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shuttered, because I could not spy the smallest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gleam of light from that direction; but I can't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">believe that those beggars would go in there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">every evening only to sit and think of their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sins in the dark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That's strange. I can't believe Schom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berg would risk that sort of thing," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As we know, Heyst had gone to stay in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg's hotel in complete ignorance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his person was odious to that worthy. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he arrived, Zangiacomo's Ladies' Orchestra</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been established there for some time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The business which had called him out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his seclusion in his lost corner of the Eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas was with the Tesmans, and it had some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to do with money. He transacted it</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, and then found himself with nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do while he awraited Davidson, who was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take him back to his solitude; for back to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">solitude Heyst meant to go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He whom we used to refer to as the En-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanted He&gt;Â«t was suffering from thorough</seg><seg type="columnLine">disenchantment. Not with the islands, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. The archipelago has a lasting fascina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. It is not easy to shake off the spell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">island life. Heyst was disenchanted with life</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a whole. His scornful temperament, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guiled into action, suffered from failure in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">subtle way unknown to men accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grapple with the realities of common human</seg><seg type="columnLine">enterprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It w'as like the gnawing pain of a useless</seg><seg type="columnLine">apostasy, a sort .of shame before his own be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trayed nature; and, in addition, he also suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered from plain, downright remorse. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">deemed himself guilty of Morrison's death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A rather absurd feeling, since no one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly have foreseen the horrors of the cold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet summer lying in wait for poor Morrison</seg><seg type="columnLine">at home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was not in Heyst's character to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">morose; but his mental state was not com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patible with a sociable mood. He spent his</seg><seg type="columnLine">evenings sitting apart on the veranda of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg's hotel.

"How</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you come to have anything to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannibals?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " It would be too long a tale," said Heyst</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a faint smile in which his playfulness dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. Heyst's smiles were rather melan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">choly, and accorded badly with his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustache, under which his mere playfulness</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurked as comfortably as a shy bird in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">native thicket. " Much too long. How did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you get among this lot here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Bad luck," she answered briefly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " No doubt, no doubt," Heyst assented with</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight nods. Then, still indignant at the pinch</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had divined rather than actually seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflicted: "I say, couldn't you defend your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self somehow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had risen already. The ladies of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">orchestra were slowly regaining their places.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some were already seated, idle, stony-eyed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the music-stands. Heyst was standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " They are too many for me." she said.-</seg><seg type="columnLine">These few words came out of the common</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience of mankind; yet, by virtue of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, they thrilled Heyst like a revelation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On a later evening, during the interval be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the two parts of the concert, the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Heyst about herself. She w-as almost a</seg><seg type="columnLine">child of the streets. Her father was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">musician in the orchestras of small theaters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her mother ran away from him while she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, and the landladies of various poor lodg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-houses had attended casually to her aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">135</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">doned childhood. It was never positive starva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and absolute rags, but it was the hopeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip of poverty all the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was her father who taught her to play</seg><seg type="columnLine">the violin. It seemed that he used to get drunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes, but without pleasure, and only be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he was unable to forget his fugitive wife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After he had a paralytic stroke, and fell over</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a crash in the well of a music-hall or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chestra during the performance, she had joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Zangiacomo company. He was now in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">home for incurables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " And I am here," she finished, " with no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to care if I make a hole in the water the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next chance I get or not!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst told her that he thought she could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little better than that, if it was only a ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of getting out of the world. She looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him with special attention and with a puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled expression which gave to her face an air</seg><seg type="columnLine">of innocence. She had never had a friend be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore; and the sensation of this friendliness</seg><seg type="columnLine">going out to her was exciting by its novelty</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Besides, any man who did not resemble</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg appeared for that very reason at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tractive. She was afraid of the hotel-keeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, in the daytime, taking advantage of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that she lived in the hotel itself and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pavilion with the other " artists,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">prowled round her, mute, hungry, portentous</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind his great beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The contrast of Heyst's quiet, polished man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner gave her special delight and filled her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration. She had never seen anything like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that before. If she had, perhaps, known kind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness in her life, she had never met the forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of simple courtesy. She was interested by it</seg><seg type="columnLine">as by a very novel experience, not very in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligible, but distinctly pleasurable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I tell you they are too many for me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she repeated, sometimes recklessly, but more</seg><seg type="columnLine">often shaking her head with ominous dejec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had, of course, no money at all. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantities of " black men " all about fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened her. She really had no definite idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">where she was on the surface of the globe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The orchestra was generally taken from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer to some hotel, and kept shut up there</seg><seg type="columnLine">till it was time to go on board another</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer. She could not remember the names</seg><seg type="columnLine">she heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " How do you call this place again?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to ask Heyst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Sourabaya," he would say distinctly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would watch the discouragement at the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">landish sound coming into her eyes, which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were fastened on his face. He could not de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fend himself from compassion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He suggested that she might go to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sul, but it was his conscience that dictated this</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice, not his conviction, She had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of the animal or of its uses. A consul!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was it? Who was he? What could he</seg><seg type="columnLine">do? And when she learned that perhaps he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be induced to send her home her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped on her breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What am I to do when I get there?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured with an intonation so true, with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">accent so penetrating--the charm of her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not fail her even in whispering--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heyst seemed to see the illusion of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellowship on earth vanish before the naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth of her existence and leave them both</seg><seg type="columnLine">face to face in a moral desert as arid as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of Sahara, without restful shade, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out refreshing water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She leaned slightly over the little table--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same little table at which they had sat when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they first met each other; and with no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories but of the stones in the streets her</seg><seg type="columnLine">childhood had known, the distress of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incoherent, confused, rudimentary impressions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her travels inspiring her with a vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror of the world, she said rapidly, as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaks in desperation:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You do something!

I don't care what it is, but you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">do something!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her attitude was fierce and entreating at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time--clamorous, in fact, though her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice had hardly risen above a breath. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamorous enough to be noticed. Heyst, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose, laughed aloud. She nearly choked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with indignation at this brutal heartlessness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " W'hat did you mean, then, by saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">' command me '?" she almost hissed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something hard in his mirthless stare and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quiet final " All right " steadied her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I am not rich enough to buy you out." he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on, speaking with an extraordinary de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached grin, "even if it were to be done; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can always steal you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at him profoundly, as if these</seg><seg type="columnLine">words had a hidden and very complicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Get away now," he said rapidly, " and try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to smile as you go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She obeyed with unexpected readiness; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she had a set of very good white teeth the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of the mechanical, ordered smile was</seg><seg type="columnLine">136</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUNSEY'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">joyous, radiant. It astonished Heyst. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder, it flashed through his mind, women</seg><seg type="columnLine">can deceive men so completely. The faculty</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inherent in them; they seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">created with a special aptitude. Here was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, the origin of which was well known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; and yet it had conveyed a sensation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth, had given him a sort of ardor to live,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was very new'to his experience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time she was gone from the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had joined the other " ladies of the or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chestra." They trooped toward the platform,</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven in truculently by the haughty mate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zangiacomo, who looked as if she were re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">straining herself with difficulty from punching</seg><seg type="columnLine">their backs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zangiacomo followed with his great, pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulous dyed beard and short mess-jacket, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an aspect of hangdog concentration imparted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his drooping head and the uneasiness of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, which were set very close together. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed the steps last of all, turned about, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing his purple beard to the hall, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapped with his bow. Heyst winced in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticipation of the horrible racket. It burst out</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately, unabashed and awful. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the platform the woman at the piano,</seg><seg type="columnLine">presenting her cruel profile, her head tilted</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, banged the keys without looking at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">music.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst could not stand the uproar for more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a minute. He went out, his brain racked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the rhythm of some more or less Hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garian dance-music. He sought the obscurity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the peace of his bedroom; but they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not complete. The distant sounds of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cert reached his ear, faint but still disturbing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not attempt to go to sleep; he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even unbutton the top button of his tunic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sat in a chair and mused. Formerly, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">solitude and in silence, he had been used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think clearly and sometimes even profoundly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing life outside the flattering optical de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lusion of everlasting hope, of conventional</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-deception, of an ever-expected happiness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now he was troubled; a light veil seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hang before his mental vision; the awaken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of a tenderness, indistinct and confused as</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, toward an unknown woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually silence, a real silence, had estab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lished itself round him. The concert was over;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the audience had gone; the concert-hall was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark; and even the pavilion wrhere the ladies'</seg><seg type="columnLine">orchestra slept after its noisy labors, showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a gleam of light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst suddenly felt restless in all his limbs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As this reaction from the long immobility</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be denied, he humored it by pass-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing quietly along the back veranda and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the grounds at the side of the house, into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black shadows under the trees, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extinguished paper lanterns were gently swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their globes like withered fruit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paced there to and fro for a long time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a calm, meditative ghost in his white-drill suit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolving in his head thoughts absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">novel, disquieting and seductive; accustoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind to the contemplation of his purpose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order that by being faced steadily it should</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear praiseworthy and wise. For the use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason is to justify the obscure desires that</seg><seg type="columnLine">move our conduct, impulses, passions, preju-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dices, and follies, and also our fears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt that he had engaged himself by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rash promise to an action big with incalcula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble consequences. And then he asked himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the girl had understood what he meant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who could tell? He was assailed by all sorts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of doubts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raising his head he perceived something</seg><seg type="columnLine">white flitting between the trees. It vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost at once; but there could be no mistake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was vexed at being detected roaming like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this in the middle of the night. Who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">that be? It never occurred to him that per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps the girl, too, would not be able to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He advanced prudently. Then he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, fantomlike apparition again; and next</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment all his doubts as to the state of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind were laid at rest, because he felt her</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to him after the manner of suppliants</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the world over. Her whispers were so in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coherent that he could not understand any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing; but this did not prevent him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">being profoundly moved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Calm yourself, calm yourself," he mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mured in her ear, returning her clasp at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanically and afterward with a growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciation of her distressed humanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The heaving of her breast and the trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling of all her limbs, in the closeness of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">embrace, seemed to enter his body, to infect</seg><seg type="columnLine">his very heart. While she was growing quieter</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his arms he was becoming more agitated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if there were only a fixed quantity of violent</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion on this earth. The very night seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">more dumb, more still, and the immobility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vague, black shapes surrounding him more</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It will be all right," he tried to reassure</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, with a tone of conviction, speaking into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ear. and of necessity clasping her more</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely than before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Either the words or the action had' a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">good effect.

His genius ran to catering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man for white men, and to the invent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, elaborating, and retailing of scandalous</seg><seg type="columnLine">gossip with asinine unction and impudent de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.

Remember the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">â¢	knives and revolvers in their trunks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In guise of thanks for that anxious reminder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he swore horribly in the direction of her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shrinking person. In her scanty night-dress,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and barefooted, she seemed like a medieval</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">penitent being reproved for her sin in blas-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">phemous terms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Those lethal weapons were always present</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Schomberg's mind. Personally he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seen them. His part, some three weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, had been to lounge in manly, careless</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitudes on the veranda--on the watch--</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Mrs. Schomberg, provided with a bunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of assorted keys, her discolored teeth chatter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and her globular eyes absolutely idiotic</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fright, was " going through " the luggage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these strange clients. Her terrible Wilhelm</seg><seg type="columnLine">had insisted on it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I'll keep good watch, I tell you," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" I shall give you a whistle when I see them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">coming back. Even if he were to catch you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at it, and chuck you out by the scruff of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">neck, it wouldn't hurt you much; but he won't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">touch a woman. Not he! He has told me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so. Affected beast! I must find out some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing about their little game, and so there's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an end of it. Go in! Go now! Quick,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">march!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It had been an awful job; but she did go</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, because she was much more afraid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg than of any possible consequences</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the act. The trunks, she found, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">left open; but her investigation did not last</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. She was frightened of firearms, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">generally of all weapons, not exactly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal cowardice, but from an abstract</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror of violence and murder. She was out</seg><seg type="columnLine">again on the veranda long before Wilhelm</seg><seg type="columnLine">had any occasion to sound his warning whistle;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nothing could induce her to return to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigations--neither threatening growls nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocious hisses, nor yet a poke or two in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ribs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stupid female!" muttered the hotel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper, perturbed by the notion of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">armory in one of his bedrooms. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">from no abstract sentiment; with him it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">constitutional. "Get out of my sight!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled. " Go and dress yourself for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tabic d'hote</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Left to himself, Schomberg had meditated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What did this mean? His thinking processes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sluggish and spasmodic; but suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth came to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " By Heavens, they are desperadoes!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then he beheld " plain Mr. Jones " and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his secretary with the ambiguous name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo entering the grounds of the hotel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had been down to the port on some</seg><seg type="columnLine">business, and now were returning; Mr. Jones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lank, spare, opening his long legs with angular</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularity, like a pair of compasses, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepping out briskly by his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conviction entered Schomberg's heart. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were two desperadoes--no doubt about it!</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as the funk which he experienced was</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely a general sensation, he managed to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his most severe officer-of-the-reserve man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner long before they had closed in with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Good morning, gentlemen!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Being answered with curiously derisive</seg><seg type="columnLine">civility, he became confirmed in his sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">conviction of their desperate character. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">way Mr. Jones turned his hollow eyes on one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an incurious specter, and the way the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, when addressed, suddenly retracted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips and exhibited his teelh without looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">round--here was evidence enough to settle</seg><seg type="columnLine">that point. Desperadoes! They passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the billiard-room, inscrutably mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious, to the back of the house, to join their</seg><seg type="columnLine">violated trunks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Tiffin bell will ring in five minutes, gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men," Schomberg called after them, exaggera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting the deep manliness of his tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had managed to upset himself very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. He dreaded any kind of disturbance--</seg><seg type="columnLine">" fracas," he called it -- in his hotel. Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things were not good for business. Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes one had to have a "fracas"; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been a comparatively trifling task to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seize the frail Zangiacomo--whose bones were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no larger than a chicken's--round the ribs, lift</seg><seg type="columnLine">him up bodily, dash him to the ground, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall on him. It had been easy. The wretched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hook-nosed creature lay without movement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried under its purple beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, remembering the occasion of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">" fracas," Schomberg groaned with the pain as</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a hot coal under his breast-bone, and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself up to desolation. Ah, if he only had</seg><seg type="columnLine">that girl with him he would have been master-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful and resolute and fearless -- fight twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperadoes -- care for nobody on earth!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whereas the possession of Mrs. Schomberg</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no incitement to a display of manly</seg><seg type="columnLine">virtues.</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">145</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat gloomily through the tiffin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Extreme resolutions at the age of fifty are</seg><seg type="columnLine">seldom final. They settle nothing; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely unsettle the action which at that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life should follow the cold dictates of ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured wisdom. In his state of moral decom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">position, Schomberg, master as he was of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">art of hotel-keeping, and careful of giving no</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion for criticism to the powers regulating</seg><seg type="columnLine">that branch of human activities, let things</seg><seg type="columnLine">take their course; though he saw very well</seg><seg type="columnLine">where that course was tending.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It began first with a game or two after din-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner--for the drinks, apparently--with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingering customer, at one of the little tables</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged against the walls of the billiard-room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg detected the meaning of it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. That's what it was! This was what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moving about restlessly, he cast sidelong</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks at the game; but he said nothing. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not worth while having a row with men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were so overbearing. Even when money</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in connection with these post-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prandial games, into which more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">people were being drawn, he still refrained</seg><seg type="columnLine">from raising the question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One evening, however, after the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms of the hotel had become empty, Schom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berg made an attempt to grapple with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem in an indirect way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a distant corner the tired Chinaman</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozed on his heels, his back against the wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Schomberg had disappeared, as usual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">between ten and eleven. Schomberg walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about slowly, in and out of the room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veranda, thoughtful, waiting for his two</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests to go to bed. Then suddenly he ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached them, militarily, his chest thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, his voice curt and soldierly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hot night, gentlemen!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Jones, lolling back idly in a chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up. Ricardo, as idle, but more up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, at a little table, made no sign.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Won't you have a drink with me before</seg><seg type="columnLine">retiring?" went on Schomberg, sitting down</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruskly by the little table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " By all means," said Mr. Jones lazily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo showed his teeth in a strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick grin. Schomberg felt painfully how</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult it was to get in touch with these men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both so quiet, so deliberate, so menacingly un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremonious. He ordered the Chinaman to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring in the drinks. His purpose was to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover how long these guests intended to stay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo displayed no conversational vein,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Mr. Jones appeared communicative</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. His voice somehow matched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sunken eyes. It was hollow without being in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the least mournful; it sounded distant, unin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested, as if he were speaking from the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom of a well. Schomberg learned that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have the privilege of lodging and board-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing these gentlemen for at least a month more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could not conceal his discomfiture at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of news.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What's the matter? Don't you like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have people in your house?" asked plain Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones languidly. " I should have thought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner of a hotel would be pleased."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lifted his delicate and beautifully pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciled eyebrows. Schomberg muttered some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about the locality being dull and unin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting to travelers--nothing going on--too</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet altogether; but he only provoked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">declaration that quiet had its charms some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, and even dulness was welcome as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">change.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " We haven't had time to be dull for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last three years," added plain Mr. Jones, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes fixed darkly on Schomberg, whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">furthermore invited to have another drink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time with him, and not to worry himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">about things he did not understand; and es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecially not to be inhospitable--which in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel-keeper was highly unprofessional.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I don't understand," grumbled Schom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berg. " Oh, yes, I understand perfectly well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You are frightened," interrupted Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones. " What is the matter?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I don't want any scandal in my place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's what's the matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schomberg tried to face the situation brave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, but that steady, black stare affected him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed to watch for his words with un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fathomable intentions. And when he glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside uncomfortably, he met Ricardo's grin</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncovering a lot of formidable teeth, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man seemed absorbed in his thoughts all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And, moreover," went on Mr. Jones in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that distant tone of his, " you can't help</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself. Here we are and here we stay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would you try to put us out? I dare say</seg><seg type="columnLine">you could do it; but you couldn't do it with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out getting badly hurt--very badly hurt. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">can promise him that, can't we, Martin?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The secretary retracted his lipst and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up sharply at Schomberg, as if only too anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious for an order to leap upon him with teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and claws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schomberg managed to produce a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha, ha. ha!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Jones closed his eyes wearily, as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">146</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUNSEY'S MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">light had hurl them, and looked remarkably</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a corpse for a moment. This was bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough; bul when he opened them again, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost a worse trial for Schomberg's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves. The spectral intensity of that glance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed on the hotel-keeper without any definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression, seemed to dissolve the last grain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of resolution in his character.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You don't think, by any chance, that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to do with ordinary people, do you?" in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired Mr. Jones, in his lifeless manner, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to imply some sort of menace from</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the grave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " He's a gentleman," testified Martin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo with a sudden snap of the lips, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">which his mustache stirred in an odd, feline</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Oh, I wasn't thinking of that," said Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones, while Schomberg, dumb and planted</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily in his chair, looked from one to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, leaning forward a little. " Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am that; but Ricardo attaches too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance to such a social advantage. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">I mean, for instance, is that he, quiet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">inoffensive as you see him sitting here, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">think nothing of setting fire to this house of</seg><seg type="columnLine">entertainment of yours. It would blaze like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">box of matches. Think of that! It wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance your affairs much, would it?--what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever happens to us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Come, come, gentlemen," remonstrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg in a murmur. " This is very wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " And you have been used to deal with tame</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, haven't you? But we aren't tame.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We once kept a whole angry town at bay for</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days, and then we got away with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunder. It was in Venezuela. Ask Martin</seg><seg type="columnLine">here--he can tell you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instinctively Schomberg looked at Ricardo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who only passed the tip of his tongue over his.</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips with an uncanny sort of gusto, but did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not offer to begin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Well, perhaps it would be a rather long</seg><seg type="columnLine">story," Mr. Jones conceded after a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I have no desire to hear it, I am sure,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Schomberg. " This isn't Venezuela. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't get away from here like that. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">all this is silly talk of the w'orst sort. Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean to say you would make deadly trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the sake of a few guilders that you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that other "--eying Ricardo suspiciously, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">one would look at a strange animal--" gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man can win of an evening? 'Tisn't as if my</seg><seg type="columnLine">customers were a lot of rich men with pockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of cash. I winder you take so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble and risk for so little money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schomberg's argument was met by Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones's statement that he lived in this peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, did what he w&gt;as doing, and stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he w;as not wanted, not from any con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderations of profit, but to please his humor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo needed to keep himself in practise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then one must do something to kill time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Killing time was not forbidden. For the rest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being in a communicative mood, Mr. Jones</seg><seg type="columnLine">said languidly and in a voice indifferent, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">issuing from a tomb, that he depended on</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, as if the world were still one great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild jungle without law. Martin was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like that, too--for reasons of his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All these statements Ricardo confirmed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, inhuman grins. Schomberg lowered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, for the sight of these two men intimi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dated him; but he was losing patience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Of course, I could see at once that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were two desperate characters--something like</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you say. Why are you trying to frighten</seg><seg type="columnLine">me now? There's no necessity. It's nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. But what would you think if I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that I am pretty near as desperate as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">two gentlemen? 'That Schomberg has an</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy time running his hotel,' people think;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet it seems to me I would just as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">let you rip me open and burn the whole show</seg><seg type="columnLine">as not. There!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A low whistle was heard. It came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo, and was derisive. Schomberg, breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing heavily, looked on the floor. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">really desperate. Mr. Jones was languidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeptical.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tut, tut! You have a tolerable business.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You are perfectly tame; you--" He paused,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then added in a tone of disgust: "You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wife."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schomberg angrily tapped the floor with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot and uttered an indistinct, laughing curse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What do you mean by flinging that trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my head?" he cried. "I wish you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry her off with you somewhere to the devil!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wouldn't run after you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This unexpected outburst affected Mr. Jones</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely. He had a horrified recoil, chair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, as if Schomberg had thrust a wriggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">viper in his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What's this infernal nonsense?" he mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered thickly. "What do you mean? How</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo chuckled audibly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I tell you I am desperate," Schomberg</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated.

I don't care a hang what happens</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Well, then "--Mr. Jones began to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a quietly threatening effect, as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">147</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">common words of daily use had some other</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly meaning to his mind--" well, then, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should you make yourself ridiculously dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreeable to us? If you don't care, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, you might just as well let us have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"key of that music-shed of yours for a quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">game; a modest bank--a dozen candles or so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would be greatly appreciated by your</seg><seg type="columnLine">clients, as far as I can judge from the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">they bet on a game of ecarte I had with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fair, baby-faced man--what's his name?</seg><seg type="columnLine">They just yearn for a modest bank.

Then he would shudder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull himself together, and creep out, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements strangely inappropriate to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieutenant-of-the-reserve bearing by which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to keep up his self-respect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A great loneliness oppressed him.

He lay awake a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time; and his slumbers, when they camÂ£,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unsatisfactory and short. The morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">light had no joy for his eyes. He listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismally to the movements in the house. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinamen were unlocking and flinging wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doors of the public rooms which opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the veranda. Horrors! Another poisoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">day to get through somehow!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The recollection of his resolve made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel actually sick for a moment. First of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lordly, abandoned attitude of Mr. Jones</seg><seg type="columnLine">disconcerted him. Then there was his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptuous silence. Mr. Jones never addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to Schomberg with any general re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks, never spoke to him unless to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Good morning "--two simple words which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered by that man, seemed a mockery of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening character. And, lastly, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange fear that he inspired. It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a frank, physical fear--for, as to that, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cornered rat will fight--but a superstitious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrinking awe, something like an invincible</seg><seg type="columnLine">repugnance to seek speech with a wicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fact that it was a daylight ghost, sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisingly angular in his attitudes, and for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most part spread out on three chairs, did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it any easier. Daylight only made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a more weird, disturbing, and unlawful ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parition. Strangely enough, in the evening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he came out of his mute supineness, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">unearthly side of him was less obtrusive. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gaming-table, when actually handling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards, it was probably sunk quite out of sight;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Schomberg, having made up his mind in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ostrichlike fashion to ignore what was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, never crossed the threshold of the dese-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crated music-room. He had never seen Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones in the exercise of his vocation--or per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps it was only his trade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I will speak to him to-night," Schomberg</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to himself, while he drank his morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">tea, in pajamas, on the veranda, before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising sun had topped the trees of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">149</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pound, and while the undried dew still lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">silvery on the grass. " That's what I'll do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I won't keep out of sight to-night. I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out and catch him as he goes to bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying the cash-box."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After all, what was the)lellow but a common</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperado? Murderousf Oh, yes; murder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous enough, perhaps -- and the muscles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg's stomach had a quivering con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traction under his airy attire. But even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">common desperado would think twice, or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more likely, a hundred times, before openly</seg><seg type="columnLine">murdering an inoffensive citizen in a civilized,</seg><seg type="columnLine">European-ruled town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shuddered again, and paddled back lo his</seg><seg type="columnLine">room to dress himself. His mind was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and he would think no more about it; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">still he had his doubts. They grew and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded themselves with the progress of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, as some plants do. At times they made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him perspire more than usual, and they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with the possibility of his afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">siesta. After turning over on his couch more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a dozen times, he gave up his attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">repose, got up, and went down-stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was between three and four o'clock, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour of profound peace. The very flowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to doze on their stalks set with sleepy</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves. Not even the air stirred, for the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze was not due till later. The servants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were out of sight, catching naps in the shade</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere behind the house. Mrs. Schom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berg, in a dim up-stairs room with closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">jalousies, was elaborating those two long pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent ringlets which were such a feature of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair-dressing for her afternoon duties. At that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time no customers ever troubled the repose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the establishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wandering about his premises in profound</seg><seg type="columnLine">solitude, Schomberg recoiled at the door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the billiard-room, as if he had seen a snake</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his path. All alone with the billiards, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare little tables, and a lot of untenanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs, Mr. Secretary Ricardo sat near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, performing with lightning rapidity some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that looked like tricks with his own per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal pack of cards, which he always carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">about in his pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schomberg would have backed out quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Ricardo had not turned his head. Having</seg><seg type="columnLine">been seen, the hotel-keeper elected to walk in</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the lesser risk of the two. The conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of his inwardly abject attitude toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">these men caused him always to throw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest out and assume a severe expression.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo watched his approach, clasping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack of cards in both hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You want something, perhaps?" suggested</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg in his lieutenant-of-the-reserve</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo shook his head in silence and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectant. With him Schomberg exchanged at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least twenty words every day. He was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finitely more communicative than his patron.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At times he looked very much like an ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">human being of his class; and he seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in an amiable mood at that moment. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly spreading some ten cards face down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward in the form of a fan, he thrust them</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Schomberg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Come, man, take one quick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schomberg obeyed. Martin Ricardo's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed phosphorescent in the half light of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, screened from the heat and glare of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " That's a king of hearts you've got," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled, showing his teeth in a quick flash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schomberg, after looking at the card, ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted that it was, and slowly laid it down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I can make you take any card I like nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">times out of ten," exulted the secretary, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange curl of his lips and a green flicker in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his raised eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schomberg looked down at him dumbly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a few seconds neither of them stirred;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Ricardo lowered his glance, and, opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers, let the whole pack fall on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schomberg sat down. He sat down because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the faintness in his legs, and for no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason. His mouth was dry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having sat down, he felt that he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak. He squared his shoulders in parade</seg><seg type="columnLine">style.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You are pretty good at that sort of tiling,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Practise makes perfect," replied the secre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary. His precarious amiability made it im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible for Schomberg to get away. . Thus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his very timidity, the hotel-keeper found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself engaged in a conversation the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which had filled him with apprehension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It must be said, in justice to Schomberg,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he concealed his funk very creditably.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The habit of throwing out his chest and speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a severe voice stood him in good stead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With him, too, practise made perfect; and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would probably have kept it up to the end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the very last moment, to the ultimate in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant of breaking strain which would leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him groveling on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To add to his secret trouble, he was at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss what to say.

Dry bank, nice shade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jolly hammocks, fresh fish, good game, every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing lovely. The governor chucked them a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few dollars to begin with; but it was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarding with a pair of savage apes, anyhow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By and by we noticed them talking a lot to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether.

Well, the governor was there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">right enough, lying comfortable on a rug,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he could watch the offing, but I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone back to the hut to get a chew of to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bacco out of my bag.

Perfect gentleman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tell you. I didn't bother him then; but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't likely to forget them two fellows, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">businesslike with their knives. At that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had only one revolver between us two--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the governor's six-shooter, but loaded only in</seg><seg type="columnLine">five chambers; and we had no more cartridges.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had left the box behind in a drawer in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin.

The governor and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on one side, and these two beauties,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross-legged, on the other, grunting a word or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two to each other now and then, hardly hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man speech at all. Presently I began to talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the boss quietly, just as I am talking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you now, careless like, and I told him all I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had observed. He goes on picking up pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fish and putting them into his mouth as</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm as anything.

So</seg><seg type="columnLine">down he pitches, his nose on the red embers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and up jumps our handsome Pedro and I at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time, like two jacks-in-a-box. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">starts to bolt away, with his head over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, and I, hardly knowing what I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing, spring on his back. I had the sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get my hands round his neck at once, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's about all I could do to lock my fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight under his jaw. You saw the beauty's</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, didn't you? Hard as iron, too. Down</seg><seg type="columnLine">we both went.

It wouldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done to let him get away in the dark like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, and have the beauty dodging round in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bushes, perhaps, with the rusty flint-lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun they had. The governor owned up that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jump was the correct thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " ' But he isn't dead,' says he, bending over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Might as well hope to strangle an ox.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We made haste to tie his elbows back, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, before he came to himself, we dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to a small tree, sat him up. and bound him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it, not by the waist, but by the neck--some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> twenty turns of small line round his throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the trunk, finished off with a reef-knot</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his ear.

I fell asleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of a sudden and left him smoking by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire I had made up, his railway rug round his</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, as calm as if he were sitting in a first-</seg><seg type="columnLine">class carriage. We hardly spoke ten words to</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other after it was over, and from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day to this we have never talked of the busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.

I don't know but that even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">real gentleman would find it difficult to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stiff lip to the end.

The drops were pouring over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyebrows, down his beard, off his nose--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he gurgled. Then it struck me that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't see what was in my mind. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to die when it came to it--not in that way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyhow. When I stepped round to get at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashing he let out a sort of soft bellow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thought I was going to stick him from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind, I guess. I cut all the turns with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">slash, and he went over on his side, flop, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started kicking with his tied legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Laugh! I don't know what there was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny about it, but I fairly shouted. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">between my laughing and his wriggling I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a job in cutting him free. As soon as he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel his limbs he makes for the bank, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the governor was standing, crawls up to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his hands and knees, and embraces his legs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gratitude, eh? You could see that being</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed to live suited that chap down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. The governor gets his legs away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him gently and just mutters to me:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " ' Let's be off.

Turned out useful; and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">from gratitude. There was never such grati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude. He will watch and work and fight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">go without sleep, food or drink. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">let himself be chopped into small pieces--with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smile, mind; with a smile--for the gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernor! I don't know about him doing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">much for me; but pretty near, pretty near.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did the tying up and the untying, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see who was the boss. And then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows a gentleman. A dog knows a gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--any dog. It's only some foreigners that</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know--and nothing can teach them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " And you mean to say," asked Schomberg,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disregarding what might have been annoying</seg><seg type="columnLine">for himself in the emphasis of the final re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark, " you mean to say that you left steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">employment at good wages for a life like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There!" began Ricardo quietly. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">just what a man like you would say. I follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gentleman. That ain't the same thing as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve an employer.

Schomberg, preserv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a military stiffness, reenforced by a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown, had allowed his thoughts to stray away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were limning the picture of a young girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">--absent--gone--stolen from him. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rascal looking at him insolently. If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl had not been shamefully decoyed away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him he would not have allowed any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look at him insolently. He would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made nothing of hitting that rogue between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyes. He saw himself doing it; and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathy with this glorious vision his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm moved convulsively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this moment he came out of his sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverie to note with alarm the wide-awake</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity of Mr. Ricardo's stare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " And so you go like this about the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambling," he remarked inanely, to cover his</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion. " Isn't it very precarious?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " No, not so bad," Ricardo said. " It's my</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion that men will gamble as long as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have anything to put on a card. Gamble?</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's nature. What's life itself? You never</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what may turn up. The worst of it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you never erf tell exactly what sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards you are holding yourself. What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">trumps?--that is the question. See? Any man</seg><seg type="columnLine">will gamble if only he's given a chance, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything or everything. You, too--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I haven't touched a card now for twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years," said Schomberg in an austere tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Well, if you got your living that way you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be no worse than you are now, selling</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinks to people--beastly beer and spirits--</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotten stuff, fit to make an old he goat yell if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you poured it down its throat. Pooh! I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand the confounded liquor. Never could.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A whiff of neat brandy in a glass makes me</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel sick. Always did. I've tried to get over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I used to see fellows roll about singing, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the whole world belonged to them. I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold my breath and try to do like the others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But no go! Never could get properly drunk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And next morning -- oh, my word! 'Tain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth it.

You think it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny in a man, don't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schomberg made a vague gesture of tolera-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

Come, Mr. Schom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berg, be hospitable, as the governor says."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schomberg rose and walked with dignity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the counter. He came back carrying a bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">labeled " sirop de groseille " and a pink and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistening tumbler. Mr. Ricardo had followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his movements with oblique, coyly expectant</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow eyes, like a cat watching the prepara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of a saucer of milk; and the satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound after he had drunk might have been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly modified form of purring, very soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deep in his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile Schomberg smoked with moody</seg><seg type="columnLine">composure. Facing him, Ricardo blinked</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly for a time, then closed his eyes alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, with the placidity of the domestic cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozing on the hearth-rug. In another moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">he opened them very wide, and seemed sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised to see Schomberg there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You're having a very slack time to-day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aren't you?" he observed. " But then this</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole town is confoundedly slack, anyhow; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've never faced such a slack party at a table</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. Come eleven o'clock they begin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk of breaking up. What's the matter with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them? Want to go to bed so early, or what?''</seg><seg type="columnLine">" I reckon you don't lose a fortune by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanting to go to bed," said Schomberg with</seg><seg type="columnLine">somber sarcasm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " No," admitted Ricardo with a grin that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched his thin mouth from ear to ear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving a sudden glimpse of his white teeth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Only, you see, when I once start, I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">play for nuts, for parched peas, for any rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bish.

" And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what about you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You talk mighty big," burst out the hotel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper. " You talk of ranging all over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world and doing great things, and taking for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune by the scruff of the neck, but here you</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick at this miserable business!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It isn't much of a lay--that's a fact," ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted Ricardo unexpectedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">158</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUNSEY'S MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schomberg was red in the face with</seg><seg type="columnLine">audacity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I call it paltry," he spluttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's how it looks.

" But if you knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole circumstances you wouldn't get your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in a state with me," he continued easily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, with something of a confidential man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner: " I should be ashamed of it myself, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see the governor is subject to these fits--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fits!" Schomberg cried out, but in a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone. "You don't say so! Fits! That's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious thing, isn't it? You ought to take him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the civil hospital--a lovely place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo nodded slightly with a faint grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Serious enough. Regular fits of laziness, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">call them. Now and then he lays down on me</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this, and there's no moving him. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I like it you're a long way out. I don't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would rather have any crazy notion sprung</seg><seg type="columnLine">on me, as has happened more than once. Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erally speaking, I can talk him over. I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to deal with a gentleman. I am no daily-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bread slave. But when he has said, ' Martin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am bored,' then look out! There's nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do but to shut up--confound it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schomberg had listened, open-mouthed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What's the cause of it?" he asked. " Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">is he like this? I don't understand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I think I do," said Ricardo. " A gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, you know, is not such a simple person as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you or I; and not so easy to manage, either.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I only had something to lever him out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">W'ith!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose noiselessly, stretched himself, sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple and stealthy, glanced out of the corners of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes in the direction of the door, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally leaned back against the table, folding</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms on his breast comfortably, in a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely human attitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " That's another thing you can tell a gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man by--his freakishness.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">governor got like this once in a one-horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican pueblo on the uplands, away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere.

The sound of words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart from the context, has its power; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">these two words, " run off," had a special</seg><seg type="columnLine">affinity to the hotel-keeper's haunting idea.

A three days' jaunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a good boat isn't a thing to frighten people</seg><seg type="columnLine">like us.

He explained that he had a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">plantation, with a fairly habitable hut on it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Madura. He proposed that his guests</seg><seg type="columnLine">should start from town in his boat, as if going</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an excursion to that rural spot. The cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom-house people on the quay were used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see his boat go off on such trips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From Madura, after some repose and on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">convenient day, Mr. Jones and party would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the real start. It would all be plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailing. Schomberg undertook to provision</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat. The greatest hardship the voyagers</seg><seg type="columnLine">need apprehend would be perhaps a mild</seg><seg type="columnLine">shower of rain. At that season of the year</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no serious thunder-storms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under his lieutenant-of-the-reserve exterior</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schomberg's heart began to thump as he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself nearing his vengeance. His speech was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick but persuasive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No risk at all--none whatever!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo dismissed these assurances of safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an impatient gesture. He was thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of other risks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The getting away from here is all right;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we may be sighted at sea, and that may</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring awkwardness later on. A ship's boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with three white men in her, knocking about</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight of land, is bound to make talk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Are we likely to be seen on our way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Only by native craft," said Schomberg.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo nodded, satisfied.

Only the Ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nate mail-boat crossed that region about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">8th of every month, regularly -- nowhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the island, though. Rigid, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse, his heart thumping, his mind concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated on the success of his plan, the hotel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper multiplied words, as if to keep as many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them as possible between himself and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderous aspect of his purpose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">163</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " So, if you gentlemen depart from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">plantation quietly at sunset on the 8th--al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways best to make a start at night, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">land breeze--it's a hundred to one--what am</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	saying?

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms, filling with shadows, seemed haunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">bv a melancholy, uneasy presence which could .</seg><seg type="columnLine">not express itself. The young man got up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with a strange sense of making way for some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing impalpable that claimed possession, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the house and locked the door.

He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly guess that Heyst, alone on the island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt neither more nor less lonely than in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other place, desert or populous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Davidson's concern was, if one may express</seg><seg type="columnLine">it so, the danger of spiritual starvation; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was a spirit which had renounced all out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side nourishment, and was sustaining itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">proudly on its own contempt of the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">coarse aliments which life offers to the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon appetites of men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither was Heyst's body in danger of</seg><seg type="columnLine">starvation, as Schomberg had so confidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">asserted.

It was a curious case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Alfuros, having been frightened by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden invasion of Chinamen, had blocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the path over the ridge by felling a few trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had kept strictly on their own side. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">coolies, as a body, mistrusting the manifest</seg><seg type="columnLine">mildness of these harmless fisherfolk, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept to their lines, without attempting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross the island. Wang was the brilliant ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception. He must have been uncommonly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinating, in a way that was not apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Heyst, or else uncommonly persuasive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The woman's services to Heyst were limited</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fact that she had anchored Wang to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot by her charms, which remained un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to the white man, because she never</seg><seg type="columnLine">came near the houses. The couple lived at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the forest, and she could some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times be seen gazing toward the bungalow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shading her eyes with her hand. Even from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distance she appeared to be a shy. wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature, and Heyst, anxious not to try her</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive nerves unduly, scrupulously avoided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that side of the clearing in his strolls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day--or rather the first night--after</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hermit life began, he was aware of vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds of revelry in that direction. Em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boldened by the departure of the invading</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers, some Alfuros, the woman's friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">and relations, had ventured over the ridge to</seg><seg type="columnLine">166</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUNSEY'S MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">attend something in the nature of a wedding-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feast. Wang had invited them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this was the only occasion when any</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound louder than the buzzing of insects had</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled the profound silence of the clearing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The natives were never invited again. Wang</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only knew how to live according to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventional proprieties, but had strong personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">views as to the manner of arranging his do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mestic existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a time Heyst perceived that Wang</seg><seg type="columnLine">had annexed all the keys. Any key left lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">about vanished after Wang had passed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Subsequently some of them--those that</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not belong to the storerooms and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty bungalows, and could not be regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the common property of this community of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two--were returned to Heyst, tied in a bunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a piece of string. He found them one</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning lying by the side of his plate. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not been inconvenienced by their absence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he never locked up anything in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of drawers and boxes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Heyst said nothing. Wang also said noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Perhaps he had always been a taciturn</seg><seg type="columnLine">man; perhaps he was influenced by the genius</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the locality, which was certainly that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. Till Heyst and Morrison had landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Black Diamond Bay and named it, that side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Samburan had hardly ever heard the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of human speech. It was easy to be taciturn</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Heyst, who had plunged himself into an</seg><seg type="columnLine">abyss of meditation over books, and remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it till the shadow of Wang falling across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the page, and the sound of a rough, low voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttering the Malay word " makan" would</seg><seg type="columnLine">force him to climb out to a meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It is to be presumed that if Wang suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">constraint, he made up for it with the Alfuro</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. He always went back to her at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first fall of dusk,, vanishing from the bunga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low suddenly at his hour, like a sort of topsy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turvy, day-hunting Chinese ghost with a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket and a pigtail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently, giving way to a Chinaman's ruling</seg><seg type="columnLine">passion, he could be observed breaking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground near his hut, between the mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumps of felled trees, with a miner's pickax.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a time, he discovered a rusty but serv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iceable spade in one of the empty storerooms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it is to be supposed that he got on famous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly: but nothing of it could be seen, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went to the trouble of pulling to pieces one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the company's sheds in order to get ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terials for making a high and very close fence</seg><seg type="columnLine">round his patch, as if the growing of vege-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables were an awful and holy mystery en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted to the keeping of his race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst, following from a distance the progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Wang's gardening--there was nothing else</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look at--was amused at the thought that he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his own person, represented the market for</seg><seg type="columnLine">its produce. The Chinaman had found several</seg><seg type="columnLine">packets of seeds in the storerooms, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrendered to an irresistible impulse to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in the ground. He would make his mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter pay for the vegetables that he was raising</seg><seg type="columnLine">to satisfy his instinct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, looking silently at the silent Wang go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about his work in the bungalow in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhasty, steady way, Heyst envied the China-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's obedience to his instincts, the powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">simplicity of purpose which made his exist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence appear almost automatic in the mysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous precision of its facts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XVII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During his master's absence at Sourabaya,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wang had busied himself with the ground im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately in front of the principal bungalow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emerging from the fringe of grass growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the shore end of the coal-jetty, Heyst</seg><seg type="columnLine">beheld a broad, clear space, black and level,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one or two clumps of charred twigs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the flame had swept from the front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his house to the nearest trees of the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You took the risk of firing the grass?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heyst asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wang nodded. Hanging on the arm of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man before whom he stood was the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Alma; but neither from the Chinaman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes nor frtmi his expression could any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">have guessed that he was in the slightest de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gree aware of the fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " He has been tidying the place in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor-saving way," explained Heyst, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at the girl, whose hand rested on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forearm. " He's the whole establishment, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see. I told you I hadn't even a dog to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">me company here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wang had marched off toward the wharf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " He's like those waiters in that place," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.

"We shall find it</seg><seg type="columnLine">useful to have him here. This is the house."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They faced, at some distance, the six</seg><seg type="columnLine">shallow steps leading up to the veranda. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl had abandoned Heyst's arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " This is the house," he repeated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did not offer to budge away from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, but stood staring fixedly at the steps, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they had been something unique and im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">practicable. He waited a little, but she did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">167</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Don't you want to go in?" he asked, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out turning his head to look at her. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's too heavy to stand about here." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to overcome a sort of fear, a sort of im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient faintness, and his voice sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough. " You had better go in," he concluded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They both moved then, but at the foot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stairs Heyst stopped, while the girl went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on rapidly, as if nothing could stop her now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She crossed the veranda swiftly, and entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twilight of the big central room opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it, and then the deeper twilight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room beyond. She stood still in the dusk, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which her dazzled eyes could scarcely make</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the forms of objects, and sighed a sigh of</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief. The impression of sunlight, of sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sky, remained with her like a memory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a painful trial gone through--done with at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile Heyst had walked back slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the jetty; but he did not get so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The practical and automatic Wang had got</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold of one of the little trucks that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">used for running baskets of coal alongside</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships. He appeared, pushing it before him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded lightly with Heyst's bag and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle of the girl's belongings, wrapped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Schomberg's shawl. Heyst turned about</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked by the side of the rusty rails on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the truck ran. Opposite the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wang stopped, lifted the bag to his shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">balanced it carefully, and then took the bundle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Leave those things on the table in the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">room--understand ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Me savee," grunted Wang, moving off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst watched the Chinaman disappear</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the veranda. It was not till he had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wang come out that he himself entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twilight of the big room. By that time Wang</seg><seg type="columnLine">was out of sight at the back of the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but by no means out of hearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chinaman could hear the voice of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, when there were many people there, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">generally referred to as " Number One."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wang was not able to understand the words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the tone interested him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Where are you?" cried Number One.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Wang heard, much more faint, a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had never heard before--a novel impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion which he acknowledged by cocking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head slightly to one side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I am here--out of the sun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The new voice sounded remote and uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain. Wang heard nothing more, though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for some time, very still, the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shaven poll exactly level with the floor of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the back veranda. His face meanwhile pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served an inscrutable immobility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Suddenly he stooped to pick up the lid of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal candle-box which was lying on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his foot. Breaking it up with his fingers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he directed his steps toward the cook-shed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, squatting on his heels, he proceeded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindle a small fire under a very sooty kettle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly to make a cup of tea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wang had some knowledge of the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">superficial rites and ceremonies of white men's</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence, otherwise so enigmatically remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his mind, and containing unexpected possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bilities of good and evil, which had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched for with prudence and care.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That morning, as on all the others of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">full tale of thirty mornings since his return</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the girl to Samburan, Heyst came out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veranda and spread his elbows on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railing, in an easy attitude of proprietorship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The bulk of the central ridge of the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut off the bungalow from sunrises, whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">glorious or cloudy, angry or serene. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwellers therein were debarred from reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">early the fortune of the new-born day. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang upon them in its fulness with a swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreat of the great shadow when the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing the ridge, looked dow-n, hot and dry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a devouring glare like the eye of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy. But Heyst, once the Number One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this locality, while it was comparatively teem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with mankind, appreciated the prolonga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of early coolness, the subdued, lingering</seg><seg type="columnLine">half light, the faint ghost of the departed</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, the fragrance of its dewy, dark soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured for a moment longer between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great glow of the sky and the intense blaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the uncovered sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was naturally difficult for Heyst to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind from dw-elling on the nature and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequences of this, his latest departure from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the part of an unconcerned spectator. Yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had retained enough of his w'recked philosophy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent him from asking himself conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly how it would end. Like the rest of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">who act, all he could say to himself, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat affected grimness, was:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " We shall see!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This mood of grim doubt intruded on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">only when he was alone. There were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">many such moments in his day now; and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not like them when they came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On that morning he had no time to grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasy. Alma came out to join him long be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the sun, rising above the Samburan</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge, swept the cool shadow of the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">168</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUXSEY'S MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">morning clear off the roof under which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dwelt for more than thirty days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She came out as on other mornings. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had heard her light footsteps in the big room</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--the room where he had unpacked the cases</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from London--the room now lined with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">backs of books half-way up on its three sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Above the cases the fine matting met the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ceiling of tightly stretched white calico. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the dusk and coolness nothing gleamed except</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the gilt frame of the portrait of Heyst's fa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ther, signed by a famous painter, lonely in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the middle of a wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Heyst did not trrn round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" Do you know what I was thinking of?" he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" No," she said.

"What was it?" She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">waited. Then, rather with reluctance than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shyness, she asked: "Were you thinking of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" I was wondering when you were coming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out." said Heyst, still without looking at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">girl--to whom, after several experimental es-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">says in combining detached letters and loose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">syllables, he had given the name of Lena.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She remarked after a pause:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" I was not very far from you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" Apparently you were not near enough for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" \ ou could have called me," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" And I wasn't so long doing my hair."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" Apparently it was too long for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" Well, you were thinking of me, anyhow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I am glad of it.

She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">often said things which surprised him. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vague smile faded away on her lips before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his scrutiny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What is it?" he asked. "Is it a re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">proach?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"A reproach! Why, how could it be?" she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">defended herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" Well, what did it mean?" he insisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" Wrhat I said--just what I said.

"That I won't! I can only</seg><seg type="columnLine">be what you think I am."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made a slight movement. She put her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on his arm, without raising her head, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on, her voice animated in the stillness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her body:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " It is so.

The indefinable</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion which certain intonations gave him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was aware, was more physical than moral.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every time she spoke to him she seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandon to him something of herself--some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing excessively subtle and inexpressible, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he was infinitely sensible, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have missed horribly if she were to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While he was looking into her eyes she</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised her bare forearm out of its short</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeve and held it in the air till he noticed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hastened to pose his great bronze mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tache on the whiteness of the skin. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">they went in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Wang immediately appeared in front, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatting on his heels, began to potter mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teriously about some plants at the foot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda. When Heyst and the girl came out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, the Chinaman had gone in his peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner, which suggested vanishing out of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istence rather than out of sight, a process of</seg><seg type="columnLine">evaporation rather than of movement. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended the steps, looking at each other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">169</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and started off smartly across the cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground; but they were, not ten yards away</seg><seg type="columnLine">when, without perceptible stir or sound, Wang</seg><seg type="columnLine">materialized inside the empty room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Chinaman stood still with roaming eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">examining the walls as if for signs, for in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scriptions; exploring the floor as if for pitfalls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for dropped coins. Then he cocked his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly at the profile of Heyst's father, pen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand above a white sheet of paper on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson table-cloth; and, moving forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiselessly, began to clear away the breakfast</seg><seg type="columnLine">things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Though he proceeded without haste, the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erring precision of his movements, the abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lute soundlessness of the operation, gave it</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of the quality of a conjuring trick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, the trick having been performed, Wang</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished from the scene, to materialize pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently in front of the house. He materialized</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking away from it, with no visible or guess-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able intention; but at the end of some ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">paces he stopped, made a half turn, and put</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand up to shade his eyes. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The sun had topped the gray ridge of Sam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">buran. The great morning shadow was gone;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and far away in the devouring sunshine Wang</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in time to see Number One and the wom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">an, two remote white specks against the somber</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of the forest. In a moment they vanished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the smallest display of action, Wang also</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished from the sunlight of the clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Heyst and Lena entered the shade of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest path which crossed the island, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, near its highest point, had been blocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by felled trees. But their intention was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go so far. After keeping to the path for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some distance, they left it at a point where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest was bare of undergrowth, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiees, festooned with creepers, stood clear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another in the gloom of their own ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king. Here and there great splashes of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay on the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They moved, silent in the great stillness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing the calmness, the infinite isolation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the repose of a slumber without dreams. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged at the upper limit of vegetation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">among some rocks; and in a depression of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp slope, like a small platform, they turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">about and looked from on high over the sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely, its color effaced by sunshine, its hori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zon a heat mist, a mere unsubstantial shim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer in the pale and blinding infinity overhung</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the darker blaze of the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " It makes my head swim," the girl mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, shutting her eyes and putting her hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Heyst, gazing to the southward, exclaimed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     " Sail ho!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    A moment of silence ensued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    " It must be very far away," he went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" I don't think you could see it.

The peculiar timbre of her voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its modulations of audacity and sadness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have given interest to the most inane</seg><seg type="columnLine">chatter. But she was no chatterer. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather silent, with a capacity for immobility,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an upright stillness, as when resting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">concert platform between the musical num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers, her feet crossed, her hands reposing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even in the intimacy of their life her</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray, unabashed gaze forced upon him the' sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation of something inexplicable reposing with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her; stupidity or inspiration, weakness or</seg><seg type="columnLine">force--or simply an abysmal emptiness, reserv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing itself even in the moments of complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrender.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During a long pause she did not look at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, suddenly, as if the word " deluge " had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck in her mind, she asked, looking up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cloudless sky:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Does it ever rain here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " There is a season when it rains almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">every day," said Heyst, surprised.

A thought seemed to occur to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He turned his face to the girl.

His sight plunged straight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the stern-sheets of a big boat, the greater</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">part of which was hidden from him by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">planking of the jetty. His eyes fell on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thin back of a man doubled up over the tiller</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a queer, uncomfortable attitude of droop-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing sorrow. Another man, more directly be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">low Heyst, sprawled on his back from gun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wale to gunwale, half off the after thwart, his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">head lower than his feet. This second man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glared wildly upward, struggled to raise him-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">self, but to all appearances was much too</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drunk to succeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The visible part of the boat contained also</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a flat, leather trunk, on which the first man's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long legs were nervelessly tucked up. A large</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earthenware jar, with its wide mouth un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">corked. rolled out on the bottom boards from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">under the sprawling man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Heyst had never been so much astonished</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in his life. He stared in dumb wonder at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strange boat s crew. From the first he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">positive that these men were not sailors. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wore the white drill suit of tropical civiliza-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion; but their apparition in a boat Heyst</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could not connect with anything plausible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The civilization of the tropics could have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had nothing to do with it. It was more like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the myths, current in Polynesia, of amazing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strangers who arrive at an island, gods or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">demons, bringing good or evil to the inno-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cence of the inhabitants -- gifts of unknown</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">things, wrords never heard before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Heyst noticed a cork helmet floating along-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side the boat, evidently fallen from the head</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the man doubled over the tiller, who dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">181</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">played a dark, bony poll. An oar, too, had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been knocked overboard, probably by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sprawling man, who was still struggling be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tween the thwarts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  By this time Heyst regarded the visitation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no longer with surprise, but with the sus-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tained attention demanded by a difficult prob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lem. With one foot posed on the string-piece,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and leaning on his raised knee, he instinctively</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">abstained from speaking. His quiet gaze was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taking in everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The sprawling man rolled off the thwart,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">collapsed, and, most unexpectedly, got on his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feet. He swayed dizzily, spreading his arms</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out, and uttered faintly a hoarse, as if dreamv,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hello!''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   His upturned face was swollen, red, peeling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all over the nose and cheeks. His stare was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">irrational. Heyst perceived stains of dried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blood all over the front of his dirty white</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">coat, and also on one sleeve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What's the matter? Are you wounded?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The other glanced down, reeled--one of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feet was inside a large pith hat--and, recover-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing himself, let out a dismal, grating sound in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the manner of a laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Blood--not mine. Thirst's the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Exhausted's the matter. Done up. Water,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man! Give us water!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Thirst was in the very tone of his words,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alternating a broken croak and a faint, throaty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rustle which just reached Heyst's ears. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man in the boat raised his hands to be helped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up on the jetty, whispering:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I tried. I am too weak. I tumbled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Wang was coming along the jetty slowly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with intent, straining eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Run back and bring a crowbar here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There's one lying by the coal-heap," Heyst</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shouted to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The man standing in the boat sat down on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the thwart behind him. A horrible coughing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">laugh came through his swollen lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Crowbar? What's that for?" he mum-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bled, and suddenly his head dropped on his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Meantime Heyst, as if he had forgotten</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the boat, was busy kicking hard at a large</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brass tap projecting above the planks. To</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">accommodate ships that came for coal and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">happened to need water as well, a stream had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been tapped in the interior and an iron pipe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">led along the jetty. It terminated with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">curved end almost exactly wffere the strangers'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">boat had been driven between the piles; but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the tap was set fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hurry up!" Heyst yelled to the China-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man, who was running with the crowbar in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Heyst snatched it from him, and, obtaining</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a leverage against the string-piece, wrung the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stiff tap round with a mighty jerk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   " If only that pipe hasn't got choked!" he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">muttered to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    It hadn t; but it did not yield a strong gush,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as he expected. The sound of a thin stream,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">partly breaking on the gunwale of the boat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and partly splashing alongside, became at once</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">audible. It provoked a cry of inarticulate and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">savage joy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Heyst knelt on the string-piece and peered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down. The man who had spoken w'as already</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">holding his open mouth under the bright</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trickle. His face, with closed eyes, had an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">air of ecstasy. Water ran over his eyelids and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over his nose, gurgled down his throat, flowed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over his chin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Then some obstruction in the pipe gave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way, and a sudden, thick jet broke on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In a moment his shoulders were soaked, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">front of his coat inundated; he streamed and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dripped; water ran into his pockets, down his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">legs, into his shoes; but he had clutched the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">end of the pipe, and, hanging on with both</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hands, swallowed, spluttered, choked, snorted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the noises of a swimmer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Suddenly a curious dull roar reached Heyst's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ears. Something hairy and black flew from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">under the jetty. A disheveled head, coming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on like a cannon-ball, took the man at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pipe in flank with such force as to tear his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grip loose and fling him headlong into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stern-sheets. He fell upon the folded legs of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the man at the tiller, who, roused by the com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">motion in the boat, was sitting up, silent,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rigid, and very much like a corpse. His eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were but two black patches, and his teeth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glistened with a death's-head grin between his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">retracted lips, which were no thicker than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blackish parchment glued over his gums.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">From him Heyst's eyes wandered to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">creature who had replaced the first man at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">end oi the water-pipe. Enormous brown paws</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clutched it desperately; the wild, big head</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hung back, and in a face covered with a wet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mass of hair there gaped crookedly a wide</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mouth full of fangs. The water filled it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">welled up in hoarse coughs, ran down on each</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side of the jaws and down the hairy throat,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soaked the black pelt of the enormous chest,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which was naked under a torn check shirt,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and which heaved convulsively with a play of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">massive muscles carved in red mahogany.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As soon as the second man had recovered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the breath knocked out of him by the apelike</seg><seg type="columnLine">182</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUNSEY'S MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">monster's irresistible charge, a scream of mad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cursing issued from the stern-sheets. With a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rigid, angular crooking of the elbow the man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the tiller put his hand back to his hip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't shoot him, Mr. Jones!" yelled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second man. " Wait! Let me have that tiller.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will teach him to shove himself in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a caballero!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Martin Ricardo flourished the heavy piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wood, leaped forward with astonishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigor, and brought it down on Pedro's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a crash that resounded all over the quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweep of Black Diamond Bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A crimson patch appeared on the matted</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair; red veins appeared in the water flowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over his face, and it dripped in rosy drops</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his head. But the man hung on. Not till</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second furious blow descended did the hairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">paws let go their grip and the squirming body</seg><seg type="columnLine">sink limply. Before it could touch the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">boards a tremendous kick in the ribs from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo's foot shifted it forward out of sight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whence came the noise of a heavy thud, a clat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of spars, and a pitiful grunt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo stooped to look under the jetty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aha, dog! That will teach you to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">back where you belong, you murdering brute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you slaughtering savage, you! You infidel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you robl^er of churches! Next time I will rip</seg><seg type="columnLine">you open from neck to heel, you carrion-eater!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esclavol"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He straightened himself up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I don't mean it really," he remarked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heyst, whose steady eyes met his from above.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He ran aft briskly. " Come along, sir. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">your turn. I oughtn't to have drunk first. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth, I forgot myself! A gentleman like you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will overlook that, I know." As he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">these apologies Ricardo extended his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Let me steady you, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly Mr. Jones unfolded himself in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his slenderness, rocked, staggered, and caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo's shoulder. IJis henchman assisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to the pipe, which went on gushing a clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of water, sparkling exceedingly against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black piles and the gloom under the jetty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Catch hold, sir," Ricardo advised so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">licitously. "All right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped back, and, while Mr. Jones</seg><seg type="columnLine">reveled in the abundance of water, he ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed himself to Heyst with a sort of justi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficatory speech, the tone of which, reflecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feelings, partook of purring and spitting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wanted to be propitiatory, but he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not help his native ferocity piercing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diplomatic envelope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had been thirty hours pulling that</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute of a boat, he explained, and they had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been more than forty hours without a drop of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. No, that was not exact. The night</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they had had the felicity of licking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dew off the gunwales.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo did not explain to Heyst how it</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. At that precise moment he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no explanation ready for the man on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wharf, who, he guessed, must be wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more at the presence of his visitors than</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their plight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XXII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The explanation lay in these two simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts--that the light winds and strong currents</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Java Sea had drifted the boat about</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they partly lost their bearings; and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some extraordinary mistake one of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">jars put into the boat by Schomberg's man</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained salt water. But of all this, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursting with rage against the hotel-keeper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo could not speak. Only his eyes flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury now and then as he tried to put some</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathos into his tones while enlarging on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">party's sufferings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pulling for thirty hours with eighteen-foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">oars! And the sun! Ricardo relieved his feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings by cursing the sun. They had felt their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts and lungs shrivel within them. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, as if all that hadn't been trouble enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he complained bitterly, he had had to waste</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fainting strength by beating their servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the head with a stretcher. The fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to drink salt water and wouldn't listen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reason. There was no stopping him other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise. It was better to beat him into insensi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility than to have him go crazy in the boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and be obliged to shoot him. The prevent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ive, administered with enough force to brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">an elephant, boasted Ricardo, had to be ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied on two occasions--the second time all</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in sight of the jetty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You have seen the beauty," Ricardo went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on expansively, hiding his lack of some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable story under this loquacity. " I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hammer him again from the spout--to open</seg><seg type="columnLine">afresh all the old, broken spots on his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You saw how hard I had to hit. He has no</seg><seg type="columnLine">restraint, no restraint at all. If it wasn't that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he can be made useful in one way or another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would just as soon have let the governor</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled up at Heyst in his peculiar lip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">retracting manner, and added by way of after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " That's what will happen to him in the end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he doesn't learn to restrain himself. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've taught him to mind his manners for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while, anyhow!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">183</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And again he addressed his quick grin up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man on the wharf. His round eyes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never left Heyst's face since he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliver his account of the voyage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " So that's how he looks!" Ricardo was say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had not expected Heyst to be like this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had formed for himself a conception con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining the helpful suggestion of a vulnerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">point. These solitary men were often tipplers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But no--this was not a drinking man's face;</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor could he detect the weakness of alarm, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the weakness of surprise, on these fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, in these steady eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " We were too far gone to climb out,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo wrent on. " I heard you walking along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though. I thought I shouted; I tried to. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't hear me shout?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst made an almost imperceptible nega-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive sign, which the greedy eyes of Ricardo--</seg><seg type="columnLine">greedy for all signs--did not miss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Throat too parched. We didn't even care</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whisper to each other lately. Thirst chokes</seg><seg type="columnLine">one.

Drunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">--ha, ha! Too dry, by George! We fetched</seg><seg type="columnLine">in here with the very last of our strength, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no mistake. Another mile would have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us. When I heard your footsteps above I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to get up and I fell down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " That was the first sound I heard," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heyst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Jones, the front of his soiled white</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunic soaked and plastered against his breast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone, staggered away from the water-pipe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steadying himself on Ricardo's shoulder, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew a long breath, raised his dripping head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and produced a smile of ghastly amiability,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was lost upon the thoughtful Heyst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind his back the sun, touching the water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like a small disk of iron cooled to a dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">red glow, ready to start rolling round the cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cular steel plate of the sea, which, under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkening sky, looked more solid than the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge of Samburan; more solid than the point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose long, outlined slope melted into its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfathomable shadow, blurring the dim sheen</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The forceful stream from the pipe broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">like shattered glass on the boat's gunwale.

The vague apprehension of a distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">future, in which he saw Lena unavoidably sep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arated from him by profound and subtle dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferences, was now replaced by the immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">concern of responsibility for the girl's safety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That skeptical carelessness which had accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied every one of his attempts at action,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a secret reserve of his soul, fell away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him.

He glanced along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda in the direction of the other bunga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. The fire of sticks in front of it had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. No faint glow of embers, not the slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est thread of light in that direction hinted at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of strangers.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so visibly surprised that he hastened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">add: " Of course, there is some money in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house--there, in that writing-desk, the drawer</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the leit. It s not locked. You can pull it</seg><seg type="columnLine">right out. There is a recess, and the board at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back pivots; a very simple hiding-place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you know the way to it. I discovered it</seg><seg type="columnLine">bv accident, and I keep our store of sovereigns</seg><seg type="columnLine">in there. The treasure, my dear, is not big</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to require a cavern!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He paused, laughed very low, and returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">her steady stare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " The loose silver, some guilders and dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars, I have always kept in that unlocked left</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawer.

She only gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him one of her deep-gleaming smiles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " It isn't me, so it must be Wang. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to make him give it back to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Heyst said nothing to that naive and prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical suggestion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XXV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The object that Heyst missed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawer w'as his revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a heavy weapon which he had owned</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many years and had never used in his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ever since the London furniture had arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Samburan it had been reposing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawer of the table. The real dangers of life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him, were not those which could be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled by swords or bullets. On the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, neither his manner nor his appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">100</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUNSEY'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looked sufficiently inoffensive to expose him to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">light-minded aggression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could not have explained what had in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced him to go to the drawer in the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the night. He had started up suddenly--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was very unusual with him. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself sitting up and extremely wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake all at once, with the girl reposing by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side, lying with her face away from him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vague, characteristically feminine form in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dim light. She was perfectly still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that season of the year there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosquitoes in Samburan, and the sides of "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosquito-net were looped up. Heyst swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet to the floor, and found himself stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing there, almost before he had become aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his intention to get up. Why he did this he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know. He didn't wish to wake her</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and the slight creak of the broad bedstead</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sounded very loud to him. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">round apprehensively and wailed for her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move; but she did not stir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While he looked at her he had a vision of</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself lying there too, also fast asleep, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">--it occurred to him for the first time in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life--very defenseless. This quite novel im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of the dangers of slumber made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">think suddenly of his revolver. He left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedroom with noiseless footsteps. The light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the curtain he had to lift as he passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and the outer door, wide open on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness of the veranda--for the roof eaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down low, shutting out the starlight--</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him a sense of having been dangerously</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed, he could not have said to what.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pulled the drawer open. Its emptiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut his train of self-communion short. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured to the assertive fact:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Impossible! Somewhere else!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried to remember where he had put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing; but those provoked whispers of memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not encouraging. Foraging in every re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptacle and nook big enough to contain a</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver he came to the conclusion that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in that room. Neither was it in the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole bungalow consisted of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms and a profuse allowance of veranda all</seg><seg type="columnLine">round. Heyst stepped out on the veranda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It's Wang, beyond a doubt," he thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring into the night. "He has got hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for some reason."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing to prevent that ghostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinaman from materializing suddenly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of the stairs, or anywhere, at any mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and toppling him over with a dead-sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot. The danger was so irremediable that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not worth worrying about, any more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the general precariousness of human life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst speculated on this added risk. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">long had he been at the mercy of a slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow finger on the trigger? That is, if that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the fellow's reason for purloining the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Shoot and inherit," thought Heyst. " Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet there was in his mind a marked re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luctance to regard the domesticated grower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetables in the light of a murderer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " No, it wasn't that. For Wang could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done it any time these last twelve months or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst's mind had worked on the assumption</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Wang had possessed himself of the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver during his own absence from Sam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">buran: but at that period of his speculation</seg><seg type="columnLine">his point of view changed. It struck him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the force of manifest certitude that the revol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver had been taken only late in the day, or on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that very night. Wang, of course! But why?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So there had been no danger in the past.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has me at his mercy now!" thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heyst, without particular excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sentiment he experienced was curiosity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He forgot himself in it; it was as if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">considering somebody else's strange predica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. But even that sort of interest was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying out when, looking at his left, he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed shapes of the other bungalows</seg><seg type="columnLine">looming in the night, and remembered the ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rival of the thirsty company in the boat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wang would hardly risk such a crime in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of other white men. It was a pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culiar instance of the "safety in numbers"</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle, which somehow was not much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heyst's taste.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went in gloomily and stood over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty drawer in deep and unsatisfactory</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. He had just made up his mind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must breathe nothing of this to the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he heard her voice behind him. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken him by surprise, but he resisted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse to turn round under the impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she might read his trouble in his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, she had taken him by surprise; and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reason the conversation which began was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not exactly as he would have conducted it if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been prepared for her pointblank ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. He ought to have said at once: " I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed nothing." It was a deplorable thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, he should have let it come so far as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have her ask what it was he missed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He closed the conversation by saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It's an object of very small value. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry about it--it isn't worth while. The best</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">191</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you can do is to go and lie down again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lena."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reluctantly she turned away, and only in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway asked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " And you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. " I think I shall smoke a cheroot on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda.

She saw him standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, very still, with a frown on his brow, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly dropped the curtain*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst did really light a cheroot before going</seg><seg type="columnLine">out again on the veranda. He glanced up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the low eaves, to see by the stars how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night went on. It was going very slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why it should have irked him he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know; for he had nothing to expect from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn; but everything round him had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">unreasonable, unsettled, and vaguely urgent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laying him under an obligation, but giving him</seg><seg type="columnLine">no line of action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt contemptuously irritated with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation. The outer world had broken upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; and he did not know what wrong he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done to bring this on himself, any more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew what he had done to provoke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible calumny about his treatment of poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morrison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For he could not forget this. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the ears of one who needed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most perfect confidence in the authority</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his conduct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " And she only half disbelieves it," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, with hopeless humiliation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This moral stab in the back seemed to Rave</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken some of his strength from him, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical wound would have done. He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to do anything--neither to bring Wang</seg><seg type="columnLine">to terms in the matter of the revolver, nor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out from the strangers who they were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and how their predicament had come about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He flung his glowing cigar away into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. But Samburan was no longer a soli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude wherein he could indulge all his moods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fiery, parabolic trail the cast-out stump</seg><seg type="columnLine">traced in the air was seen from another veran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">da at a distance of some twenty yards. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was noted as a symptom of importance by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">observer with his faculties greedy for signs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a state of alertness tense enough al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most to hear the grass grow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XXVI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The observer was Martin Ricardo. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">him life was not a matter of passive renuncia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, but of a particularly active warfare. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not mistrustful of it, he was not dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gusted with it, still less was he inclined to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious of its disenchantments; but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">vividly aware that it held many possibilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of failure. Though very far from being a pes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">simist, he was not a man of foolish illusions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not like failure; not only because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its unpleasant and dangerous consequences,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but also because of its damaging effect upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own appreciation of Martin Ricardo. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was a special job, of his own contriving,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of considerable novelty. It was not, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak, in his usual line of business--except,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, from a moral standpoint, about which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not likely to trouble his head. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">these reasons Martin Ricardo was unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Jones, after repeated shivering fits, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after drinking much hot tea, had apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen into deep slumber. He had very per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">emptorily discouraged attempts at conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion on the part of his faithful follower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo listened to his regular breathing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all very well for the governor. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked upon it as a sort of sport. A gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man naturally would. But this ticklish and</seg><seg type="columnLine">important .job had to be pulled off at all costs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both for honor and for safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo arose quietly, and made his way on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veranda. He could not lie still. He want-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to go out for air; and he had a feeling that</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the force of his eagerness even the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and the silence could be made to yield</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to his eyes and ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He noted the stars, and stepped back again</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the dense darkness. It comforted him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was impenetrable. He was hidden in it as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if in ambush. He stood erect against the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">confident that no one in the open could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was there. He strained his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears, but the darkness and the silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">would give no sign.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He resisted the growing impulse to go out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and steal toward the other bungalow. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been madness to go prowling in the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">on unknown ground. And for what end? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept his objectless vigil, though convinced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would neither hear nor see anything. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of the island was keeping quiet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at that moment that Ricardo's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the vanishing red trail of light made</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the cigar -- a startling revelation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other man's wakefulness. He could not sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press a low " Hello!" and began to sidle along</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the door, with his shoulders rubbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall. For all he knew, the other man</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been out in front by this time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">observing the veranda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a matter of fact, after flinging away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheroot, Heyst had gone in with the feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">192</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUNSEY'S MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man who gives up an unprofitable occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pation. But Ricardo fancied he could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint footfalls on the open ground. Being</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the door, he quietly dodged into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. There he drew breath, and meditated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dark for a while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His next step was to feel for the matches</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the tall desk, and to light the candle. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to communicate to his governor views and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflections of such importance that it was ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely necessary for him to watch their</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect on the very countenance of the hearer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first he had thought that these matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have waited till daylight; but the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's wakefulness, disclosed in that startling</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, made him feel suddenly certain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there could be no sleep for him that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said as much to his governor. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little daggerlike flame had done its best to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispel the darkness, Mr. Jones was dimly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen reposing on a camp bedstead, in a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant part of the room. A railway rug con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealed his spare form up to his very head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which lay on the other railway rug rolled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a pillow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo plumped himself down cross-legged</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor, very close to the low bedstead;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that Mr. Jones--who perhaps had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so very profoundly asleep--on opening his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">found them conveniently leveled at the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his secretary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh? What is it you say? No sleep for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to-night? But why can't you let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep? Confound your fussiness!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Because that there fellow can't sleep--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's why. Dash me if he hasn't been doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a think just now! What business has he to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think in the middle of the night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Howr do you know?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " He was out, sir--up in the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. My own eyes saw it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " But how do you know that he was up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think?" inquired Mr. Jones. "It might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been anything--toothache, for instance. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you may have dreamed it for all I know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Didn't you try to sleep?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " No, sir. I didn't even try to go to sleep."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo informed his patron of his vigil on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veranda, and of the revelation which put</seg><seg type="columnLine">an end to it. He concluded that a man up</seg><seg type="columnLine">wjth a cigar in the middle of the night must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be doing a think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Jones had raised himself on his elbow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This sign of interest comforted his faithful</seg><seg type="columnLine">henchman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Seems to me it's time we did a little think</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves." added Ricardo, with more as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You are always making a fuss," remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Jones in a tolerant tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Aye, but not for nothing, am I? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't say that, sir. Mine may not be a gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's way of looking round a thing, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't a fool's way, either. You've admitted-</seg><seg type="columnLine">that much yourself at odd times."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo was growing warmly argumenta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive. Mr. Jones interrupted him without heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You haven't roused me to talk about</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself, I presume."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " No, sir." Ricardo remained silent for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute, with the tip of his tongue peeping be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween his lips. " I don't think I could tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you anything about myself that you don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know," he continued. There was a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">amused satisfaction in his tone which changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely as he went on.

He admit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted, however, that the man might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasy at the arrival of strangers, because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that plunder of his put away somewhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">193</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo glanced here and there, as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were afraid of being overheard by the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows that the dim light cast all over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.

It's the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">way them tame ones--the common 'yporcrites</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world--get on.

I feel all limp yet; but never</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind--his swag will pay for the lot!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " He's all alone here," remarked Mr. Jones</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hollow murmur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Ye-es, in a way.

Finally he concluded</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wouldn't. The enterprise was difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enough without complicating it with an upset</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sensibilities of the gentleman with</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he had the honor of being associated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let the discovery come of itself, he thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he could swear that he had known</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of that offensive presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not need to lie. He had only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold his tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yes," he muttered reflectively, " there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">that chink, certainly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At bottom he felt a certain ambiguous</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect for his governor's exaggerated dislike</seg><seg type="columnLine">of women. He did not pretend to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. All he knew was that he himself was dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferently inclined, and that it did not make</seg><seg type="columnLine">him any happier or safer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Foreseeing many difficulties of a material</seg><seg type="columnLine">order, Mr. Jones's henchman decided to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl out of the governor's knowledge; out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his sight, too, for as long a time as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be managed. That, alas, seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">at most a matter of a few hours; whereas</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo feared that to get the affair properly</seg><seg type="columnLine">going would take some time. Once well start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, he was not afraid of his gentleman failing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. As is often the case with lawless na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, Ricardo's faith in any given individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of a simple, unquestioning character. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">man must have some support in life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cross-legged, his head drooping a little and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly still, he might have been meditating</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a bronzelike attitude upon the sacred syl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lable " Om." It was a striking illustration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the untruth of appearances, for his contempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the world was of a severely practical kind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing Oriental about Ricardo but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amazing quietness of his pose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Jones was also very quiet. He had let</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head sink on the rolled-up rug, and lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched out on his side with his back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. In that position the shadows gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cavities of his eyes made them look</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly empty. When he spoke, his ghostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice had only to travel a few inches straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Ricardo's left ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Why don't you say something, now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've got me awake?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I wonder if you were sleeping as sound as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are trying to make out, sir," said the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved Ricardo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I wonder," repeated Mr. Jones. " At any</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate, I was resting quietly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, sir!"

He ain't a rabbit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course. You couldn't hyptonize him, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw you do to more than one dago, and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">kinds of tame citizens, when it came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of holding them down to a game."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Don't you reckon on that," murmured</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain Mr. Jones seriously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir, I don't; though you have a won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful power of the eye.

At any rate, let us think</seg><seg type="columnLine">so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A weariness with the monotony of life was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected in the tone of this qualified assent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It jarred on the nerves of the sanguine Ri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cardo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Let us think of the way to go to work,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he retorted a little impatiently. " He's a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. Just look at the way he treated that</seg><seg type="columnLine">chum of his. Did you ever hear of anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">so low? And the artfulness of the beast--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dirty, tame artfulness!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Don't you start moralizing, Martin," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Jones warningly. " As far as I can make</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the story that German hotel-keeper told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, it seems to show a certain amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">character; an independence from common</seg><seg type="columnLine">feelings which is not usual.

Jones's calm whisper</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept into his ear. " Come to the point."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Obedient, the secretary shook off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfulness. There was a similarity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind between these two--one the outcast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his vices, the other inspired by a spirit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scornful defiance, the aggressiveness of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast of prey looking upon all the tame crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of the earth as its natural victims. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">were astute enough, however, and both were</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that they had plunged into this adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture without a sufficient scrutiny of detail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The feeling voiced by the henchman in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own way--" We don't seem much forwarder</seg><seg type="columnLine">now we are here "--was acknowledged by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence of the patron. It was easy enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rip a fellow up or drill a hole in him. whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was alone or not, Ricardo reflected in low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidential tones, but--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " He isn't alone," Mr. Jones said faintly, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attitude of a man composed for sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Don't forget that Chinaman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo started slightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, aye--the chink!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo had been on the point of confessing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the girl; but no!

The ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial vision of the spoil absorbed all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">faculties. A great vision! He seemed to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. A few small canvas bags tied up with thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord, their distended rotundity showing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside pressure of the disklike forms of coins</seg><seg type="columnLine">--gold, solid, heavy, eminently portable. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps steel cash-boxes with a chased design on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the covers; or perhaps a black and brass box</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a handle on the top, and full of goodness</seg><seg type="columnLine">know's what. Bank-notes? Why.not? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lellow' had been going home; so it was surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">something worth going home with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " And he may have put it anyw'here outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">--anywhere!" cried Ricardo in a deadened</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. " In the forest--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was it! A temporary darkness re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed the dim light of the room. The dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the forest at night, and in it the gleam</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a lantern, by which a figure is digging at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foot of a tree-trunk. As likely as not an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other figure holding that lantern--ha, femi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine! The girl!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The prudent Ricardo stifled a picturesque</seg><seg type="columnLine">and profane exclamation, partly joy, partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismay. Had the girl been trusted or mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted by that man? Whatever it was, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound to be wholly! With women there</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be no half-measures. He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine a fellow half-trusting a woman in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">relation to himself, and in those particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances' of conquest and loneliness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In nine cases out of ten the woman would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be trusted. But, trusted or mistrusted, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">her presence a favorable or unfavorable con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition of the problem? That was the question!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The temptation to consult his chief, to talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the weighty fact and get his opinion on</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, was great indeed. Ricardo resisted it; but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the agony of his solitary mental conflict wa3</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely sharp. A woman in a problem is</seg><seg type="columnLine">an incalculable quantity, even if you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to go upon in forming your guess.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How much more so when you haven't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">once caught sight of her!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Swift as were his mental processes, he felt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that a longer silence was inadvisable. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hastened to speak:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " And do you see, sir, you and I, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of spades having to tackle this whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">confounded island?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He allowed himself a slight movement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arm.

Al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ready the sparkle of open sea was encroaching</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rapidly on the dark, cool, early-morning blue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Black Diamond Bay; but the deep gloom</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lingered yet under the mighty pillars of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">forest, between which the secretary dodged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was watching Number One's bungalow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with an animal-like patience, if with a very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">human complexity of purpose. This was the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">second morning of such watching. The first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one had not been rewarded by success. Well,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strictly speaking, there was no hurry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The sun, swinging above the ridge, all at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">once inundated with light the space of burned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grass in front of Ricardo and the face of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bungalow, on which his eyes were fixed, leav-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing only the one dark spot of the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">To his right, to his left, and behind him,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">splashes of gold appeared in the deep shade</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the forest, thinning the gloom under the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ragged roof of leaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This was not a very favorable circumstance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for Ricardo's purpose. He did not wish to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">detected in his patient occupation. For what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he was watching for was a sight of the girl--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that girl! Just a glimpse across the burned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">patch to see what she was like.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   He had excellent eyes, and the distance was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not so great. He would be able to distinguish</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her lace quite easily if she only came out on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the veranda; and she was bound to do that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sooner or later. He was confident that he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could form some opinion about her--which,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he felt, was very necessary, before venturing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on some steps to get in touch with her be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hind that Swedish baron's back. She couldn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be much. He knew that sort!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  By protruding his head a little he com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">manded, through the foliage of a festooning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">creeper, a view of the three bungalows, ir-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">regularly disposed along a flat curve. Over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the veranda rail of the farthermost one hung</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a dark rug of a tartan pattern, amazingly con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spicuous. Ricardo could see the very checks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A brisk fire of sticks was burning on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ground in front of the steps, and in the sun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">light the thin, fluttering flame had paled al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">most to invisibility--a mere rosy stir under</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a faint wreath of smoke. He could see the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white bandage on the head of Pedro bending</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over it, and the wisps of black hair sticking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up weirdly. He had wound that bandage him-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">self, after breaking that shaggy and enormous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">head. The creature balanced it like a load,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">staggering toward the steps. Ricardo could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">see a small, long-handled saucepan at the end</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of a great, hairy paw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Yes, he could see all that there was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">198</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUNSEY'S MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seen, far and near. Excellent eyes! The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing they could not penetrate was the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblong of the doorway on the veranda under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the low eaves of the bungalow's roof. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was vexing. It was an outrage. Ricardo</seg><seg type="columnLine">was easily outraged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surely she would come out presently! Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't she? Surely the fellow did not tie her</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the bed-post before leaving the house!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing appeared. Ricardo was as still as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leafy cables of creepers depending in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">convenient curtain from the mighty limb sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet above his head. His very eyelids were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, and this unblinking watchfulness gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the dreamy air of a cat posed on a hearth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rug, contemplating the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was he dreaming? There, in plain sight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had before him a white, blouselike jacket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">short blue trousers, a pair of bare yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">calves, a pigtail, long and slender--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The confounded chink!" he muttered, as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was not conscious of having looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">away; and yet right there, in the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture, without having come round the right-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand corner or the left-hand corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, without falling from the sky or surging</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from the ground, Wang had become visible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as large as life, and engaged in the young-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladyish occupation of picking flowers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Step by step, stooping repeatedly over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flower-beds at the foot of the veranda, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">startlingly materialized Chinaman passed off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene in a very commonplace manner, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">going up the steps and disappearing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness of the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only then the yellow eyes of Martin Ricar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">do lost their intent fixity. He understood that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was time for him to be moving. That bunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flowers going into the house in the hand of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Chinaman was for the breakfast-table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What else could it be for?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I'll give you flowers!" he muttered threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eningly. "You wait!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another moment, just for a glance toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Jones bungalow, whence he expected Heyst</seg><seg type="columnLine">to issue on his way to that breakfast so of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fensively decorated, and Ricardo began his</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreat. His impulse, his desire, was for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush into the open, face to face with the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed victim, for what he .called a " ripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">up." visualized greedily, and always with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift, preliminary, stooping movement on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">part--the forerunner of certain death to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">adversary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was his impulse; and as it was, so to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak, constitutional, it was extremely diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult to resist when his blood was up. What</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could be more trying than to have to skulk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dodge and conceal oneself mentally and</seg><seg type="columnLine">physically, when one's blood was up?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Secretary Ricardo was being severely</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried as he began his retreat from his post of</seg><seg type="columnLine">observation behind a tree opposite Heyst's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow, using great care to remain unseen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His proceedings were made easier by the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clivity of the ground, which sloped sharply to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water's edge. There, his feet feeling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth of the island's rocky foundation al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready heated by the sun, through the thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">soles of his straw slippers, he was, as it were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunk out of sight of the houses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A short scramble of some twenty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him up again to the upper level, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place where the jetty had its root in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore. He leaned his back against one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">uprights which still held up the Tropical Belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coal Company's sign-board above the mound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of derelict coal. Nobody could have guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much his blood was up. To contain him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, he folded his arms tightly on his breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What exasperated him just now was his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability to understand Heyst. Ricardo was hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man enough to suffer from the discovery of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">limitations. No, he couldn't size him up. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could kill him with extreme ease--a growl and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spring--but that was forbidden!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved on, his head swimming a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the repressed desire of violence, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out openly in front of the bungalows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he had just been down to the jetty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at the boat. The sunshine enveloped him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">very brilliant, very still, very hot. The three</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings faced him. The one with the rug</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the balustrade was the most distant; next</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it was the empty bungalow; the nearest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the flower-beds at the foot of its veranda,</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained that bothersome girl, who had man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged so provokingly to keep herself invisible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo could not hang about openly much</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer; but, like a concealed magnet, the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">exercised her attraction. As he went on, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">deviated toward the bungalow. Though his</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements were deliberate, his feral instincts</seg><seg type="columnLine">had such sway that if he had seen Heyst walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward him, he would have had to satisfy</seg><seg type="columnLine">his need of violence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he saw nobody. Wang was at the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the house, keeping the coffee hot against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Number One's return for breakfast. Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">simian Pedro was out of sight, no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouching on the door-step, his eyes fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">with animal-like devotion on Mr. Jones, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in discourse with Heyst in the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow--the conversation of an evil specter</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a disarmed man, watched by an ape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">199</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   His will having very little to do with it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo, darting swift glances in all directions,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">found himself at the steps of the Heyst bunga-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">low.

Though every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">muscle of his body quivered with savage ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">citement, he kept all his wits about him. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had meant to note the aspect and nature of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">things, and hoped to draw some useful in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ference, some hint as to the man.

His eyes gleamed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sidewise at the heavy silver candlesticks--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">signs of opulence.

The woman, most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">likely, had sneaked out, and was walking about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">somewhere in the grounds at the back. She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had probably been ordered to keep out of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sight. Why? Because the fellow mistrusted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his guests; or was it because he mistrusted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For some time he had been looking at a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">closed door on the other side of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He would look into that other room, and per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  haps see something more informing than a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">confounded lot of books. As he crossed over,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he thought recklessly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     If the beggar comes in suddenly, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">starts to prance, I'll rip him up and be done</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   He laid his hand on the handle, and felt the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">door come unlatched. Before he pulled it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">open, he listened again to the silence. He felt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it all about him, complete, without a flaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The necessity of prudence had exasperated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his self-restraint. A mood of ferocity woke</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up in him, and, as always at such times, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">became physically aware of the sheeted knife</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strapped to his leg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   He pulled at the door with fierce curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It came open without a squeak of hinge, with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out a rustle, with no sound at all; and he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">found himself glaring at the opaque surface</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of some rough blue stuff, like serge. A cur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tain was fitted inside, heavy enough and long</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enough not to stir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   A curtain! This unexpected veil, baffling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his curiosity, checked his bruskness. He did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not fling it aside with an impatient movement;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he only looked at it closely, as if its texture</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had to be examined before his hand could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">touch such stuff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   In this interval of hesitation he seemed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">detect a flaw in the perfection of the silence,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the faintest possible rustle, which his ears</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">caught and instantly, in the effort of con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scious listening, lost again. No! Everything</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was still inside and outside the house, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he had no longer the sense of being alone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   W'hen he put_ out his hand toward the mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tionless folds, it was with extreme caution,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and only to push the stuff aside a little, ad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vancing his head at the same time to peep</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">within. A moment of complete immobility</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ensued. Then, without anything else of him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stirring, his head shrank back on his shoul-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ders and his arm descended slowly to his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He had seen a woman in there. The very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woman!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   In that room, lighted dimly bv the reflec-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion of the outer glare, she loomed up strange-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ly big and shadowy at the other end of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">narrow room. With her back to the door, she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was doing her hair with her bare arms up-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lifted. One of them gleamed pearlv white;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the other detached its perfect form in black</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">against the unshuttered, uncurtained square of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">window. She was there, her fingers busy with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her dark hair, utterly unconscious, exposed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and defenseless--and tempting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo drew back one foot and pressed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">200</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUNSEY'S MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">elbows close to his sides; his chest started</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaving convulsively, as if he were wrestling</seg><seg type="columnLine">or running a race; his body began to sway</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently back and forth. The self-restraint was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at an end; his psychology must have its way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The instinct for the feral thing could no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer be denied. Ravish or kill--it was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to him, as long as by the act he liberated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the repressed soul of savagery which had suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered within him for so long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a quick glance back over his shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which hunters of big game tell us no lion or</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiger omits to give before charging home, Ri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cardo charged, head first, straight at the cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain. The stuff, tossed violently upward by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rush, settled itself with a slow, floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion into vertical folds, motionless, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shudder even in the still, warm air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XXVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clock --which once upon a time had</seg><seg type="columnLine">measured the hours of philosophic meditation</seg><seg type="columnLine">--could not have ticked away more than five</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds when Wang materialized within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">living-room. His concern primarily was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the delayed breakfast, but at once his slant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing eyes became immovably fixed upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unstirring curtain. For it was behind it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had located the strange, deadened, scuffling</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds which filled the empty room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slanting eyes of his race could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">achieve a round, amazed stare; but they be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came still, dead still, and his impassive yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">face grew all at once care-worn and lean with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sudden strain of intense, doubtful, fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened watchfulness. Contrary impulses swayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body, rooted to the floor-mats. He even</seg><seg type="columnLine">went so far as to extend his hand toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtain. He could not reach it as he stood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he didn't make the necessary step for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mysterious struggle was going on with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quick thumping of bare feet, as in a wres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tling-match. It was a mute fierceness of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">test; no human sound, hiss, groan, murmur, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation coming through the curtain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A chair fell over in there, not with a crash,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but lightly, as if just grazed, and a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic ring of the tin bath succeeded. Final-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly the tense silence, as of two adversaries</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked in a deadly grip, was ended by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy, dull thud of a soft body flung against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner partition of planks. It seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake the whole bungalow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By that time, \yalking backward, his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his very throat, strained with fearful excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, his extended arm still pointing at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtain, Wang had disappeared through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back door. Once out in the compound, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolted round the end of the house. Emerging</seg><seg type="columnLine">innocently between the two bungalows, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingered and lounged in the open, where any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body issuing from any of the dwellings was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound to see him--a self-possessed Chinaman</seg><seg type="columnLine">idling there, with nothing but perhaps an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served breakfast on his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at this time that Wang made up hi3</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind to give up all connection with Number</seg><seg type="columnLine">One, a man not only disarmed but already half</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanquished. Till that morning he had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubts as to his course of action, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">overheard scuffle decided the question. Num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber One was a doomed man--one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings whom it is unlucky to help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as he walked about with a fine air of</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconcern, Wang wondered that no sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any sort was to be heard inside the house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For all he knew, the white mem might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been scuffling in there with an evil spirit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had, of course, killed her. For nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible came out of the house as he watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the slanting corner of his eye. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunshine and the silence outside the bungalow</seg><seg type="columnLine">reigned undisturbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in the house the silence of the big room</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have struck an acute ear as per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect. It was troubled by a stir so faint that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could hardly be called a ghost of whisper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from behind the curtain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo, feeling his throat with tender care,</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed out admiringly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have fingers like steel. Jiminy!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You have muscles like a giant!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Luckily for the girl, Ricardo's onset had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so sudden--she was winding her two</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy tresses round her head--that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time to lower her arms. This, which saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from being pinned to her sides, gave her</seg><seg type="columnLine">a better chance to resist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His spring had nearly thrown her down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luckily, again, she was standing so near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall that, though she was driven against it</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlong, yet the shock was not heavy enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to knock all the breath out of her body. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contrary, it helped her first instinctive at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to drive her assailant backward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the first gasp of a surprise that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">really too overpowering for a cry, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">never in doubt of the nature of the danger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She defended herself in the full, clear knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of it, from the force of instinct which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the true source of every great display of</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy, and with a determination which could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly have been expected from a girl who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornered in a dim corridor by the red-faced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stammering Schomberg, had trembled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">201</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shame, disgust, and fear; had drooped, terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied, before mere words spluttered odiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a man who had never in his life laid his</seg><seg type="columnLine">big paw on her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This new enemy's attack was simple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightforward violence. It was not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slimy, underhand plotting to deliver her up</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a slave which had sickened her heart and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made her feel in her loneliness that her</seg><seg type="columnLine">oppressors were too many for her. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer alone in the world now. She re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted without a moment of faltering, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was no longer deprived of moral support;</seg><seg type="columnLine">because she was a human being who counted;</seg><seg type="columnLine">because she was no longer defending herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for herself alone; because of the faith that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been born in her--the faith in the man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her destiny, and perhaps in the Heaven which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sent him so wonderfully to cross her path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had defended herself principally by</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripping Ricardo's windpipe with her fingers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">till she felt a slight relaxation of the terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">hug in which he stupidly and ineffectually</seg><seg type="columnLine">persisted to hold her. Then, with a supreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort of her arms and of her suddenly raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee, she sent him flying against the partition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cedar-wood chest stood in the way, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo, with a thump which boomed hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the whole bungalow, fell on it in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting posture, half strangled, and exhausted</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so much by the efforts as by the emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of the struggle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the recoil of her exerted strength, she,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, staggered back a little, and sat on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the bed. Her legs crossed, breathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, but calm and unabashed, she busied</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself in readjusting under her arms the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown and yellow figured Celebes sarong, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuck of which "had come undone during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight. Then, folding her bare arms tightly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her breast, she leaned forward on them, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined and without fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo, leaning forward too, his nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">force gone, crestfallen, like a beast of prey</seg><seg type="columnLine">that has missed its spring, met her big gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes looking at him--wide open, observing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious--from under the dark arches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her courageous eyebrows. Their faces were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a foot apart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ceased feeling about his aching throat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dropped the palms of his hands heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his knees. He was not looking at her bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders, at her strong arms; he was looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the floor. He had lost one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">straw slippers. A chair with a white dress</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it had been overturned. These, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashes of water from a misplaced sponge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bath. were the only traces of the struggle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo swallowed twice consciously, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make sure of his throat, before he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">again:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " All right. I never meant to hurt you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I am no joker when it comes to it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pulled up the leg of his pajamas to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hibit the strapped knife.

Then, in a mere breath:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you know anything about him?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked, concealing her puzzled alarm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" What has it got to do with you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Everything," was Ricardo's concise an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer. in a low, emphatic whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He reflected that this girl was really his best</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope.

She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to understand. His words conveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a definite, dreadful meaning to her mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he proceeded to enlighten further in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced murmur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You and I are made to understand each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other.

Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">encouraged, directed in the way of duplicity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the refuge of the weak, she made a heroically</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious effort and forced her stiff, cold lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duplicity--the refuge of the weak and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowardly, but of the disarmed, too!

She did not hear it strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything; it just vanished, as if it had wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fly on through the air. Not a sound! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her valiant arms hanging close against her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, she stood as if turned into stone. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint whistle reached her ears. The forgetful</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo, becoming very much aware of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss, had been hanging about in great anxiety,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was relieved by the appearance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipper flying from under the eaves; and now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully, he had ventured a whistle to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mind at ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the girl reeled forward. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved herself from a fall only by embracing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with both arms one of the tall, rudely carved</seg><seg type="columnLine">posts holding the mosquito-net above the bed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a long time she clung to it. with her fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head leaning against the wood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  One side of her loosened sarong had slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down as low as her hip. The long, brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">tresses of her hair hung down in wisps, lank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if wet, looking almost black against her</seg><seg type="columnLine">white body. Her uncovered flank, damp with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sweat of anguish and fatigue, gleamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">coldly with the immobility of polished marble</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hot, diffused light falling through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window above her head--a dim reflection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the consuming, passionate blaze of sunshine</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside, all aquiver with the effort to set the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth on fire, to burn it to ashes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XXX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst, seated at the table with his chin on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breast, raised his head at the faint rustle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Lena's dress.

But to his anxious inquiries</seg><seg type="columnLine">she answered reassuringly, if in a very low</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, that there was nothing the matter with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, really. She had felt giddy on rising. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had even had a moment of faintness after her</seg><seg type="columnLine">bath. She had to sit down to wait for it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass. This had made her late dressing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I didn't try to do my hair.

She had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">done her hair, but she had brushed if, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tied it with a ribbon behind. With her</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead uncovered, she looked very young,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost a child, a care-worn child; a child with</seg><seg type="columnLine">something on its mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What surprised Heyst was the non-appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of Wang.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the usual miracle failed.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow hands, lightly clasped, hung idly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween his knees.

His only tie in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the Alfuro woman in exchange for whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had given away some considerable part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hard-earned substance; and his duty, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason, could be to no one but himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scuffle behind the curtain was a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bad augury for that Number One for</seg><seg type="columnLine">206</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUXSEY'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whom the Chinaman had neither love nor dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like.

Everything around, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stillness itself, appeared so deathlike that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heyst felt an impulse to break the silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">with some useless words; but there is that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">us which at certain moments becomes dumb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He went on looking at her. The sleep-ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">livion of this world, where wakeful faces carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sorrow the degrading marks of the past,</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed him to perceive the wonder of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">native distinction. Feeling deeply all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charm she had for him, he became saddened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if by a cruel reminder of his lost inde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendence. At the same time he was moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a strange compassion for her. He sighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went out of the room with hushed foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was no sooner alone in the outer room</seg><seg type="columnLine">than, very naturally, he thought of the ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sconding Wang. The Chinaman's departure</seg><seg type="columnLine">altered the situation. Heyst reflected on</seg><seg type="columnLine">what would be best to do in'view of that fact.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a long time he hesitated: then, shrugging</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders wearily, he walked out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda, down the steps, and continued at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady gait, w-ith a thoughtful mien, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of his guests' bungalow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wanted to make an important communi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cation, and he had no other object--least of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all to give them the shock of a surprise call.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevertheless, their brutish henchman not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on watch, it was Heyst's fate to startle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Jones and his secretary by his sudden ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance in the doorway. Their conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been very interesting to prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from hearing the visitor's approach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the dim room--the shutters were kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">constantly closed against the heat--Heyst saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them start apart. It was Mr. Jones who</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, here you are again! Come in, come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst, taking his hat off in the doorway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XXXI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Waking up suddenly, Lena looked, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising her head from the pillow, at the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which she was alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mysterious, wordless whispers heard in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her slumbers were now replaced by the si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence of a complete wakeful recollection. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">got up quickly, as if to counteract the awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinking of her heart by the vigorous use of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs. But this sinking was only momentary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mistress of herself from pride, from love,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from necessity, and also because of a woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanity in self-sacrifice, she met Heyst, return-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the strangers' bungalow, with a clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance and a smile. The smile he managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer; but, noticing that he avoided her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, she composed her lips and lowered her</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the same reason she hastened to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him in a tone of indifference, which she put</seg><seg type="columnLine">on without effort, as if she had grown adept</seg><seg type="columnLine">in duplicity since sunrise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have been over there again?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I have. I thought--but you had better</seg><seg type="columnLine">know first that we have lost Wang for good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She repeated "For good?" as if she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " For good or evil--I shouldn't know which</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you were to ask me. He has dismissed him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. He's gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You expected him to go, though, didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst sat down on the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. I expected it as soon as I discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered that he had annexed my revolver. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">says he hasn't taken it. That's of course. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinaman would not see the sense of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessing under any circumstances. To deny</seg><seg type="columnLine">any charge is a principle of right conduct;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he hardly expected to be believed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">209</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">did not have it on him, of that I am certain--</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least, not while he was talking to me in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. He lied with fine indignation. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps he was amused to see me before him</seg><seg type="columnLine">without arms and without force; and perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">not. He was a little enigmatic at the last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lena. He startled me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst paused. The girl, in profile, kept her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyelids lowered, and in her quietness seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed in her own thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He startled me," repeated Heyst. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted the anxiety in his tone, and turned her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head slightly to look at him across the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It must have been something--to startle</seg><seg type="columnLine">you" she said. In the depths of her parted</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, like a ripe pomegranate, there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam of white teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It was only a single word--and some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gestures. He had been milking a good deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of noise. I wonder we didn't wake you up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How soundly you can sleep! I say, do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel all right now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " As fresh as can be," she said, treating him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another deep gleam of a smile. " I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">no noise, and I'm glad of it. The way he</seg><seg type="columnLine">talks in his harsh voice frightens me. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">like all these foreign people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It was just before he went away--bolted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, I should say. He nodded and pointed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curtain of our room. He knew you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, of course. He seemed to think--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to try to give me to understand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were in special--well, danger. You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he talks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said nothing; she made no sound, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faint color ebbed out of her cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yes," Heyst went on. " He seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to warn me. That must have been it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did he imagine I had forgotten your exist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence? The only word he said was 'two.' It</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded so, at least. Yes, ' two '--and that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't like it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What does that mean?" she whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " We know what the word two means, don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">we, Lena? We are two. Never were such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely two out of the world, my dear! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have tried to remind me that he him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self has a woman to look after. Why are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">so pale, Lena?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Am I pale?" she asked negligently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You are." Heyst was really anxious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Well, it isn't from fright,"'she protested</seg><seg type="columnLine">truthfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indeed, what she felt was a sort of horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">which left her absolutely in the full posses-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of all her faculties; more difficult to bear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, for that reason, but not paralyzing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her fortitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst, in his turn, smiled at her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I really don't know that there is any</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to be frightened."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I mean I am not frightened for myself."</seg><seg type="columnLine">" I believe you are very plucky." he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The color had returned to her face. " I." con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued Heyst, ' am so rebellious to outward</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressions that I can't say that much about</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. I don't react with sufficient distinct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness." His tone changed. " You know I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see those men first thing this morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know. Be careful!" she murmured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I wonder how one can be careful! I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long talk with--but I don't believe you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen them. One of them is a fantastically</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin, long person, apparently ailing; I shouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder if he was really so. He makes rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">a point of it in a mysterious manner. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine he must have suffered from tropical</seg><seg type="columnLine">fevers, but not so much as he tries to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. He's what people would call a gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He seemed on the point of volunteering</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tale of his adventures--for which I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask him--but remarked that it was a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">story; some other time, perhaps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " ' I suppose you would like to know who</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am?' he asked me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I told him I would leave it to him, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone which, between gentlemen, could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">left no doubt in his mind. He raised himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his elbow--he was lying down on the camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed--and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " ' I am he who is--* "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lena seemed not to be listening; but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ileyst paused, she turned her head quickly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He took it for a movement of inquiry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in this he was wrong. A great vagueness</seg><seg type="columnLine">enveloped her impressions, but all her energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was concentrated on the struggle that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to take upon herself, in a great exalta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of love and self-sacrifice, which is wom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ans sublime faculty; altogether on herself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every bit of it, leaving him nothing, not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knowledge of what she did, if that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible. She would fight for his admired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved, incomprehensible, infinitely precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">identity--to save it, to penetrate it, to mingle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it, to make it her own!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Observing her eyes fixed and as if sightless</seg><seg type="columnLine">--for the concentration on her purpose took</seg><seg type="columnLine">all expression out of them--Heyst imagined it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be the effect of a great mental effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No use asking me what he meant, Lena;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't know, and I did not ask him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman, as I have told you before, seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted to mystification. I said nothing--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">What Heyst did not know was that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled at Mr. Jones in his usual urbane man-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg><seg type="columnLine">210</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUXSEY'S MAGAZIXE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, and that his almost mechanical smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had no other definite character but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of urbanity, had both irritated and discon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certed the other man. He had no idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being almost as enigmatical to Ricardo's gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernor as to Ricardo himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I said nothing," he went on, " and he laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his head again on the bundle of rugs he</seg><seg type="columnLine">uses for a pillow. He affects a state of great</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakness, but I suspect that he's perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of leaping to his feet if he likes. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid himself down at last, as I've said, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing that I was by no means anxious for</seg><seg type="columnLine">further enlightenment on those lines, he pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded to give it to me. Having been eject-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, he said, from his proper sphere because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had refused to conform to certain usual con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventions, he was* a rebel now, and was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">and going. As I really did not want to listen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all this nonsense, I told him that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard that sort of story about somebody else</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. His grin is really ghastly. He con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessed that I was very far from the sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man he expected to meet. Then he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " * As to me, I am no blacker than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman you are thinking of, and I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither more nor less determination.' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst looked across the table at Lena.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Propped on her elbows, and holding her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">in both hands, she moved it a little with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">air of understanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Nothing could be plainer, eh?" said Heyst</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly. " Unless, indeed, this is his idea of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant joke; for, when he finished speaking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he burst into a long, loud laugh. I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">join him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I wish you had," she breathed out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I didn't join him. It did not occur to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am not much of a diplomatist. I let him</seg><seg type="columnLine">have his laugh out by himself. He was sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king all over, like a merry skeleton, under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue cotton sheet he was covered with--I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve in order to conceal the revolver that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had in his right hand. I didn't see it, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a distinct impression it was there in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist. As he had not been looking at me for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time, but staring into a certain part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room, I turned my head and saw a hairy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild sort of creature which they take about</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them, squatting on its heels in the angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the walls behind me. He wasn't there when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I came in. I didn't like the notion of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchful monster behind my back. If I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been less at their mercy, I should certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">have changed my position. As things are now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move would have been a mere weakness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So I remained where I was. The gentleman</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bed said he could assure me of one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing; and that was that his presence here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no more morally reprehensible than mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " ' We pursue the same ends,' he said, ' only</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps I pursue them with more openness</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you--with more simplicity.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " That's what he said," Heyst went on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after looking at Lena in a sort of inquiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. " I asked him if he knew before-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand that I was living here; but he only gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a ghastly grin. I didn't press him for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, Lena. I thought I had better not."</seg><seg type="columnLine">On her smooth forehead a ray of light al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways seemed to rest. Her loose hair, parted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the middle, covered the hands sustaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head. She seemed spellbound by the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest of the narrative. Heyst did not pause</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. He managed to continue his relation</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly enough, beginning afresh with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of comment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " He would have lied impudently--and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">detest being told a lie. It makes me uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable. It's pretty clear that I am not fitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the affairs of the wide world. But I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not want him to think that I accepted his pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence too meekly; so I said that his comings or</seg><seg type="columnLine">goings on the earth were none of my business,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, except that I had a natural curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osity to know when he would find it con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venient to resume them. He asked me to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the state he was in. Had I been all alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, as they think I am, I should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at him. But not being alone--I say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lena, you are sure you haven't shown yourself</seg><seg type="columnLine">where you could be seen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Certain." she said promptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked relieved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You understand, Lena, that when I ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to keep so strictly out of sight, it is be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause you are not for them to look at--to talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. My poor Lena! I can't help that</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling. Do you understand it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She moved her head slightly in a manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was neither affirmative nor negative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " People will have to see me some day," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I wonder how long it will be possible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to keep out of sight!" murmured Heyst</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully.

His secretary, who was really</seg><seg type="columnLine">his partner, was not present, having gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the wharf to look at their boat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally the fellow proposed that he should put</seg><seg type="columnLine">off a certain communication he had to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">till the day after to-morrow.

" I left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him there, lying on his side with his eyes shut.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I got back here, I found you looking ill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was it, Lena?

I sat down here to</seg><seg type="columnLine">consider all these things calmly, to try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrate their inner meaning and see all their</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward bearing. It struck me that these two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days that we have before us have the char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acter of a sort of truce. The more I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, the more I felt that this was tacitly un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood between Jones and myself. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our advantage, if anything can be of ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage to people caught so completely un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">awares as we are. Wang was gone. He, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any rate, had declared himself and had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own line.

Mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time she had risen in her turn, to take a peep</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the compound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst, glancing over his shoulder, saw her</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning to her seat.

He had never seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">such an expression in her face before. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaminess in it, intense attention, and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like sternness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arrested in the doorway by Heyst's extend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed arm, she seemed to wake up, flushed faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and this flush, passing off, seemed to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with it the strange transfiguring mood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a courageous gesture she pushed back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy masses of her hair.

We will go at once!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Wait till I put my hair up," she said in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stantly, and vanished behind the curtain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When the curtain had fallen behind her, she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turned her head back with an expression of in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">finite and tender concern for him --for him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whom she could never hope to understand,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and whom she was afraid she could never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">satisfy; as if her passion were of a hopelessly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lower quality, unable to appease some exalted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and delicate desire of his superior soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In a couple of minutes she reappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They left the house by the door of the com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pound, and passed within three feet of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thunderstruck Pedro, without even looking in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his direction. He rose from stooping over a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fire of sticks, and, balancing himself clumsily,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">uncovered his enormous fangs in gaping as-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tonishment. Then suddenly he set off, rolling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on his bandy legs, to impart to his masters the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">astonishing discovery of a woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XXXII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As luck would have it, Ricardo was lounging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alone on the veranda of the foriper counting-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">house. He scented some new development at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">once, and ran down to meet the trotting, bear-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">^ like figure. The deep, growling noises it made,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">though they had only a very remote resem-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blance to the Spanish language, or indeed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any sort of human speech, were from long</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">practise quite intelligible to Mr. Jones's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">secretary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ricardo was rather surprised. He had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">imagined that the girl would continue to keep</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out of the fight. That line apparently was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">given up. Pie did not mistrust her. How</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could he? He collected his wits and thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This was a change of policy, probably on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the part of Heyst. If so, what could it mean?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A deep fellow! Unless it was her doing; in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	which case--h-m--all right! Must be. She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would know what she was doing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Before him Pedro, lifting his feet alternate-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ly, swayed to and fro sidewise--his usual at-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">titude of expectation. His little red eyes, lost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the mass of hair, were motionless. Ricardo</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stared into them with calculated contempt and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said in a rough, angry voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " W'oman! Of course there is. We know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that without you!'' He gave the tame monster</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a push. Git! Vamose! Waddle! Get back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and cook the dinner! Which way did thev go,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pedro extended a huge, hairy forearm to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">show the direction, and went off on his bandy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">legs. Advancing a few steps, Ricardo was just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in time to see, above some bushes, two white</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">helmets moving side by side in the clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now that he had managed to keep Pedro</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from informing the governor that there was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a woman on the island, he could indulge in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speculation as to the movements of these peo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ple. His attitude toward Mr. Jones had un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dergone a spiritual change, of which he himself</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">w;as not yet fully aware.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That morning, before tiffin, after his escape</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the Heyst bungalow', completed in such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an inspiring way by the recovery of the slip-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">per, he had made his way to their allotted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">house, reeling as he ran. his head in a whirl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was wildly excited by visions of incon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ceivable promise. He waited to compose him-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">self before he dared to meet the governor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">On entering the room, he found Mr. Jones sit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ting on the camp bedstead like a tailor on his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">board, cross-legged, his long back against the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I say, sir! You aren't going to tell me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you are bored?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ''Bored? No! Where the deuce have you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been all this time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Observing -- watching -- nosing around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">What else? I knew you had company. Have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you talked freely, sir?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">215</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Yes, I have," muttered Mr. Jones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Not downright plain, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " No. I wished you had been here. You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">loaf all the morning, and now you come in out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of breath. What is it? What's the matter?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" I haven't been wasting my time out there,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said Ricardo. " Nothing's the matter. I--I--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">might have hurried a bit." He was, in truth,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">still panting; only it was not with running, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the tumult of thoughts and sensations</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long repressed, which had been set free by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">adventure of the morning. He was almost dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tracted by them now. He forgot himself in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the maze of possibilities threatening and in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spiring. "And so you had a long talk?" he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said, to gain time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ''Confound you! The sun hasn't affected</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">your head, has it? Why are you staring at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me like a basilisk?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Beg pardon, sir. Wasn't aware I stared,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo apologized good-humoredly. " The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sun might well affect a thicker skull than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mine. It blazes. Phew! What do you think</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a fellow is, sir--a salamander?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You ought to have been here," observed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Jones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Did the beast give any signs of wanting to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prance?" asked Ricardo quickly, with abso-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lutely genuine anxiety. " It wouldn't do, sir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You must play him easy for at least a couple</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of days, sir. I have a plan. I have a notion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that I can find out a lot in a couple of days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" You have? In what way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Why, by watching," Ricardo answered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mr. Jones grunted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Nothing new, that. Watch, eh? Why not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">play a little, too?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ha, ha, ha! That's a good one," burst</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out the secretary, fixing Mr. Jones with mirth-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">less eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The latter dropped the subject indolently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Oh, you may be certain of at least two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">days," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ricardo recovered himself. His eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gleamed voluptuously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " We'll pull this off yet--clean--whole--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">right through, if you will only trust me, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I am trusting you right enough," said Mr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jones. " It's your interest, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo went out of the room. It was im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">possible for him to keep still. He walked up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and down the veranda far into the afternoon,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eying the other bungalow at every turn. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gave no sign of being inhabited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Once or twice he stopped dead short and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looked down at his left slipper. Each time he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chuckled audibly. His restlessness kept on in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">creasing till at last it frightened him. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">caught hold of the balustrade of the veranda</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and stood still, smiling not to his thoughts but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to his feelings, to the strong sense of life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">within him. He abandoned himself to it care-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lessly, even recklessly. He cared for no one,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">friend or enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At that moment Mr. Jones called him by</seg><seg type="columnLine">name from within. A shadow fell on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Here, sir," he answered; but it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment before he could make up his mind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He found his governor on his feet. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones was tired of lying down when there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no necessity for it. His slender form, gliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the room, came to a standstill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I've been thinking, Martin, of something</seg><seg type="columnLine">you suggested. At the time it did not strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as practical; but on reflection it seems to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that to propose a game is as good a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">as any to let him understand that the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">has come to disgorge. It's less--how should</seg><seg type="columnLine">I say?--vulgar. He will know what it means.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It s not a bad form to give to the business--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which in itself is crude, Martin, crude."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Want to spare his feelings?" jeered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary in such a bitter tone that Mr. Jones</seg><seg type="columnLine">was really surprised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Why, it was your own notion, confound</seg><seg type="columnLine">you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Who says it wasn't?" retorted Ricardo</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulkily.^ " But I am fairly sick of this crawl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. No, no! Get the exact bearings of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">swag and then a rip up. That's plenty good</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His passions being thoroughly aroused, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirst for blood was allied in him with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirst for tenderness--yes, tenderness. A sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of anxious, melting sensation pervaded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">softened his heart when he thought of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl--one of his own sort. And at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time jealousy started gnawing at his breast as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the image of Heyst intruded itself on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce anticipation of bliss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " The crudeness of your ferocity is positive-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ly gross, Martin," Mr. Jones said disdainfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" You don't even understand my purpose. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean to have some sport out of him. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to imagine the atmosphere of the game--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fellow handling the cards--the agonizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">mockery of it! Oh, I shall appreciate this</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly. Yes, let him lose his money instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being forced to hand it over. You, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, would shoot him at once, but I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoy the refinement and the jest of it. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man of the best society. I've been hounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of my sphere by people very much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">216</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUNSEY'S MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that fellow.

I promise myself some exquisite mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments while watching his play."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Aye, and suppose he suddenly starts</seg><seg type="columnLine">prancing! He may not appreciate the fun."</seg><seg type="columnLine">" I mean you to be present," Mr. Jones re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked calmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Well, as long as I am free to plug him or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rip him up whenever I think the time has</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, you are welcome to your bit of sport,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir. I sha'n't spoil it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XXXIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at this precise moment of their con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation that Heyst had intruded on Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones and his secretary with his warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Wang, which he had related to Lena.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he left them, the two looked at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other in wondering silence. Mr. Jones was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to break it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say, Martin!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Yes, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What does this mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It's some move. Blame me if I can un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too deep for you?" Mr. Jones inquired</seg><seg type="columnLine">dryly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It's nothing but some of his infernal im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pudence," growled the secretary. " You don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe all that about the chink, do you, sir?</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Tain't true."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It isn't necessary for it to be true to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a meaning for us. It's the why of his coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell us this'tale that's important."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Do you think he made it up to frighten</seg><seg type="columnLine">us?" asked Ricardo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Jones scow'led at him thoughtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " The man looked worried," he muttered, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if to himself. " Suppose that Chinaman has</seg><seg type="columnLine">really stolen his money! The man looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">very worried."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Nothing but his artfulness, sir," protested</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo earnestly, for the idea was too dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerting to entertain. " Is it likely that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have trusted a chink W'ith enough knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge to make it possible?" he argued warmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Why, it's the very thing that he would keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">close about. There's something else there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aye, but what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Ha, ha, ha!" Mr. Jones let out a ghostly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeaky laugh. "I've never been placed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a ridiculous position before," he went on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sepulchral 'equanimity of tone. " It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Martin, who dragged me into it. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, it's my fault, too. â¢ I ought to--but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was really too bored to use my brain, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours is not to be trusted. You are a hot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A blasphemous exclamation of grief es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caped from Ricardo. Not to be trusted! Hot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head! He was almost tearful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Haven't I heard you, sir, saying more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty times since we got fired out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manila that we should want a lot of capital</seg><seg type="columnLine">to w-ork the East Coast with? You were al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways telling me that to prime properly all</seg><seg type="columnLine">them officials and Portuguese scalawags wre</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have to lose heavily at first. Weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you always worrying about some means of get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting hold of a good lot of cash? It wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be got hold of by allowing yourself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">become bored in that rotten Dutch town and</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing a twopenny game with counfounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">beggarly bank clerks and such like. Well, I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought you here, where there is cash to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">got--and a big lot, to a moral," he added</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his set teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silence fell. Each of them was staring into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a different corner of the room. Suddenly, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slight stamp of his foot, Mr. Jones made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. Ricardo caught him up outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Put your arm through mine, sir," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">begged him gently but firmly. " No use giv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the game away. An invalid may well come</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for a breath of fresh air after the sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone down a bit. That's it, sir. But where</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you want to go? Why did you come out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Jones stopped short,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I hardly know myself," he confessed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollow mutter, staring intently at the Number</seg><seg type="columnLine">One bungalow. " It's quite irrational," he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared in a still lower tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Better go in, sir," suggested Ricardo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" What's that? Those screens weren't down</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. He's spying from behind theril now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I bet--the dodging, artful, plotting beast that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Why not go over there and see if we can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to the bottom of this game?" was the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected proposal uttered by Mr. Jones. " He</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have to talk to us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo repressed a start of dismay, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment could not speak. He only</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed the governor's hand to his side in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " No, sir. What could you say? Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect to get to the bottom of his lies? How</seg><seg type="columnLine">could you make him talk? It isn't time yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come to grips with that gent. You don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I would hang back, do you? His chink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, I'll shoot like a dog the moment I</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch sight of him; but as to that Mr. Blasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heyst, the time isn't yet. My head's cooler</seg><seg type="columnLine">just now than yours. Let's go in again. Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are exposed here. Suppose he took it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">217</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his head to let off a gun on us! He's an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">accountable, 'yporcritical skunk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Allowing himself to be persuaded, Mr. Jones</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to his seclusion. The secretary, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, remained on the veranda--for the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose, he said, of seeing whether that chink</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't sneaking around; in which case he pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to take a long shot at the galoot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance the consequences. His real reason was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he wanted to be alone, aw'ay from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">governor's deep-sunk eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt a sentimental desire to indulge his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancies in solitude. A great change had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Mr. Ricardo since that morning. A whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of him which from prudence, from neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sity, from loyalty, had been kept dormant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was aroused now, coloring his thoughts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbing his mental poise by the vision of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such staggering consequences as, for instance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the possibility of an active conflict with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">governor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The appearance of the monstrous Pedro</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his news drew Ricardo out of a feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dreaminess wrapped up in a sense of im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pending trouble. A woman? Yes, there w'as</seg><seg type="columnLine">one; and it made all the difference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After driving away Pedro, and watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white helmets of Heyst and Lena vanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the bushes, he stood lost in meditation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where could they be off to like this?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentally asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The answer found by his speculative facul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties on their utmost stretch was--to meet that</seg><seg type="columnLine">chink. For in the desertion of Wang Ricardo</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not believe. It was a lying yarn, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">organic part of a dangerous plot. Heyst had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to combine some fresh move. But then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo felt sure that the girl was with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the girl, full of pluck, full of sense, full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding; an ally of his own kind!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went indoors briskly. Mr. Jones had</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed his cross-legged pose at the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bed, with his back against the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Anything new?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " No, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ricardo walked about the room as if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no care in the world. He hummed snatches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">song. Mr. Jones raised his waspish eyebrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sound. The secretary got down on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees before an old leather trunk, and, rum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maging in there, brought out a small looking-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass. He fell to examining his physiognomy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it with silent absorption.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I think I'll shave," he decided, getting up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave a sidelong glance at the governor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and repeated it several times during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation, which did not take long, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward, when, after putting away the imple-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, he resumed his walking, humming more</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatches of unknown songs. Mr. Jones pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served a complete immobility, his thin lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">compressed, his eyes veiled. His face was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a carving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " So you would like to try your hand at</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards with that skunk, sir?" said Ricardo, stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping suddenly and rubbing his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Jones gave no sign of having heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, why not? Why shouldn't he have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the experience? You remember in that Mexi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can town--what's its name?--the robber fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low they caught in the mountains and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demned to be shot? He played cards half the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night with the jailer and the sheriff. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fellow is condemned, too. He must give</seg><seg type="columnLine">you your game. Hang it all, a gentleman</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to have some little relaxation! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have been uncommonly patient, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You are uncommonly volatile all of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden," Mr. Jones remarked in a bored voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" What's come to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The secretary hummed for a whil^, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 111 try to get him over here for you to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, after dinner.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer felt comfortable alone with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">governor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XXXIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime Heyst and Lena, walking rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, approached Wang's hut.

The smoky in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior was empty, except for a big chest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandalwood too heavy for hurried removal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its lid was thrown up. but whatever it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have contained was no longer there. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wang's possessions were gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without tarrying in the hut, Heyst came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the girl, who asked no questions, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her strange air of knowing nothing or under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Let us push on," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went ahead, the rustle of her white skirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">following him into the shades of the forest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the path of their usual walk. Twice he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked over his shoulder and smiled at her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind the readiness of her answering smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a fund of devoted, concentrated pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">218</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUXSEY'S MAGAZIXE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, burning with the hope of a more perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They passed the spot where it was their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">practise to turn toward the barren summit of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">, the central hill. Ileyst held steadily on his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way toward the upper limit of the forest. At</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the moment when they left its shelter a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. breeze enveloped them, and a great cloud,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">racing over the sun, threw a peculiar somber</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tint over everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Lena looked upward quickly, as if surprised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Heyst pointed up a precipitous, rugged path</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clinging to the side of the hill.

A gentle breeze, sweeping over the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">top, stirred them a little; but what had startled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the girl wras the discovery of three spear-blades</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">protruding from the mass of foliage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " You had better let me go forward alone,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lena," said Heyst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She tugged persistently at his arm, but after</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">â¢a time, during which he never ceased to look</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">smilingly into her terrified eyes, he ended by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">disengaging himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " It's a sign rather than a demonstration,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he remonstrated persuasively.

Recover-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing from the first flurry of her fright, Lena</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">noticed a commotion in the green top-dressing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ot the barricade. She exhaled a sigh of relief</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when the spear-blades retreated out of sight,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sliding inward--the horrible things!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a spot facing Heyst a pair of yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands parted the leaves, and a face filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small opening--a face with very noticeable</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. It was Wang's face, of course, with no</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion of a body belonging to it. like those</seg><seg type="columnLine">cardboard faces at which she remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing as a child in the window of a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim shop kept by a mysterious little man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kingsland Road. But this face, instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere holes, had eyes which blinked. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the beating of the eyelids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hands on each side of the face, keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boughs apart, also did not look as if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">belonged to any real body.

She was too far down the path to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the dialogue, carried on in an ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She waited patiently for its end. Her shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders felt the warmth of the rock; now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a whiff of cooler air seemed to slip down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon her head from above; the ravine at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, choked full of vegetation, emitted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint, drowsy hum of insect life. Everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very quiet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She failed to notice the exact moment when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wang's head vanished from the foliage, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unreal hands away with it.

His great</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustache did not quite hide an ugly but ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolute smile; and when he had come down</seg><seg type="columnLine">near enough to touch her, he burst out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a harsh laugh:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha. ha, ha!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at him uncomprehending.

Something in me thinks--something</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreign to my nature. What is the matter?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He noticed her suddenly parted lips, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peculiar stare in her eyes, which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">w-andered from his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " There's somebody after us.

No!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What else is left to us? I did think for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of the mine; but even there we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not remain very long. And then that gallery</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not safe. The props were too weak to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gin with.

Nothing met</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes but the deepening shadows of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">short vistas between the living columns pf the</seg><seg type="columnLine">still roof of leaves.

"We could get into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, and--only they have taken everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of her. I have seen her oars and sail in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner of their room. To get in and shove</seg><seg type="columnLine">off in an empty boat would be nothing but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate expedient, supposing even that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would drift out a good distance between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands before the morning. It would only be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a complicated manner of committing suicide</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to be found dead in a boat, dead from sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thirst, a sea mystery. I wonder who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find us! Davidson, perhaps; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davidson went westward ten days ago. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him steaming past one early morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, from the jetty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You never told me," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " He must have been looking at me through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his big binoculars.

He won't be back this</seg><seg type="columnLine">way for three weeks or more, Lena.

No good, of course. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no forebodings.

Her heart sank in the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulfing stillness; at that moment she felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearness of death breathing on her and on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with her. If there had been a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">stir of leaves, the crack of a dry branch, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintest rustle, she would have screamed aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she shook off the unworthy weakness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Such as she was, a fiddle-scraping girl picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on the very threshold of infamy, she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">221</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">try to rise above herself, triumphant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtible; and then happiness would burst on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her like a torrent, flinging at her feet the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom she loved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst stirred slightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " We had better be getting back, Lena, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can't stay all night in the woods--or any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where else, for that matter.

He joined her cautiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What is it? What do you see, Lena?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said that it was only a thought that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come into her head.

She wanted to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether this trouble, this danger, this evil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever it was. finding them out in their re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treat, was not a sort of punishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Punishment?" repeated Heyst.

What for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw her pale face darken in- the dusk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had blushed. Her whispering flowed very</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. It was the way they lived together--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that wasn't right, was it? It was a guilty life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For she had not been forced into it, driven,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared into it. No, no--she had come to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her own free will, with her whole soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">yearning unlawfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was so profoundly touched that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not speak for a moment.

Are our visitors, then, messengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of morality, avengers of righteousness, agents</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Providence? That's certainly an original</seg><seg type="columnLine">view. How flattered they would be if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Now you are making fun of me," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a subdued voice which broke suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you conscious of sin?"

She snatched her hand away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stepped out into the open; but before she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had advanced more than three yards she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood still and pointed to the west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, look there!" she exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the headland of Black Diamond Bay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying black on a purple sea, great masses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud stood piled up above the sunset, bathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a mist of blood.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a complete solitude. There was nothing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aspect of this familiar scene to tell him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he and the girl were not as completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone as they had been in the early days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their common life on this abandoned spot, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">only Wang discreetly materializing from time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to time and the uncomplaining memory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morrison to keep them company.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the cold gust of wind there was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolute stillness of the air.

Above it a reddish star came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an expelled spark from the fiery bosom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth, enchanted into permanency by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mysterious spell of frozen spaces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In front of Heyst the forest, already full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deepest shades, stood like a wall. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingered, watching its edge, especially where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended at the line of bushes, masking the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the jetty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since the girl had spQken of catching a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of something white among the trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he believed pretty firmly that they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed in their excursion up the mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Mr. Jones's secretary. No doubt the fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low had watched them out of the forest, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, unless he took the trouble to go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">some distance and fetch a considerable cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuit inland over the clearing, he was bound to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk out into the open space before the bunga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows. Heyst did, indeed, imagine at one time</seg><seg type="columnLine">some movement between the trees, lost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as perceived. He stared patiently, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing more happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After all, why should he trouble about these</seg><seg type="columnLine">people's actions? Why this stupid concern for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preliminaries, since, when the issue was</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined, it would find him disarmed and shrink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the ugliness and degradation of it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and entered the room. Deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusk reigned in there already. Lena, near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, did not move or speak. The sheen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">.the white table-cloth was very obtrusive. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute that these two vagabonds had tamed had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered on its service while Heyst and Lena</seg><seg type="columnLine">were away. The table was laid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst walked up and down the room several</seg><seg type="columnLine">times. The girl remained without sound or</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement on the chair, as if she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind, dumb, dead. But when Heyst busied</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in placing the two silver candelabra</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the table, and struck a match to light the</seg><seg type="columnLine">candles, she got up suddenly and went into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bedroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She came out again almost immediately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having taken off her hat. Heyst looked at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What's the good of shirking the evil hour? *</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've lighted these candles for a sign of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">return. After all, we might not have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched--while returning, I mean. Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were seen leaving the house."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl sat down again. The great wealth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her hair looked very dark above her color-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less face. She raised her eyes without ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression, glistening softly in the light with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of unreadable appeal, with a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of unseeing innocence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yes," said Heyst across the table, the fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger-tips of one hand resting on the immacu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late cloth. " A creature with an antediluvian</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower jaw, hairy like a mastodon, and formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a prehistoric ape, has laid this table.

Three covers.

Ah, you don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a jaguar is? But you have had a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at these two. It's the short one, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, who's to be our guest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She made a sign with her head that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew. Heyst's insistence brought Ricardo</seg><seg type="columnLine">vividly before her mental vision. A sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">languor, like the physical echo of her struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the man, paralyzed all her limbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst had started to pace the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Our guest!

But it leads one into</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble as well as any other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl unexpectedly got up from the chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying her supple figure and stretching her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms above her head.

It did. She could stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and she could move her arms freely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though no physiologist, she concluded that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sudden numbness was in her head, not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her limbs. Her fears assuaged, she thanked</seg><seg type="columnLine">God for it mentally, and to Heyst murmured</seg><seg type="columnLine">a protest:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes!

The habitual playful</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">223</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">smile faded on the kindly lips under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">martial mustache. " Ah, you remember what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have been told--as a child--on Sundays."</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Yes, I do remember." She sank into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair again.

I do want him out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way." He forced himself to speak equably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lor'! That's no great matter. Pedro's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not much use here. The business my gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernor's after can be settled by ten minutes'</seg><seg type="columnLine">rational talk with--with another gentleman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quiet talk!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked up suddenly with hard, phosphor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">escent eyes. Heyst didn't move a muscle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo congratulated himself on having left</seg><seg type="columnLine">his revolver behind. He was so exasperated</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he didn't know what he might have done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said at last:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You want poor, harmless Pedro out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way before you let me take you to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">governor--is that it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yes, that is it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " H-m! One can see," Ricardo said with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden venom, "that you are a gentleman;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but all that gentlemanly fancifulness is apt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn sour on a plain man's stomach. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever--you'll have to pardon me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put his fingers into his mouth and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a whistle which seemed to drive a thin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp shaft of air solidly against one's nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear-drum. Though he greatly enjoyed Heyst's</seg><seg type="columnLine">involuntary grimace, he sat perfectly stolid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for the effect of the call.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It brought Pedro in with an extraordinary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncouth, primeval impetuosity. The door flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">open with a clatter, and the wild figure it dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed seemed anxious to devastate the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a couple of whirls and bounds; but Ricardo</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his open palm, and the creature came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. His enormous, half-closed paws swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to and fro a little in front of his bowed trunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he walked. Ricardo looked on truculently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Go to the boat--understand? Go now!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The little red eyes of the tame monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinked with painful attention in the mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well? Why don't you get? Forgot hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man speech, eh? Don't you know any longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a boat is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Si -- boat," the creature stammered out</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Well, go there--the boat at the jetty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">March off to it and sit there, lay down there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">do anything but go to sleep there--till you â </seg><seg type="columnLine">hear my call, and then fly here. Them's your</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders. March! Get, vamose I No, not that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way--out through the front door. And mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, no sulks!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pedro obeyed with uncouth alacrity. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had gone, the gleam of pitiless savagery</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out of Ricardo's yellow eyes, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">physiognomy took on, for the first time that</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening, the expression of a domestic cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is being noticed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You can watch him right into the bushes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you like. Too dark, eh? Why not go with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to the very spot, then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst made a gesture of vague protest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " There's nothing to assure me that he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay there. I have no doubt of his going;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it's an act without a guarantee."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There you are!" Ricardo shrugged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders philosophically. " Can't be helped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Short of shooting our Pedro, nobody can make</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely sure of his staying in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">place longer than he has a mind to; but I tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, he lives in holy terror of my temper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's why I put on my sudden-death air when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I talk to him. And yet I wouldn't shoot him</seg><seg type="columnLine">--not I, unless in such a fit of rage as would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a man shoot his favorite dog. Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, sir! This deal is on the square. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't tip him a wink to do anything else. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't budge from the jetty. Are you coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">along now, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A short silence ensued. Ricardo's jaws were</seg><seg type="columnLine">working ominously under his skin. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">glided voluptuously here and there, cruel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamy. Heyst checked a sudden movement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected for a while, then said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You must wait a little."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a little! Wait a little! What does</seg><seg type="columnLine">he think a fellow is--a graven image?" grum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled Ricardo half audibly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst went into the bedroom, and shut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door after him with a bang. Coming from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, he could not see a thing in there at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first; yet he received the impression of the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting up from the floor. On the less opaque</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness of the shutter-hole, her head de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached itself suddenly, very faint, a mere hint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a round, dark shape without a face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I am going, Lena. I am going to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">those scoundrels." He was surprised to feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">two arms falling on his shoulders. " I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you--" he began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes!" the girl whispered hastily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She neither clung to him, nor yet did she</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to draw him to her. Her hands grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">227</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders, and she seemed to him to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring into his tace in the dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And now he could see something of her face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too --an oval without features --and faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguish her person, a something lighter in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blackness, a form without definite lines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " You have a black dress here, haven't you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lena?" he asked, speaking rapidly, and so low</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she could just hear him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Yes--an old thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Very good! Put it on at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " But why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not for mourning!" There was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing peremptory in the slightly ironic mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mur. " Can you find it and get into it in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She could. She would try. He waited, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">still. He could imagine her movements over</seg><seg type="columnLine">there at the far end of the room; but his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed now to the darkness, had lost her</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely. When she spoke, her voice sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised him by its nearness. She had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had told her to do, and had ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached him, invisible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Good! Where's that piece of purple veil</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've seen lying about?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was no answer, only a slight rustle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Where is it?" he repeated impatiently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her unexpected breath was on his cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " In my hands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Capital! Listen, Lena. As soon as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the bungalow with that horrible scoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drel, you slip out at the back--instantly, lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time! -- and run round into the forest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That will be your time, while w'e are walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and I can be sure he won't give me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slip. Run into the forest behind the fringe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes between the big trees. You will know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely, how to find a place in full view of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front door. I fear for you; but in this black</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress, with most of your face muffled up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dark veil, I defy anybody to find you</seg><seg type="columnLine">there before daylight. Wait in the forest till</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table is pushed into full view of the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and you see three candles out of four</seg><seg type="columnLine">blown out and one relighted--or, should the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights be put out here while you watch them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait till three candles are lighted and then tw'o</seg><seg type="columnLine">put out. At either of these signals run back</seg><seg type="columnLine">as hard as you can, for it will mean that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am waiting for you here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  While he was speaking, the girl had sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seized one of his hands. She did not press</seg><seg type="columnLine">it; she held it loosely, as it were, timidly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caressingly. It was no grasp; it was a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">contact, as if only to make sure that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, that he was real and no mere darker</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow in the obscurity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warmth of her hand gave Heyst a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, intimate sensation of all her person.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had to fight down a new sort of emotion</seg><seg type="columnLine">which almost unmanned him. He went on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispering sternly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " But if you see no such signals, don't let</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">anything--fear, curiosity, despair, or hope--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">entice you back to this house; and with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">first sign of the dawn steal away along the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">edge of the clearing till you strike the path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Wait no longer, because I shall probably be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The murmur of the word " Never!" floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his ear as if it had formed itself in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You know the path," he continued.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Make your way to the barricade. Go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wang--yes, to Wang. Let nothing stop you!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed to him that the girl's hand trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled a little. " The w'orst he can do to you is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shoot you; but he won't. I really think he</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't, if I am not there.

Think of some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal to call him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She made no answer. The sense of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy, brooding silence in the outside world</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to enter and fill the room--the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressive infinity of it, without breath, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. It was as if the heart of hearts had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to beat and the end of all things had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Have you understood? You are to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the house at once," Heyst whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">urgently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She swiftly lifted his hand to her lips and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">let it go. He was startled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Lena!" he cried out under his breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She was gone from his side.

To open the door, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to lift the curtain; he did so, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face over his shoulder. The merest trickle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light, coming through the keyhole and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two cracks, was enough for his eyes to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">her plainly, all black, down on her knees, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head and arms flung on the foot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed--all black in the desolation of a mourning</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  What was this? A suspicion that there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere more things than he could under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand crossed Heyst's mind.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something cruel in the absolute dumbness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the night. The great cloud covering half</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky seemed to hang right against one, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enormous curtain hiding menacing prepa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rations of violence. As the feet of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men touched the ground, a distant rumble</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from behind the cloud, preceded by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift, mysterious gleam of light on the waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha!" said Ricardo. "It begins."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It may be nothing in the end," observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heyst, stepping along steadily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!

Yes--from my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pocket."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  During this harangue Heyst looked de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">liberately over his shoulder, stepped back a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pace, and sat down on the end of the camp</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bedstead. Leaning his elbow on one knee, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">laid his cheek in the palm of his hand and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemed to meditate on what he should say</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">next.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Mr. Jones, planted against the wall, was ob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> viously waiting for some sort of overture. As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> nothing came, he resolved to speak himself;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> but he hesitated. For, though he considered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that the most difficult step had been taken,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he said to himself that every stage of progress</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> required great caution, lest the man, in Ri-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cardo's phraseology, should " start to prance "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> --which would be most inconvenient. He fell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> back on a previous statement:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   " And I am a person to be reckoned with."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other man went on looking at the floor,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as if he were alone in the room. There was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You have heard of me, then?" Heyst said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at length, looking up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I should think so! We have been staying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at Schomberg's hotel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Schom--" Heyst choked on the word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What's the matter, Mr. Heyst?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Nothing. Nausea," Heyst said resignedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He resumed his former attitude of meditative</seg><seg type="columnLine">indifference. " What is this reckoning you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking about?" he asked after a time, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietest possible tone. " I don't know you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It s obvious that we belong to the same--</seg><seg type="columnLine">social sphere," began Mr. Jones with languid</seg><seg type="columnLine">irony. Inwardly he was as watchful as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be. " Something has driven you out--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the originality of your ideas, perhaps. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case with me; and I wasn't going to go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison for it and weep publicly over my sins."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrâ Jones indulged in one of his ghastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiles. In repose his features had a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">character of evil, exhausted austerity; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he smiled, the whole mask took on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpleasantly infantile expression. A recrudes-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cence of the rolling thunder invaded the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">loudly, and passed into silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    " You are not taking this very well," ob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">served Mr. Jones. This was what he said,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but as a matter of fact he thought that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">business was shaping quite satisfactorily. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man, he said to himself, had no stomach for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a fight. Aloud he continued: "Come! You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">can t expect to have it always your own wray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You are a man of the world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "And you?" Heyst interrupted him unex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pectedly. " How do you define yourself?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I, my dear sir? In one way I am--yes,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I am the world itself, come to pay you a visit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In another sense I am an outcast--almost an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">outlaw. If you prefer a less materialistic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">view, I am a sort of fate--the retribution that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">waits its time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "I wish to goodness you were the com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">monest sort of ruffian!" said Heyst, raising his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">equable gaze to Mr. Jones. " One would be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able to talk to you straight, then, and hope</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for some humanity. As it is--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    I dislike violence and ferocity of every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sort as much as you do," Mr. Jones declared,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looking very languid as he leaned against the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wall, but speaking fairly loud. " You can ask</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my Martin if it is not so. This, Mr. Heyst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is a soft age. It is also an age without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prejudices. I've heard that you are free from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them yourself. You mustn't be shocked if I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tell you plainly that we are after your money</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--or I am, if you prefer to make me alone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">responsible. Pedro, of course, knows no more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of it than any other animal would. Ricardo</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is of the faithful retainer class--absolutely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">identified with all my ideas, wishes, and even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whims."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Jones pulled his left hand out of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pocket, got a handkerchief out of another, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">began to wipe the perspiration from his fore-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">head, neck, and chin. The excitement from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which he suffered made his breathing visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In his long dressing-gown he had the air of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">convalescent invalid who had imprudently</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">overtaxed his strength. Heyst, broad-shouf-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dered, robust, watched the operation from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">end of the camp bedstead, very calm, his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hands on his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" And by the bye," he asked, " where is he</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, that henchman of yours? Breaking into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my desk?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" That would be crude. Still, crudeness is</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of life's conditions." There was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest flavor of banter in the tone of Ri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cardo's governor. " Conceivable, but unlikely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin is a little crude; but you are not, Mr</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heyst. To tell you the truth, I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">230</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MUNSEY'S MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">precisely where he is. He has been a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious of late; but he has my confidence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, don't get up, Mr. Heyst!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The viciousness of his spectral face was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">describable. Heyst, who had moved a little,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was surprised by the phenomenon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It was not my intention," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Pray remain seated," Mr. Jones insisted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a languid voice, but with a very determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">glitter in his black eye-caverns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " If you were more observant," said Heyst</seg><seg type="columnLine">with dispassionate contempt, " you would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known before I had been five minutes in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room that I had no weapon of any sort on</seg><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Possibly; but pray keep your hands still.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are very well where they are. This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">too big an affair for me to take any risks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Big? Too big?" Heyst repeated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuine surprise. " Good Heavens! What-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever you are looking for, there's very little of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it here--very little of anything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You would naturally say so, but that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not what we have heard," retorted Mr. Jones</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, with a grin so ghastly that it was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to think it voluntary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst's face had grown very gloomy. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knitted his brows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What have you heard?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " A lot, Mr. Heyst--a lot," affirmed Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones. He was trying to recover his manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of languid superiority. " We have heard, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">instance, of a certain Morrison, once your</seg><seg type="columnLine">partner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heyst could not repress a slight movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aha!" said Mr. Jones, with a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghostly glee on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The muffled thunder resembled the echo of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distant cannonade below the horizon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two men seemed to be listening to it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullen silence.	*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This diabolical calumny will end in actu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally and literally taking my life from me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought Heyst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, suddenly, he laughed. Portentously</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectral, Mr. Jones listened to the sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " That's as you please," he said. " I, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been hounded out from society by a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of highly moral souls, can't see anything fun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ny in that story. But here we are, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will now have to pay for your fun, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heyst."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You have heard a lot of ugly lies," ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served Heyst. " Take my word for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You would say so, of course--very natural.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As a matter of fact, I haven't heard very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. Strictly speaking, it was Martin. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">collects information, and so on. You don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose I would talk to that Schomberg ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal more than I could help? It was Martin</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he took into his confidence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " The stupidity of that creature is so great</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it becomes formidable," Heyst said, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Involuntarily his mind turned to the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandering in the forest, alone and terrified.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would he ever see her again? At that thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">he nearly lost his self-possession. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculatively at Mr. Jones, who, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never for a moment taken his eyes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his intended victim. And the conviction came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Heyst that this outlaw from the higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres was an absolutely hard and pitiless</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoundrel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Jones's voice made him start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It would be useless, for instance, to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that your Chinaman has run off with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. A man living alone with a Chinaman</seg><seg type="columnLine">on an island takes care to conceal property</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that kind so well that the devil himself--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Certainly," Heyst muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again, with his left hand, Mr. Jones mopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his frontal bone, his stalklike neck, his razor</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaws, his fleshless chin. Again his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">faltered and his aspect became still more</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruesomely malevolent, as of a wicked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitiless corpse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I see what you mean," he cried, " but you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustn't put too much trust in your ingenuity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You don't strike me as a very ingenious per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, Mr. Heyst. Neither am I. My talents</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie another way. But Martin--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Who is now engaged in rifling my desk,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">interjected Heyst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I don't think so. What I was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say is .that Martin is much cleverer than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinaman. Do you believe in racial superiori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty, Mr. Heyst? I do, firmly. Martin is great</seg><seg type="columnLine">at ferreting out such secrets as yours, for in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Secrets like mine!" repeated Heyst bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terly. " Well, I wish him joy of all he can</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferret out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " That's very kind of you," remarked Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones. He was beginning to be anxious for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin's return. Of iron nerve at the gaming-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, fearless in a sudden affray, he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this rather special kind of work was tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on his nerves. "Keep still as you are!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cried sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I've told you I am not armed," said Heyst,</seg><seg type="columnLine">folding his arms on his breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I am really inclined to believe that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not," admitted Mr. Jones seriously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Strange!" he mused aloud, the caverns of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes turned upon Heyst. Then briskly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">231</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" But my object is to keep you in this room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Don't provoke me, by some unguarded move-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment, to smash your knee or do something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">definite of that sort." He passed his tongue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over his lips, which were dry and black, while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his forehead glistened with moisture. "I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">don't know if it wouldn't be better to do it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at once!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He who deliberates is lost," said Heyst</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with grave mockery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mr. Jones disregarded the remark. He had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the air of communing with himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Physically I am no match for you," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said slowly, his black gaze fixed upon the man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sitting on the end of the bed. " You could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spring--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Are you trying to frighten yourself?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">asked Heyst abruptly. " You don't seem to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have quite enough pluck for your business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Why don't you do it, for once?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mr. Jones, taking violent offense, snorted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like a savage skeleton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Strange as it may seem to you, it is be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cause of my origin, my breeding, my tradi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions, my early associations, and such like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trifles. Not everybody can divest himself of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the prejudices of a gentleman as easily as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you have done, Mr. Heyst. But don't worry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about my pluck. If you were to make a clean</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spring at me, you would receive in mid air,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so to speak, something that would make you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perfectly harmless by the time you landed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">No, don't misapprehend us, Mr. Heyst. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are--er-- adequate bandits; and we are after</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the fruit of your labors as a--er--successful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swindler. It's the way of the world--gorge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and disgorge!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He wearily inclined his head on his left</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. His vitality seemed exhausted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Even his sunken eyelids dropped a little with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the bony sockets. Only his thin, waspish,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beautifully penciled eyebrows, drawn together</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a little, suggested the will and the power to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sting--something vicious, unconquerable, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deadly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Fruits! Swindler!" repeated Heyst, with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out heat, almost without contempt. " You are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">giving yourself no end of trouble, you and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">your faithful henchman, to crack an empty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nut.

If the story of my riches were ever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so true, do you think Schomberg would have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">imparted it to you from sheer altruism?

It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spread itself all over him, enter his limbs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lodge in his entrails. He stopped sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, with a thought that he who experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a feeling had no business to live--or per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps was no longer living.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything--the bungalow, the forest, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open ground--trembled incessantly; the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky itself, shivered all the time, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only thing immovable in the shuddering uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse was the interior of the lighted room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman in black sitting in the light of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four candle-flames.

A tremor of impatience to clutch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightful thing, glimpsed once and unforget-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, agitated her hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet it was the instinctive flinging for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward of these very hands that stopped Ricar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">235</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">do dead short between the door and her chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ready obedience of a conquered man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who can bide his time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Her success disconcerted her.

She was even able to meet his eyes,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">oblique, apt to glide away, but now throwing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feral gleams of desire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " No!" he was saying, after an impassioned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">outpouring of words in which the most fero-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cious phrases of his love were mingled with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wooing accents of entreaty.

Ten times to-day when you, you, you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swam in my eye, I thought it would burst one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of my ribs or leap out of my throat.
