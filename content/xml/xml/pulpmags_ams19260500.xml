                        <ab>"<title>THE RUNAWAY SKYSCRAPER</title>," by <persName>Murray Lein- ster</persName>, a story of the Fourth Dimension, in which the great Metropolitan Life skyscraper in New
                            York vanishes into the Fourth Dimension. One of the most suprising tales we have ever read. (This story was scheduled for the May issue, but had to make room for the
                                <persName>Jules Verne</persName> story).</ab>
                        <ab>"<title>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVENTURES OF MR. FOS-DICK</title>," by <persName>Jack Morgan</persName>. Perhaps you did not know it, but there can be excellent humor in
                            scientifiction. One of the most excruciatingly funny stories, which at the same time is an excellent piece of scientifiction, is en-titled "<title>Mr. Fosdick Invents the

                            subject. One of the greatest short stories we have ever seen. (This story also was due for publication in May, and was crowded out by the conclusion of the <persName>Jules

                    <ab>A First Class Writing Machine For $1.50</ab>
                    <ab>A perfect little typewriter for $1.50. There are thousands of persons who would like to use a typewriter but whose needs and business do not war-rant the expense attached to
                        the pur-chase and use of a fifty or seventy-five dollar machine. To such persons we confidently recommend our Little Giant. It is strongly made, but simple in construction, so
                        that anyone can quickly learn to operate it, and write as rapidly as they would with pen and ink. The letters of the alphabet most frequently used are so grouped as to enable
                        one to write rapidly, the numerals 1 to 10, and the punctuation marks being together. With this machine you can send your best girl typewritten love letters, address envelipes,
                        make out bills, and do almost any kind of work not requiring large, expensive machine. With each typewriter we send a tube of ink and full printed instructions for using the
                        machine. Price com-plete $1.50 by mail postpaid to any address in the world.</ab>

                    <ab>Most remarkable Toy ever in-vented. By drawing the Tank backward, either with the hand or over the floor or table and then placing it down, it will crawl along, overcoming
                        obstacles, in the same life-like manner as the larger Tank that proved so deadly in the great war. What makes it go is somewhat of a mys-tery, for there is no mechan-ism to
                        wind up as is usually understood with mechanical toys, yet this tank will keep plodding along ten times longer than the ordinary run of toys. It will perform dozens of the most
                        wonderful stunts; it will go backward or forward at will. 8½ inches long. Price only 25 cents prepaid.</ab>

                        we've never seen it fail. Many novel and entertaining feats may be performed with the Sex Indicator. For example, similar results can be obtained with animals, cats, dogs,

                    <ab>The Magic Flute, or Human-stone, is a unique and novel instrument that is played with nose and mouth combined. There is just a little knack in playing it which, when once
                        ac-quired after a little practice will enable you to produce very sweet music that somewhat resembles a flute. There is no fingering, and once you have mastered it you can play
                        all kinds of music with facility and ease. When played as an accomponiment to a piano or any other musical instrument, the effect is as charming as it is surprising.</ab>

                        devised, such as holding the button against the throat or chest to reproduce speech without sound waves. $5.00 is given to anyone who sends in new suggestion for the use of the
                        Button providing the manufacturers find it suitable for use in their literature. PRICE $1.00 POSTPAID ANYWHERE.</ab>

                        fishing; boating, riding, tramping,--en- joying life to the full. The air is laden with deli- cate odors of dogwood, yellow jasmine, giant blue- berry, magnolia and a dozen
                        other blossoms. Spring has been with us nearly two months now, and Nature is at its best.</ab>
                    <ab>Then there's the summer to look forward to--delight- fully warm, yet not hot or sultry; blankets every night; rarely a troublesome insect; real summer! Thousands come to this

                    <ab>VILLA TASSO, FLORIDA</ab>
                    <ab>Villa Tasso is in the Florida National Forest on the bluffs of beautiful Chocta- whatchee Bay, 50 miles east of Pensacola. It is easily reached either by steamer or by motor,
                        being adjacent to the Appalachian Scenic Highway, Old Spanish Trail and the Cult Resorts Loop. It is high, dry and healthful. The water is sweet, pure and soft. Only 3½ miles
                        from the Gulf of Mexico, it is still well sheltered from any possible storms. Delightful bathing beach. Game abounds in the Forest.</ab>
                    <ab>Because it is only slightly developed as yet, you can still buy in this lovely spot a wonderful homesite for from $300 to $2000 -one-tenth of what less desirable lots would

                    <ab>Where Do New York's "Missing Women" Go?</ab>
                    <ab>"Alice, please come home. Mother heartbroken. All is forgiven." Another innocent girl "missing!" Another heart torn by anguish! Another mystery unsolved! 1,911 MISSING GIRLS
                        Were Reported Last Year! WHERE DID THEY GO? WHAT HORRIBLE SECRETS LAY AT THE ROOT OF THEIR DISAPPEARANCES?</ab>
                    <ab>The river . . . the marshes . . . and often a God-forsaken rooming house gives up the dead body of one of these unfortunate girls. But what of those who continue to live in
                        shame--humilia- tion--and black despair?</ab>
                    <ab>To rescue them from a living death--to check this greatest of social evils--to break up the systematic debauchery of women by daring publicity--that is what Ex-Commissioner
                        Richard E. En- right has set out to do.</ab>
                    <ab>Former Police Commissioner Enright.</ab>
                    <ab>ENRIGHT Discloses Horrors of "White Slave" Traffic</ab>
                    <ab/>
                    <ab>It is estimated that more than 700 young girls have been engulfed in the gigantic "white slave" ring operating in northern New Jersey and New York during the last year. These
                        girls, it is claimed, were actually sold to 200 "road houses" that were operated as efficiently as a chain of grocery stores. The girls were shifted from one dive to another on
                        alternate weeks.</ab>
                    <ab>When new girls were wanted, the "White Slave" Ring would advertise for girls to fill vari- ous domestic positions at attractive salaries; Those whose beauty of face and figure
                        marked them for their doom were snared and shown the "easy road" to a life of luxury.</ab>
                    <ab>But was it really the lure of a "life of luxury" that dragged these girls down to a life of shame? Or was it the hideous ruthlessness with which the ring operated? Or was it
                        perhaps some terrify- ing, mysterious influence which these monsters in human form had upon the minds of certain young women?</ab>
                    <ab>Such are some of the horrifying questions with which Richard E. Enright deals in his sensation- al series of articles on the "White Slave" Traffic. Commencing in the April
                        issue of Police Stories, Enright takes up every phase of this infamous commerce in hapless human beings. He traces the "traffic in souls" in New York from 1900 to the present
                        day and gives the public the full facts.</ab>
                    <ab>No mother or father who has a daughter, nor anyone who has a heartfelt interest in the welfare of any helpless, innocent young girl, can afford to miss a single page of these
                        astonishing disclos- ures. Enright has accepted the editorship of Police Stories so that he may continue to be of real service to New York. His series on the "White Slave"
                        Traffic is the first of many sensa- tional disclosures regarding social evils which he will try to eradicate.</ab>
                    <ab>Who murdered Dot King?</ab>
                    <ab>What strange facts are connected with the grue- some murder of Joseph Elwell?</ab>
                    <ab>Who was responsible for the horrible Wall Street Disaster?</ab>
