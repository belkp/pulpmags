No man can go </p><p>through the ordeal of i*re and </p><p>emerge unscathed. And to this </p><p>truth there are no real exceptions. A man </p><p>may be made by war, or he may be broken, </p><p>utterly and without redemption, but what- </p><p>ever happens neither he nor his point of </p><p>view will afterward be quite the same. </p><p> Some men will always be cowards in bat-</p><p>tle. Terror paralyzes their limbs and robs </p><p>their minds of all sense of shame. Merely </p><p>to die like soldiers is beyond their strength. </p><p>This is the one real argument against con- </p><p>scription, which takes all who are sound of </p><p>body, rejecting none: valuing quantity rath- </p><p>er than quality. </p><p> Others there are who know fear yet con-</p><p>quer it. The thought of death in all its </p><p>manifold forms—by bullet, by shell or by </p><p>bayonet—is terrible, yet far more terrible </p><p>is the thought of what men might say were </p><p>they to fail when wanted. Also, the man </p><p>who turns his back on the enemy has no </p><p>greater chance of safety than he who ad- </p><p>vances bravely. Why not, then, die as a </p><p>man should die, with honor? It is this feel- </p><p>ing that makes war possible at all. Many </p><p>things may be forgiven, but the one unfor- </p><p>givable sin is fear. </p><p> But even in these days when science has ’</p><p>forged instruments of d_^n}Ction so wicked </p><p>that the slaughter of bygone wars is as </p><p>nothing compared with the carnage of to- </p><p>day, there are men who can enter a battle </p><p>light of heart, seeking danger as the highest </p><p>earthly prize within their reach. And these </p><p>are the men who by sheer indifference to </p><p>death snatch victory from defeat. </p><p> Bravery as a virtue is confined to no one</p><p>nation, country or creed.

As they were in the past, so </p><p>are they now, prim and joyous lighters— </p><p>impatient, reckless, vengeful—in proof of </p><p>which many a hard-fought field in France </p><p>and Belgium, the gossip of trench and bil- </p><p>let, and the casualty lists, bear witness. </p><p>TONY MALLAGH was a subal- </p><p>tern in the South Irish. This state- </p><p>ment should explain a good deal; </p><p>for the South Irish are particular as to their </p><p>officers, as many a callow youth has learned </p><p>to his sorrow and dismay. </p><p> In looks and general appearance he was</p><p>not unlike any other rather ordinary young </p><p>man of six-and-twenty, who has spent most </p><p>of Ms life in the open, being lean and wiry </p><p>with a good-humored, sunburned face, and </p><p>eyes in which there seemed always to be</p><p>lurking a glint of laughter. But Tony Mal- </p><p>lagh was not an ordinary young man. Far </p><p>otherwise. He had faults, of course, as </p><p>have all of us. </p><p> But Tony Mallagh’s faults endeared him</p><p>to people no less than his virtues. He was </p><p>wofully improvident and a spendthrift, hav- </p><p>ing no sense of the value of money. He </p><p>bought for the mere pleasure of buying, and </p><p>mainly for the'beneiit of others. An appeal </p><p>for his help, in either time or cash, met </p><p>with a ready response. He never refused a </p><p>friend any request, which it might be in his </p><p>power to grant. He was charitable to a de- </p><p>gree of foolishness. He lent where there </p><p>was no prospect of any return. In times </p><p>of need, taking no thought for the future </p><p>he borrowed from a Jew money-lender in' </p><p>London, and when funds were more plenti- </p><p>ful, paid back the debt cheerfully. And if </p><p>to his mind the rate of interest charged for </p><p>the loan seemed exorbitant and out of all </p><p>proportion to the benefit received, he let it </p><p>pass unquestioned. An officer of the South </p><p>Irish could not, in common justice to him- </p><p>self and his calling, stoop to argument over </p><p>a matter of borrowed money. </p><p> For his poverty, however, Tony Mallagh</p><p>had no other than himself to thank. At </p><p>the age of eighteen his mother’s brother, a </p><p>hard-headed ship broker from Glasgow, had </p><p>offered to take him into his business and to </p><p>safeguard his interests as if he had been his </p><p>only son. This offer rejected on the in- </p><p>stant, lost Tony a fair chance of being a rich </p><p>man before he was forty. But there were </p><p> ued above mere wealth. As an alternative</p><p> to amassing a fortune he joined the army,</p><p> thereby entering on a career that seemed</p><p> particularly suited to his temperament.</p><p> His accomplishments were many and such</p><p> as earned him the respect of his fellow sub-</p><p> alterns. He excelled in sport of every de-</p><p> scription. He had played Rugby football</p><p> for his country, he was as good a shot with</p><p> a rifle as any man in the regiment, there</p><p> was no horse that he would not ride, or at</p><p> least try to, and he had boxed as a light-</p><p> weight in the public-school championships</p><p> at Aldershot. Moreover, he was absolutely</p><p> without fear, and had never been known to</p><p> lose his temper save on one occasion, fa-</p><p> mous in the annals of the regiment.</p><p> This was soon after he had joined the</p><p> First Battalion, when he had fought and de-</p><p> cisively beaten a brawny greengrocer in</p><p> Commercial Road, Portsmouth, simply be-</p><p> cause the said greengrocer, being somewhat</p><p> exhilarated by strong drink, chose to assert</p><p> his prerogative as a Briton by slugging his</p><p> weed of a horse over the head with the butt</p><p> of his whip. Tony had interfered. The</p><p> fight was the natural outcome. When the</p><p> greengrocer, a head taller and perhaps four-</p><p> teen or so pounds heavier, had been count-</p><p> ed out by an enthusiastic crowd of blue-</p><p> jackets, and the police had interfered, and</p><p> there was every prospect of a fair-sized riot</p><p> being brought about by the loser’s friends</p><p> and supporters, Tony had settled the mat-</p><p> ter by offering to purchase the horse and</p><p> wagon on the spot. The offer was prompt-</p><p> ly accepted.</p><p>■v This was the reason why ten minutes later </p><p> Tony’s commanding officer, motoring to-</p><p> ward Cosham with his wife, had been struck</p><p> almost speechless by the spectacle of his</p><p> youngest subaltern, barehm*Ld and looking</p><p> slightly the worse for wear, seated on the</p><p> front of a dilapidated greengrocer’s wagon</p><p> with a policeman by his side, driving a de-</p><p> jected white horse.</p><p> “Mr. Mallagh,” said the Colonel in</p><p> mild astonishment, “Mr. Mallagh, may I</p><p> ask-”</p><p> “It’s all right, sir,” said Tony blandly,</p><p> “we’re just taking this old horse to be de-</p><p> stroyed.”</p><p> “But, really, Mr. Mallagh, do you think</p><p> that a greengrocer’s wagon is er—quite a</p><p> suitable vehicle? Wouldn’t it be as well to</p><p> er—allow the constable to take charge of</p><p>Lieutenant Tony Mallagh </p><p>5 </p><p>the horse alone, without your er—valuable </p><p>assistance?” </p><p> Fortunately none of the spectators of the</p><p>fight knew that Tony was an officer in the </p><p>South Irish; fortunately also the Colonel </p><p>happened to be possessed of feelings some- </p><p>what akin to Tony’s own. So the matter </p><p>was dropped. But, so he was told, Tony </p><p>was never to do anything of the kind again. </p><p>Officers of His Majesty’s Army must not </p><p>fight in the streets as though they were or- </p><p>dinary mortals. It is not fitting. But the </p><p>story having leaked out followed Tony out </p><p>to India and home again when he was trans- </p><p>ferred to the Second Battalion, and was re- </p><p>lated as typical of himself and his methods. </p><p> Tony, indeed, was unpractical, a vision-</p><p>ary, rather given to acting without thought </p><p>and apt to be led away by a far-fetched </p><p>sense of humor. His smile won him friends </p><p>where others found only coldness and hos- </p><p>tility. He made no enemies, and his men</p><p>adored him. Also, though more or less </p><p>poor, he was always happy. </p><p> For the rest, he was Irish, hailing from</p><p>County Kerry, and in love with the sweet- </p><p>est and dearest girl in the world, as poor and </p><p>as proud as himself, who lived with an aunt, </p><p>the widow of a retired admiral, in a small </p><p>house at Farnborough, within easy reach of </p><p>the North Camp where Tony was stationed </p><p>in the Spring of the year, 1914. </p><p> Marriage is not a risk to be entered on</p><p>lightly. For six months Tony Mallagh, </p><p>rendered strangely cautious by his good for- </p><p>tune, waited until such time as his finances </p><p>showed signs of improvement. But at the </p><p>end c [ the six months, an interminable age, </p><p>his j atience was worn threadbare. The </p><p>novelty and charm of being engaged, even </p><p>though it were to the sweetest and dearest </p><p>of girls, was slightly dimmed. </p><p> As a general rule, Tony, thn—, having a</p><p>host of friends, was disinclined to consult </p><p>any regarding his own affairs. Neverthe- </p><p>less he felt now that he needed advice. </p><p>There was only one man in the whole regi- </p><p>ment to whom he could go: Shannon, his </p><p>company commander, and his senior by </p><p>about ten years. </p><p> Tony’s attitude of mind toward Shannon</p><p>was peculiar. He admired him for what he </p><p>was and for what he had done as a soldier. </p><p>He had medals for the Tirah expedition in </p><p>’97, the Soudan in ’98, the Boer War, So- </p><p>maliland, for the northwest frontier six </p><p>years before, in addition the D. S. O., </p><p>earned in Natal on the way to Ladysmith. </p><p>He was a disciplinarian. B Company was </p><p>the smartest in the battalion. He was sin- </p><p>cere, kindly, clever. Yet from Tony Mal- </p><p>lagh’s view-point he had his failings. He </p><p>was deliberate, slow in understanding, over </p><p>methodical, particular as to detail, fussy </p><p>and, as all confirmed bachelors must at last </p><p>be, old-maidish in his tastes. But his judg- </p><p>ments were to be relied on. He would say </p><p>what he thought, making no effort to hide </p><p>his opinion, favorable or not. </p><p> So to Shannon, Tony went one morning</p><p>after parade and stated his case. That </p><p>Shannon was a man who knew nothing of </p><p>women, who was commonly reported to de- </p><p>spise the sex, was no drawback. His ad- </p><p>vice would be free from prejudice, one way </p><p>or the other. Also he knew Sybil’s aunt, </p><p>and Sybil as well. </p><p> Shannon, a big man with black hair and</p><p>a small, close-clipped black mustache, sat in </p><p>an armchair, smoking a pipe, his eyes half-</p><p>closed, his square-jawed face giving no clue </p><p>to what thoughts he might have. Yet Tony </p><p>was strangely comforted even by the knowl- </p><p>edge that he listened. </p><p> “So you see how things are, sir! What</p><p>oughc I to do? It’s rotten luck on the girl, </p><p>you know, to be engaged to a fat-headed </p><p>chump like I am. Lord! We may drift on </p><p>in this kind of way for about fifteen years, </p><p>or more, till I’m a Major, if I ever get that </p><p>far. I’ll never have any more money than </p><p>I have now, apart from my pay, I’m cer- </p><p>tain. And what’s that to a girl as ripping, </p><p>and as good as Sybil? Nothing—nothing at </p><p>all. I know, from—well, just from know- </p><p>ing her, that she’d marry me on what I have </p><p>now. But would it be fair? Would it be </p><p>playing the game?” </p><p> Shannon frowned and looked if anything</p><p>rather bored. </p><p> “She’s promised to marry you, has she—</p><p>some time or other, eh?” </p><p> “Rather!” said Tony.</p><p> “Said anything to any one?”</p><p> “No, sir. You see—well, we’ve kept it a</p><p>secret for many reasons.” </p><p> “Ah! And no one knows?”</p><p> “Not a blessed soul!” Tony waited, won-</p><p>dering at the drift of the questions that were </p><p>asked. “Of course, sir, I might try and ex- </p><p>change into something that’s better paid </p><p>than the line: the A. S. C., or the Army </p><p>Ordnance, for instance. Or I could get out </p><p>to Egypt, perhaps, or West Africa, or-” </p><p>6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Shannon leaned forward suddenly.</p><p> “What’s that? What’s that you say?</p><p>Leave the South Irish! Tony, you’re a fool! </p><p>You can do one thing, so far as I can see, </p><p>and only one. I know your fiancee—er— </p><p>well enough to er—realize that if she loves—” </p><p>the word seemed to worry him—“if she er— </p><p>cares for you, Tony, and you say she does, </p><p>money will play only a small part in the er— </p><p>affair. Poor! Of course you are, and al- </p><p>ways will be. Even if you had a million, </p><p>you’d be hard up.” He grunted. “Huh! </p><p>Leave the battalion, indeed! Not if I know </p><p>it.” </p><p> “Then you think I ought to marry soon.”</p><p> “At once, if you can.” He hoisted him-</p><p>self out of his chair and stretched out his </p><p>arms and yawned. “And now, get out! I’m </p><p>sick and tired of hearing you talk.” </p><p> Tony grinned and stood up.</p><p> “It’s jolly good of you, sir, to have both-</p><p>ered. It is, really.”</p><p> “Get out!” repeated Shannon gruffly.</p><p>“Don’t worry me!” </p><p> By his manner he seemed to regard the</p><p>interview as of no importance, or as merely </p><p>a waste of time that might be otherwise </p><p>more usefully employed. But when Tony </p><p>had closed the door after him, he dropped </p><p>into his chair once more and stared blindly </p><p>across the little room, a dull pain in his </p><p>heart and his teeth pressing deeply into his </p><p>lower lip. </p><p> It seemed impossible. Had his pride been</p><p>so great that he had been unable to see what </p><p>was passing before his very eyes? Had </p><p>others seen and he been ignorant of open </p><p>warnings? The girl he had thought to </p><p>marry, the one girl in the whole world a </p><p>man might worship unashamed, had been </p><p>taken from him by Tony Mallagh. Tony, </p><p>the irresponsible, extravagant, happy-go- </p><p>lucky, reckless, hard-up Tony, had beaten </p><p>him. </p><p> And Sybil! In the depths of his despair</p><p>there yet remained a feeling of thankful- </p><p>ness that he had been spared the shame of </p><p>hearing from her own lips what he now </p><p>knew. </p><p> He rose from his chair and stood gazing</p><p>out of the window on to the barrack square. </p><p>A sense of his own worthlessness gripped </p><p>him. What right had he to hope that a girl </p><p>like Sybil would have chosen a man like </p><p>himself: a man with no knowledge beyond </p><p>the Army; a man who could sit tongue-tied </p><p>and half-frightened in her presence? The </p><p>thought of his own conceit—which he would </p><p>have hated in another—sickened him. </p><p> But it was all over now and done with.</p><p>Sybil would marry Tony Mallagh, and they </p><p>woi Id be very happy together and very </p><p>poor, and he himself, Captain R. B. Shan- </p><p>non, D. S. O., Second Battalion, Royal </p><p>South Irish Fusiliers, would work hard and </p><p>hope for war and try and put out of his </p><p>mind the picture of the girl whom he had </p><p>thought his for the mere asking. </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>LOVE, AND A RUMOR OF WAR </p><p>NOT even Tony Mallagh, reckless and </p><p>improvident as he was, would have </p><p>risked marriage, had not matters taken an </p><p>unexpected turn. It was while lie was in </p><p>Ireland, on leave, that he read of the death </p><p>of Sybil’s aunt. He left for Aldershot the </p><p>same evening. </p><p> The girl, dressed in deep black, was in</p><p>the garden at the back of the house when </p><p>he arrived.</p><p> “Sybil,” he said presently, after the first</p><p>greetings were over, “what do you intend </p><p>to do?” </p><p> She gave a little shrug.</p><p> “I don’t know, Tony. I’ve got to earn a</p><p>living somehow, of course.” </p><p> “Oh!” said Tony sagely. “Indeed. Just</p><p>so. Earn a living.” He looked at her with </p><p>loving admiration. </p><p> “You sec, dear,” said the girl, “Aunt</p><p>Tane’s income was for life only. And—well, </p><p>t lat’s all gone. So I must do something, </p><p>n.ustn’t I?” He said nothing and she con- </p><p>tinued, “I’m fairly clever at housekeeping, I </p><p>can look after servants, keep accounts, gar- </p><p>den, and so on, so I thought T might be use- </p><p>ful as a companion to some oiitrr-x^r a govern- </p><p>ess, or-” </p><p> Tony interrupted with a grunt signifying</p><p>extreme disapproval and disgust. </p><p> “Quite so. A governess, eh! Ye-es. I</p><p>can just see you governessing, sweetheart. </p><p>Quite so. You’ve no people at all, dear </p><p>have you?” </p><p> “Only a sister in Dublin. Her husband’s</p><p>in the engineers. I could go to her for a </p><p>while, but—well, she’s not very well off, </p><p>and it’s better for me to do something for </p><p>myself, isn’t it?” </p><p> “No,” said Tony decidedly. “It isn’t—</p><p>nothing of the kind. Ridiculous! Wouldn’t </p><p>Lieutenant Tony Mallagh </p><p>7 </p><p> hear of it. Sybil, my love, let us consider</p><p> the facts. Why put off any longer what</p><p> might be done now?”</p><p> She watched him in silence, the sunshine</p><p> makirg her hair like spun gold, her blue</p><p> eyes, blue as the sky above, very grave and</p><p> tender and loving, her cheeks flushed, a lit-</p><p> tle nervous smile on her lips.</p><p> “Sweetheart,” said Tony, “we’ve nothing</p><p> to lose by marriage. Nothing. All to gain.</p><p> I’m sick of this everlasting waiting. At</p><p> this rate we won’t be married for fifty</p><p> years, not if we’re supposed to be waiting</p><p> till I can give you what you deserve. Con-</p><p> sider the facts, old girl, and decide. What’s</p><p> more, if the money I have now can keep me,</p><p>*	throwing it about like I do and not trying</p><p> to save, it’ll keep the pair of us. That’s</p><p> logic. We’d be poor, of course, but—will</p><p> you risk it? Could you marry a poor man,</p><p> Sybil dear, and be happy?”</p><p> “It’s not myself I’m worried about,” she</p><p> said slowly, “it’s you. I’ve always been</p><p> poor, but it will be hard on you, Tony, to</p><p> have to give up-”</p><p> “Rubbish and fiddlesticks!” said Tony.</p><p> He took her into his arms and kissed her.</p><p> “If that’s all, sweetheart, we’ll be married</p><p> just as soon as we jolly well can. I’ll tackle</p><p> the Colonel first thing in the morning. You</p><p> leave it to me. He won’t mind when I tell</p><p> him everything, I know. He’s eating out</p><p> of my hand these days. Tame as a white</p><p> rabbit with some green-stuff.”</p><p> And, allowing for exaggeration, Tony was</p><p> quite correct. Married subalterns were not</p><p> approved of in the South Irish for many</p><p> reasc is, but for once the Colonel raised no</p><p> obje&lt; tions.</p><p> “In your case,” he said, “I think it’s al-</p><p> most the best thing that could have hap-</p><p> pened. You’ve made a most excellent</p><p> choice—most excellent. And, s~^ny, if I</p><p> were you I’d leave all my financial affairs to</p><p> my wife. From what I know there’s more</p><p> sense in that young lady’s little finger than</p><p> there is in your whole body. Now run</p><p> along and get married as soon as you</p><p> please.”</p><p> And married they were within the month.</p><p> Quite the most valuable of their many</p><p> presents came from Shannon, who, much to</p><p> his regret, was called up to London on busi-</p><p> ness on the very morning of the wedding.</p><p> This was in the middle of June.</p><p> For a little over five weeks Tony lived in</p><p> a kind of dream in which fact and fancy</p><p>seemed strangely mingled. Never before </p><p>had he known such happiness. Never in- </p><p>deed had he thought such happiness possi- </p><p>ble. Sybil was wonderful. Each day that </p><p>passed revealed in her unexpected charms. </p><p> Deep down in his heart Tony pitied those</p><p>less fortunate than himself: not only bache- </p><p>lors, but men with wives less lovely, or less </p><p>perfect than his wife. For, after all, as he </p><p>well knew, there was only one Sybil. How </p><p>he had existed without her puzzled him. </p><p> But if marriage brought to him happi-</p><p>ness, so also it brought fear. Supposing he </p><p>were to die, what would become of Sybil? </p><p>The thought of the future, with all its possi- </p><p>bilities of disaster, daunted him. He must </p><p>make provision, certainly. But how? This </p><p>was the problem that, try as he might, he </p><p>could not solve. </p><p> Shannon met him one day walking slow-</p><p>ly across the parade-ground toward the </p><p>mess. </p><p> “Tony,” he said, “wliat’s wrong?”</p><p> Tony came to himself with a start.</p><p>“What’s that? Hullo, sir, never saw you. </p><p>Wrong! Nothing.” And as if to prove his</p><p>words he smiled with the utmost good na- </p><p>ture. </p><p> Shannon shook his head.</p><p> “Known you too long, now, old son, not</p><p>to know when you’re worrying. How’s the </p><p>wife? Quite fit, eh?” </p><p> “Rather!” said Tony.</p><p> “Well, something’s troubling you, I know.</p><p>Tell it a mile off.” </p><p> “Thinking,” Tony laughed. “That’s</p><p>all.” </p><p> “Shouldn’t do it too often, then. Bad</p><p>for you.” He hesitated. “Finances all </p><p>right?” </p><p> “Yes—so far as it goes. Sometimes one</p><p>doesn’t see clearly. You know, the future </p><p>and all that kind of tiling. But I’m not </p><p>worrying.” A sudden thought flashed </p><p>through Tony’s mind. “You don’t notice </p><p>that I’ve changed at all, do you, since I </p><p>married. Because I haven’t. Not in the </p><p>very least.” He wanted that much to be </p><p>understood plainly. </p><p> “Changed!” said Shannon. “No. Why</p><p>the dickens should you be changed?” </p><p> “I’m glad of that,” said Tony. Then for</p><p>no particular reason he added: “I think if </p><p>anything happened to Sybil. I should— </p><p>well, I don’t know what I should do.” </p><p> Shannon stared at him without comment</p><p>and passed on. </p><p>8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>THERE came an evening soon after </p><p>when a certain rumor, that owed its </p><p>origin to a shot fired in the streets </p><p>of a town in far-off Bosnia, reached the </p><p>mess of the Royal South Irish Fusiliers. </p><p> All through dinner the tide of talk had</p><p>ebbed and flowed in well-worn channels. </p><p>No trace of care or worry for the future </p><p>showed on the faces of those gathered </p><p>around the long table under the shaded </p><p>lights. Life offered to man nothing of more </p><p>importance than sport in all its branches, </p><p>hunting, fishing, racing, shooting, golf, or </p><p>the theater, perhaps, or London, or leave in </p><p>the Autumn when the year’s training should </p><p>be finished. As if by instinct, all mention </p><p>of any topic dealing with the army was </p><p>avoided. </p><p> But when the last of the mess waiters,</p><p>stolid privates of the regiment, had left the </p><p>room, there was a sudden silence. </p><p> The Colonel, broad and thick^set and</p><p>gray as a badger, a string of medals adorn- </p><p>ing his scarlet mess-jacket, a bone-white </p><p>scar on his forehead, bearing witness to the</p><p>skill of a Boer marksman at Inniskilling </p><p>Hill, leaned back in his chair and glanced </p><p>from side to side through half closed eye- </p><p>lids. </p><p> “Well,” he said after a while, “it looks</p><p>like the real thing at last. Or doesn’t </p><p>it?” </p><p> Came, the senior Major, nodded. “Don’t</p><p>see how they can keep out. Not Germany; </p><p>not Russia. And where’s it to end, eh?” </p><p> “We’re not ready for war, of e^rse,” said</p><p>one of the other majors. “We never are. </p><p>Yet, maybe, the first thing we know, we’ll </p><p>be fighting!” </p><p> Tony Mallagh, who was dining in mess,</p><p>growled: </p><p> “And just because a maniac at the other</p><p>side of Europe puts a bullet into some one </p><p>we’ve never heard of! All the same, it’ull </p><p>be a good job for Ireland if it does come. </p><p>Any war’s better than civil war.” Shannon </p><p>looked at him curiously. “But,” and he </p><p>went on with a little laugh, “we won’t fight, </p><p>of course. This Government of ours isn’t </p><p>going to let itself be dragged into a war just </p><p>on account of a little nation like Serbia be- </p><p>ing wiped out, is it? We’ll stay out and </p><p>sell goods, ammunition and guns and under- </p><p>vests and boot-laces and tracts and whisky </p><p>to both sides.” 1 </p><p> “And you, Shannon,” said O* Colonel,</p><p>“what do you say, eh?” </p><p> “I don’t think, sir, I know. It’s a war,</p><p>that’s certain. The biggest thing that ever </p><p>happened.” </p><p> In [the anteroom afterward the Mess re-</p><p>solved itself into a committee of public </p><p>safety for the defense of the realm, and </p><p>sought knowledge from books of reference, </p><p>the army list and many maps. </p><p> To Tony Mallagh, seated as far as possi-</p><p>ble from the chattering groups, a volume of </p><p>the Encyclopedia Britannica in his lap, </p><p>came Shannon, hands in pockets, a grim </p><p>smile on his lips. </p><p> He dropped into a chair beside him.</p><p> “I’m looking up the habits and customs</p><p>of the Serbs,” said Tony. “Curiosity, that’s </p><p>all.” </p><p> “Shouldn’t worry about Serbia,” said</p><p>Shannon. “Try under B.” </p><p> “Why B?”</p><p> “Belgium.”</p><p> “Oh!” said Tony. “Do you mean—you</p><p>don’t think, sir, that—” He closed the </p><p>book. “You don’t mean to tell me the </p><p>Germans will invade Belgium to get at </p><p>France?”</p><p> “Why not?” said Shannon.</p><p> “Then,” said Tony miserably, “I don’t</p><p>see how even this fool of a Government can </p><p>keep from fighting. Good Lord!” </p><p> Shannon was troubled in his mind. How</p><p>would he himself, supposing he were in </p><p>Tony’s shoes—a married man, married less </p><p>than two months—bear the news that miglit </p><p>send him across the Channel to the biggest </p><p>war the world had ever seen? </p><p> “It’s war, at last, then,” said Tony in a</p><p>low voice. </p><p> “Afraid so,” said Shannon. “It’s hard</p><p>011 you, though—awful hard.” </p><p> Tony straightened lw;self with a jerk</p><p>and thrust two fingers between his collar </p><p>and neck as if choking. </p><p> “Yes, it’s hard,” he said. “As a matter</p><p>of fact, sir, I’d been thinking a good deal </p><p>lately of the things that might happen: </p><p>sickness, illness, accidents, and so on. Mar- </p><p>riage makes a man think, somehow. But </p><p>about the only thing I didn’t think of was </p><p>war. I want to see some fighting some time </p><p>or other, of course. Who doesn’t? But—” </p><p>he uttered a hard laugh—“rather rough </p><p>luck, isn’t it, coming at this particular </p><p>time ?” </p><p> A voice hailed them.</p><p> “Here, Shannon, you’re an expert. See if</p><p>you can figure tins out. And what’s the </p><p>Lieutenant Tony Mallagh </p><p>9 </p><p>matter with Tony Mallagh? He looks as if </p><p>he’d committed a particularly beastly mur- </p><p>der, or lozl his platoon, like he did last </p><p>Thursday. Tony, dearest, what is it? Ickle </p><p>pain in ’oo tummy? Tell nursey!” </p><p> Tony laughed, and with that the worry</p><p>passed off, not'to return until he was back </p><p>in his own home with Sybil, descending the </p><p>stairs. </p><p> “Sybil,” he said, “I’ve something to tell</p><p>you. Something rather important.” </p><p>“Nothing wrong, is there?” she asked. </p><p>Tony nodded, and she led the way into </p><p>the drawing-room. </p><p> “Well, dear, what is it? Don’t be afraid!”</p><p>she said quietly. </p><p> She stood by the table, very slim and</p><p>erect, and looking lovelier than ever. </p><p> “Sybil, I’ve bad news for you, dear, about</p><p>the regiment. Dearest, there’s going to be </p><p>a war in Europe, and they think we’ll have </p><p>to fight.” </p><p> “The South Irish!”</p><p> “Yes.” The thought of what she must</p><p>suffer rose up to stifle him.</p><p> “If they send you, dear, you must go,</p><p>mustn’t you? It’s duty, isn’t it? And </p><p>you’re worried, you poor boy, because of </p><p>me!” She kissed him lightly, “Poor old </p><p>Tony! You mustn’t. Why, Tony, you </p><p>don’t mean to say you think me a coward!” </p><p>Her laugh sounded almost happy. “Tony, </p><p>you’re forgetting I’m the daughter of a sol- </p><p>dier, as well as being the wife of one. I’m </p><p>not frightened, love—not in the least.” </p><p>“You darling!” said Tony. “I think </p><p>you’re the bravest girl alive—and the most </p><p>beautiful. I was almost afraid of telling </p><p>you.” </p><p> “Oh!” said the girl. “As far as that goes,</p><p>we were talking it over tonight at dinner, </p><p>Mrs. Carne and I. Besides jl . been think- </p><p>ing for the last day or so we might have </p><p>war. If we fight, well and good. It can’t </p><p>be helped, can it? And I wouldn’t have you </p><p>hold back, Tony, or feel that marriage made </p><p>you any less of a soldier, for all the money </p><p>in the world.” </p><p> And after that Tony Mallagh put from</p><p>him all thoughts of worry or gloom. The </p><p>future could take care of itself. If the </p><p>South Irish Fusiliers were sent to the war, </p><p>if there were a war at all, he could go, light- </p><p>heartedly, free from anxiety, knowing that </p><p>Sybil wished him to fight and to fight his </p><p>hardest, and what could a man want more </p><p>than that? </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>GOOD-BY </p><p>ITHIN the wTeek war was declared and </p><p>there followed days of wony and end- </p><p>less labor for those in authority: suppressed </p><p>excitement, feverish activity, much drilling </p><p>of reservists, musketry, field days, inocula- </p><p>tion, inspections, with a vague undercur- </p><p>rent of emotion apparent throughout the </p><p>whole regiment. Rumors abounded, both </p><p>in the officers’ mess and the men’s canteen. </p><p> Imperceptibly but surely the bonds of</p><p>discipline tightened. The Colonel, so it was </p><p>said, was feeling the reins, and the regiment </p><p>responded. The number of defaulters grew </p><p>all of a sudden beautifully less, even the </p><p>most confirmed of offenders became cau- </p><p>tious, drunkenness decreased as by some </p><p>miracle, nor was it that the non-commis- </p><p>sioned officers turned blind eyes on those </p><p>who fell from the path of virtue. If this </p><p>were war, war that would bring to the South </p><p>Irish much honor and glory and more fight- </p><p>ing than even an Irish regiment had ever </p><p>dreamed of, then was it necessary that each </p><p>man should take the field ready and fit to</p><p>do credit to himself and his battalion. Also, </p><p>from the point of view of the rank and file, </p><p>it behooved the mere private to walk warily </p><p>lest when the order came, he should be left </p><p>alone, at home, confined to cells, doomed to </p><p>inaction and misery, while others more vir- </p><p>tuous, fought and perchance died. </p><p> The time for good-bys drew near. Shan-</p><p>non, busy with the affairs of his company, </p><p>had seen little of Tony Mallagh for some </p><p>days, save in the presence of others, or on </p><p>duty. </p><p> Then, one afternoon, Tony overtook him</p><p>and said that Sybil was leaving for London </p><p>the next morning and would he come up to </p><p>the house, if he could spare half-an-hour or </p><p>so, to say good-by. </p><p> “Yes,” said Shannon. “Yes, certainly.</p><p>Very glad.” </p><p> “She said she’d like to see you,” con-</p><p>tinued Tony, “and I’ve been so rushed </p><p>lately I never thought anything more about </p><p>it until today. You see, we decided it would </p><p>be better for her not to be here when the </p><p>regiment leaves. She didn’t want it. No </p><p>more did I. Too depressing. And she’s </p><p>going to stay with Mrs. Carne in London.” </p><p>So that evening Shannon sat in the small, </p><p>bare drawing-room, by the tall window that </p><p>10 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>opened on to the lawn, while the girl, wrap- </p><p>ped in a big white cloak—for the night air </p><p>was cool—talked lightly as one without </p><p>care. </p><p> It was not until Tony, whistling cheerful-</p><p>ly, growling about his kit, went off and left </p><p>them together, that she told why it was she </p><p>had sent for him. </p><p> "It’s very good of you to come, Captain</p><p>Shannon,” she said quietly. "I wanted to </p><p>ask you a favor.” </p><p> “Anything I can do, Mrs. Mallagh, I</p><p>will.” </p><p> “I'm leaving tomorrow,” she said, “and</p><p>this is the last time I’ll see you-” </p><p> “Till er—we come back,” put in Shannon.</p><p>“Till we er—come back, eh?” </p><p> “When will that be? There’s always the</p><p>‘when/ Captain Shannon, isn’t there?” For </p><p>a while she was silent. </p><p> From the road there came the sound of</p><p>some one whistling. In the distance a train </p><p>rumbled through the night, bound perhaps </p><p>to tide-water with troops. The breeze whis- </p><p>pered in the leaves of the trees, bearing </p><p>with it the scent of roses. The clear notes </p><p>of a bugle sounded faintly from the direc-</p><p>tion of the North Camp. </p><p> “Captain Shannon,” said the girl sudden-</p><p>ly, “the regiment, you and the rest, are go- </p><p>ing to fight. That's as it should be. No </p><p>woman worth her salt would wish for any- </p><p>thing else.” </p><p> “It’s hard on the married men,” said</p><p>Shannon gruffly. - hard! I beg your </p><p>pardon, Airs. Mallagh—inexcusable.” </p><p> “It’s not easy for us women,” she con-</p><p>tinued in a low voice. “But that doesn’t </p><p>alter facts, does it? And if we are to fight, </p><p>why—we must fight our best. It’s the wait- </p><p>ing that tries one, I know, wailing until </p><p>there’s a telegram, or a letter, or even a line </p><p>in the paper and we learn that what we </p><p>feared has happened, and—and life isn’t </p><p>worth living any more.’- For an instant a </p><p>shade of worry showed in the blue eyes. “I </p><p>remember when 1 was only a small girl, my </p><p>eldest brother, twenty-one he was, was kill- </p><p>ed at Spion Kop—you were there with the </p><p>regiment,, weren’t you? And we saw his </p><p>name in the paper before the wire arrived </p><p>from the War Office. Breakfast-time it was, </p><p>and mother-" </p><p> She stopped and her fingers plucked idly</p><p>at the white fur on her cloak. </p><p> “But it doesn’t do any good to think of</p><p>w'hat might happen. That’s why 1 in al- </p><p>ways so cheerful; Tony, too. Thinking </p><p>makes you imagine things, and then they </p><p>happen.” </p><p> “You mustn’t talk like that, Mrs. Mal-</p><p>lagh,” said Shannon, “it’s not right. Why </p><p>—good Lord! Don’t you understand that </p><p>—that-” </p><p> He, in his turn, broke off, helpless to say</p><p>what should be said. </p><p> She shook her head.</p><p> “Don’t think, for one moment, that I’d</p><p>keep him at home, even if I had the power, </p><p>or that—that I think he’s going to die. I </p><p>don’t. But, Captain Shannon—” she lean- </p><p>ed forward in her chair, and her eyes sought </p><p>his as if seeking some ray of hope or com- </p><p>fort—“listen! I know he’ll come back to </p><p>me, I feel it, but I can’t help being a little </p><p>anxious. I can’t really, though I try not </p><p>to.” </p><p> “Well!” said Shannon doubtfully.</p><p> “What I wanted to ask you was: Would</p><p>you just keep an eye on Tony when he gets </p><p>out to the front, and pull him up if you </p><p>think he’s deliberately trying to get him- </p><p>self killed!” She gave a little laugh. </p><p> Shannon stared at her in dumb ix-wilder-</p><p>ment. Did she think he could help? Did</p><p>she think that it was within his power or </p><p>the power of any mortal to save her husband </p><p>from harm? Had she no idea what war was </p><p>or meant? The very calmness of her words </p><p>and her steady smile was an added mystery. </p><p> “Of course I know that he’s got to run</p><p>into danger. I want him to. He’s got to </p><p>prove himself as good as the best. I want </p><p>to be proud of him. But you know what </p><p>Tony is. He’s foolish in some ways. He’s </p><p>never seen any fighting yet, and he’s bound </p><p>to be reckless over it, just to show that he’s </p><p>brave, so I thought that if you could give </p><p>him a word of advice it might help him.” </p><p>She raised her eyebrows. “You don’t think </p><p>I’m panicky, do you. Captain Shannon? </p><p>I’m not. I’m not even worrying. But— </p><p>he’s all I’ve got in the world, and—well, if </p><p>he went, life wouldn’t be worth the trouble </p><p>of living.” </p><p> A deep pity swept over Shannon, but he</p><p>did not speak. </p><p> “You’re not angry with me, Captain</p><p>Shannon?” she asked. </p><p> “Angry! Of course not.’’</p><p> “I asked you because you’ve been a friend</p><p>to him, and—’’ she hesitated, her cheeks </p><p>flaming—“and a friend to me, also.’’ </p><p> A friend! The word seemed to mock him.</p><p> .</p><p>&lt;A friend! And somehow the old heartache </p><p>|and longing that he had imagined put aside </p><p>forever, came back. He himself had suf- </p><p>fered, far more than he had thought possi- </p><p>ble. So, now, he could feel the agony that </p><p>gripped the girl seated by the open window </p><p>—the girl he had once hoped to make his </p><p>wife. If Tony died, she would lose every- </p><p>thing life had to offer. She said as much </p><p>herself. </p><p> “I’ll do my best," he said quietly.</p><p>“Thank you,” she said. “I knew you </p><p>would.” </p><p> There were footsteps in the hall, and</p><p>Tony entered. </p><p> “Hope you didn’t think I was neglecting</p><p>you, sir. I’ve been working over the ever- </p><p>lasting problem of packing my kit. How </p><p>on earth do they expect us to manage with </p><p>only thirty-seven pounds of baggage, eh?” </p><p>Shannon dragged his wandering thoughts </p><p>out of the future to the present. </p><p> “You either leave half what you want</p><p>behind, or else you start off to the war with </p><p>about a hundredweight of stuff strapped on </p><p>to you beside what you’ve got to carry al- </p><p>ready.” </p><p> “Lord! I’m no blighted dromedary.</p><p>And think of the looks of the thing. I want </p><p>to look like a soldier, not like a traveling </p><p>tinker. Bad for the illustrated papers, too. </p><p>Special attraction: double-page photograph </p><p>from the front, ‘Charge of the South Irish’ </p><p>spoiled by honorable self in foreground, car- </p><p>rying a portable bath-tub, and a pair of </p><p>waders, and a gramaphone, on my back, </p><p>and encouraging my brave lads to go on </p><p>without me, waving a fishing-rod in one </p><p>hand and the parrot's cage in the other. </p><p>Not a nice thought, is it? And I couldn’t </p><p>really charge, carrying everything I ought </p><p>to take with me, could I?” </p><p> “You’ll excuse him, Captain Shannon,</p><p>I’m sure. He’s not often taken like that. </p><p>We try and keep it quiet. Sad, isn’t it?” </p><p>Shannon laughed and stood up. </p><p> '‘1 must go now, I’m afraid.”</p><p> Sybil was also standing, smiling as if they</p><p>had been discussing the most unimportant </p><p>topics imaginable. </p><p> “Good-by, then, and thank you very</p><p>much, indeed. You’ll write sometimes, </p><p>won’t you? You won’t forget, will you?” </p><p>“Rather not. Only too delighted.” </p><p>She held out a small hand. “Good-by, </p><p>then. And we’ll meet after the war is over!” </p><p>“Tell you what,” said Tony with sudden </p><p>II </p><p>enthusiasm, “we’ll all have dinner to- </p><p>gether in London as soon as we get back. </p><p>At the Savoy or the Carlton. Sybil, you </p><p>won’t forget, will you? Or—or if we’re all </p><p>broke by that time, the cabman’s shelter at </p><p>Hyde Park Comer." </p><p> “Right,” said Shannon gravely. “Mind,</p><p>that’s settled. And we’ll go to the theater </p><p>afterward.” </p><p> As he closed the gate of the front garden</p><p>and turned away he saw Tony and the girl </p><p>standing in the doorway side by side, sil- </p><p>houetted against the light. He wondered </p><p>as he waved his hand what bitterness and </p><p>sorrow good-by might mean for them. Less </p><p>than two months of marriage and then the </p><p>parting. </p><p> And for once Shannon could feel glad</p><p>that he at least left no one to mourn his </p><p>going. </p><p> TWO days later, very early in the</p><p>morning, the Second Battalion of </p><p>the Royal South Irish Fusiliers </p><p>swung out of barracks and down the white </p><p>road that led to the station and the battle- </p><p>fields of Belgium. And the tune to which </p><p>they marched, played by the drums and fifes </p><p>wras “Garry OwTen,” a tune to which their</p><p>forbears had set out nearly a hundred years </p><p>before on a like errand of mercy. </p><p> As they passed through the village, men</p><p>and women came to the door of the houses, </p><p>window's were thrown open and heads thm*t </p><p>forth, and, as if sprung into existence from </p><p>nowhere, a swarm of small boys kept pace </p><p>with the band. The men, marching at ease, </p><p>laughed and joked their good-bys. </p><p> Shannon, picking up the old familiar land-</p><p>marks with his eyes, listening to the shrill </p><p>whimper of the fifes, saw standing by the </p><p>front of a small shop, apart from the people, </p><p>a girl wrapped in a long coat. </p><p> Something about her seemed vaguely fa-</p><p>miliar. Tony Mallagh marching with the </p><p>platoon immediately ahead had halted and </p><p>was waiting for him to come abreast. </p><p> He quickened his pace.</p><p> “Tony,” he said, “there’s Sybil!"</p><p> “What!” Tony uttered a little exclama-</p><p>tion of despair, then making his way </p><p>through the crowd reached the girl in the </p><p>long coat. </p><p> “Sybil,” he whispered. “You shouldn’t</p><p>have. Why did you?" </p><p> She held out her hands and smiled.</p><p> “I had to.”</p><p>Lieutenant Tony Mallagh </p><p>w </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Whether people were watching or not</p><p>made no difference now. He drew her to </p><p>him and kissed her. </p><p> “I just had to,” she said. “But I never</p><p>intended that you should see me, Tony. </p><p>Never.” </p><p> ‘ My dear, my dear!”</p><p> Her lips quivered, and it seemed as if her</p><p>strength were failing, yet she still smiled at </p><p>him. </p><p> “You’d better go, Tony. I mustn’t keep</p><p>you.” </p><p> “It’s hard, love—I never knew how hard</p><p>till now.” </p><p> “Hush! Don’t make it worse, dear. I’ll</p><p>be all right while you’re away. Remember </p><p>that, won’t you!” </p><p> “The war won’t last very long, love, I</p><p>know. It can’t.” </p><p> And why should it? They were only go-</p><p>ing to fight Germany. And what was Ger- </p><p>many? The greatest military power on </p><p>earth—nothing more. And were they to </p><p>be frightened because of that? WTiat were </p><p>mere numbers? Did he not belong to the </p><p>Royal South Irish Fusiliers, the finest regi- </p><p>ment in the whole world, bar none? W7as</p><p>not that sufficient in itself? So: </p><p> “It will be all over by the new year,” said</p><p>Tony. “You see if it isn’t.” </p><p> She flashed a little smile at him through</p><p>her tears, for she was crying now, and tried </p><p>to laugh. </p><p> “Of course. Sooner, I hope.”</p><p> “Good-by, sweetheart. Good-by.”</p><p> She kissed him on the lips, twice, then</p><p>gave him a litde shove. </p><p> “Go, dear. Please.”</p><p> He turned and hurried after the regiment,</p><p>a tightness in his throat and a mist beforc- </p><p>his eyes. </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>THE OPDEAL OF FIFE </p><p>9	rO THOSE ignorant of war, and they</p><p>A be many, a regiment’s history and </p><p>traditions may seem of small importance. </p><p>But a regiment that bears on its colors the </p><p>names of famous victories, and can trace </p><p>its ancestry back tp the days of Wellington </p><p>or Marlborough or Clive or Wolfe, has a </p><p>faith in its own prowess that counts for </p><p>much when there is an enemy to be faced </p><p>ami beaten. </p><p> The very thought of failure was to the</p><p>men of the South Irish, nut merely remote, </p><p>but impossible. Would they, men who had </p><p>joined the army of their own free will, men </p><p>who had served in the four quarters of the </p><p>globe, go down before those who were con- </p><p>scripts, forced to serve? Not though they </p><p>were outnumbered, ten to one </p><p> What German regiment was tit to breathe</p><p>the same air as the South Irish? The rank </p><p>and file had faith not only in themselves, </p><p>but in their officers. If there were fighting </p><p>to be done, the Royal South Irish Fusiliers </p><p>would show the way to any battalion of any </p><p>regiment, Scots, Irish, Welch or English, in </p><p>the army. The Guards themselves could do </p><p>no more. Even the recruits, fresh from </p><p>their training at the depot in the South of </p><p>Ireland, non-commissioned officers, or newly </p><p>joined reservists, not yet free of the taint </p><p>of civil life, who talked of war as men who </p><p>knew its meaning, could feel that they were </p><p>fighters no less than those others, old soldiers </p><p>of twenty years of service. </p><p> So Tony Mallagh watching his men. "hear-</p><p>ing their talk and laughter and songs, could </p><p>rejoice and feel certain in his heart that </p><p>wheresoever it might be his duty to lead, </p><p>there they would follow. For were they not </p><p>of the same blood as the men of Inkerman. </p><p>and Delhi, and Barossa and Waterloo? The </p><p>campaign might go against them—generals</p><p>and staff officers might blunder, plans might </p><p>miscarry, the artillery be outranged—but </p><p>whatever happened, though the machine it- </p><p>self might break down through overwork, </p><p>the blame could never rest with the men </p><p>—or not with the men of the South Irish. </p><p>Not even the thought of Sybil waiting at </p><p>home for news, entirely took from him the </p><p>pride he had in his regiment. </p><p> Whatever the future might have in store,</p><p>the present with its steady tramping of </p><p>many feet, the passing of horse and guns in </p><p>clouds of thick dust, the little towns in the </p><p>hot sunlight, the bivouac under the stars, </p><p>the meeting at cross-roads of other regi- </p><p>ments, the bustle and movement and change </p><p>of scene, was all that mattered. </p><p> And then one afternoon there was borne</p><p>on the breeze a faint far-off rumbling. </p><p> “What’s that?” said a voung private.</p><p>“Thundher?” </p><p> “Ihundher?” Telford, the company Ser-</p><p>geant-Major, grimly humorous, chuckled. </p><p>“That’s no thundher. ’Tis a lulbby that </p><p>ye re hearin’. Did ve niver leshen to guns </p><p>before?” </p><p> “Guns!”</p><p>Lieutenant Tony Mallagh </p><p>13 </p><p> “Sure, an’ it’s guns. ’Tis fiel’ arthillery</p><p>in acthion an’ they’re fightin* yonda al- </p><p>ready.”	1</p><p> Shannon who had overheard the conver-</p><p>sation laughed. </p><p> “Remember the morning we heard the</p><p>guns at Colenso, Sergeant-Major?” </p><p> “Colenso I Shall I iver forgit, sorr? An’</p><p>what happened afther!” </p><p>NEXT morning the South Irish Fu- </p><p>silicrs were under lire. By noon </p><p>they were blooded, two men being </p><p>killed by shrapnel. </p><p> The success or failure of a regiment in</p><p>battle depends on its officers no less than </p><p>on the rank and file. This is beyond argu- </p><p>ment. And although skill in the art of war </p><p>—a knowledge of tactics, strategy, topogra- </p><p>phy', military history and higher mathemat- </p><p>ics—are no doubt highly useful, the private </p><p>soldier, and more especially the Irish pri- </p><p>vate, demands in his officer not only skill, </p><p>but also courage—the courage that stops </p><p>short of nothing, not even death. </p><p> In Shannon, the men of the South Irish</p><p>found one after their own hearts—their ideal </p><p>tighter. In the agony and despair of the </p><p>long retreat from Mons to the Marne, when </p><p>day after day they were driven along with-</p><p>out mercy, footsore and sleepy and famish- </p><p>ed, turning at times and fighting fierce rear- </p><p>guard actions to save both themselves and </p><p>others. Shannon never for a moment lost </p><p>their confidence. Even when things were at </p><p>their worst—when the German guns raked </p><p>the trenches, when men were dying like flies </p><p>in Autumn, when the mere horror and help- </p><p>lessness of modern war sapped the courage </p><p>and weakened the resolution of the strong- </p><p>est—Shannon was at his best. </p><p> And when the limit had been reached be-</p><p>yond which human endurance can not go— </p><p>when even the finest soldiers on earth, out- </p><p>numbered, must break—his voice and pres- </p><p>ence, scornfully tolerant of their weakness, </p><p>brought back to the men around him their </p><p>self-respect. He asked no man to go where </p><p>he himself would not venture. His life he </p><p>seemed to regard as of no importance. He </p><p>was without fear. Even casualties that re- </p><p>duced the regiment to less than two-thirds </p><p>its strength left him unmoved. This was </p><p>the attitude he purposely adopted. Noth- </p><p>ing could be gained, so he argued rightly, in </p><p>letting his men see that he too felt the shock </p><p>and horror of death in its most awful form. </p><p> Tony Mallagh watched him with despair.</p><p>For in spite of the tales that he had heard </p><p>of past campaigns, Tony had never in his </p><p>heart believed it possible that any man </p><p>could bear himself in action as did Shannon. </p><p>Yet what Shannon could do, he, Tony Mal- </p><p>lagh, must do also. No matter how fierce </p><p>the fire, an officer of the Royal South Irish </p><p>Fusiliers, the finest regiment in the army, </p><p>must show himself proof against the slight- </p><p>est sign of fear. He must remember always </p><p>that his men trusted in him to lead them, </p><p>and that whatever happened, no matter </p><p>what others in other regiments might say </p><p>or do, no sign of panic or hesitation in the </p><p>face of danger should escape him. This was </p><p>the law of the regiment that must not be </p><p>broken. </p><p> There are some secrets a man will try and</p><p>hide even from himself. When first he had </p><p>heard the distant thudding of the field-guns </p><p>Tony had felt a thrill of fierce excitement. </p><p>Yet as the time drew near when he should </p><p>find himself in action a dull lassitude crept </p><p>over him. His limbs seemed to lose their </p><p>power. His throat was dry and parched. </p><p>This, he knew, was Nothing. Merely over- </p><p>excitement. Nervousness. He had had </p><p>the feeling before, often, before entering the </p><p>ring to box. It was nothing. </p><p> And yet when the regiment came at</p><p>length into the zone of fire, when the shells </p><p>began to burst on every side, and the bul- </p><p>lets whispered overhead, and men dropped, </p><p>then did Tony Mallagh, Lieutenant in the </p><p>Royal South Irish Fusiliers, find himself in </p><p>the grip of a fear more terrible than any- </p><p>thing he could have dreamed. Nor did the </p><p>fear pass, as he had fondly hoped. Rather </p><p>did it grow and grow, fed on the sights and </p><p>sounds of battle. </p><p> But though his whole being craved for</p><p>safety, though had he obeyed his instincts </p><p>he would have turned and fled, he forced </p><p>himself to a semblance of indifference to </p><p>danger. He laughed and jested with his </p><p>men, he talked easily, he steadied his voice </p><p>and controlled his movements through sheer </p><p>force of will. He was afraid of being killed, </p><p>afraid of being wounded, and yet still more </p><p>afraid of being called a coward. This was </p><p>the greater fear. Had he been less a cow- </p><p>ard, so he reasoned bitterly, he would have </p><p>shamed himself forever. </p><p> War was terrible. War was the waiting</p><p>hour upon hour while the enemy’s guns </p><p>searched for the hidden trench. War was </p><p>M </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the listening to the sobs of the dying and </p><p>of the wounded who couJd no I die. War </p><p>was the witnessing of sights more terrible </p><p>than hell itsell could offer. War was the </p><p>remembering in dead of night those left at </p><p>home to wait and mourn. Vet, only a few </p><p>short weeks before—and this was to Tony </p><p>the most bitter thought of all—war had </p><p>seemed no more than the long awaited </p><p>chance to prove his manhood. The first </p><p>day’s fighting in the trendies had told him </p><p>everything he wished to know. He, Tony </p><p>Mallagh, who had looked on courage as </p><p>man’s highest virtue, was a coward. </p><p>EARLY one morning, before it was </p><p>light,ra large force of the enemy at- </p><p>tacked a post held by B Company </p><p>of the South Irish, a shallow trench thrown </p><p>up the night before on the edge of a small </p><p>wood. </p><p> When the sky was no more than a pale</p><p>gray in the east, scattered shots were heard </p><p>from in front. Soon after, the men of the </p><p>outlying picket arrived at a double, drag- </p><p>ging with them one who was wounded. The </p><p>Germans were close at hand. </p><p> Tony, who had been talking with Shan-</p><p>non, caught his breath. So the Germans </p><p>were coming, were they? How many? The </p><p>corporal in charge of the picket did not</p><p>know. “Swarrms of thim!” he said. Tony </p><p>found himself shaking as if cold. </p><p> But cold or not—and he had not felt that</p><p>he was cold—he must stand his ground or </p><p>else people might say he was frightened 1 </p><p>And that would never do. </p><p> Shannon was speaking.</p><p> “They'll be coming along in a minute or</p><p>so, now, and we’ve got to give ’em a bit of </p><p>a dusting.'’ </p><p> Shannon’s voice was filled with a curious</p><p>exultation. Tony turned to him, heavy and </p><p>listless. He was going to fight. He was </p><p>going to be shot at. And perhaps he was </p><p>going to die. </p><p> Nevertheless, true to his training, he</p><p>forced a laugh. </p><p> “Rather!” he said. “We’re in for a jolly</p><p>scrip, I hope. Like their infernal impu- </p><p>dence trying to rush us, isn’t it?’’ </p><p> He moved off to that portion of the trench</p><p>held by his platoon. </p><p> His platoon sergeant stretched out his</p><p>arm and pointed. </p><p> “Luk, sott! Do ye sec thim?”</p><p> And in the dimness Tony made out ad-</p><p>vancing toward the trench a gray mass, </p><p>huge and indistinct and vague. </p><p> He gulped unsteadily. Were the Ger-</p><p>mans so near as that then? Ought he not </p><p>to be doing something? Did Shannon </p><p>know? </p><p> And then, as in a dream, he heard in suc-</p><p>cession his own voice giving the word of </p><p>command, “Number five platoon—at the </p><p>enemy in front—rapid fire!” the answering </p><p>volleys from the rifles of his men, and a wild </p><p>cheering, unlike the deep cheers of British </p><p>troops, from the foe. Like the oncoming of </p><p>a wall, the Germans advanced. Tony, fight- </p><p>ing back the fears that had gripped him, </p><p>shivered. </p><p> “Let them have it, South Irish!” he said.</p><p>“Let them have it!” </p><p> His men were strangely restive. Their</p><p>firing was ragged. Three or four were not </p><p>even firing at all. </p><p> “What’s the matter, there?” said Tony.</p><p>“You, Reilly, you’re not wounded, are </p><p>you?” </p><p> At another time these same men would</p><p>have resisted to the death. But now, either </p><p>one night’s waiting, or the mystery and </p><p>chill of the dawn, or the suddenness of the </p><p>attack, had sapped their resolution, for </p><p>without waiting, without warning, as if the </p><p>movement were prearranged or ordered, </p><p>they clambered out of their trench and ran.</p><p> Tony, knowing that if they left him his</p><p>only hope of hiding his fears was gone, </p><p>made a half-hearted, despairing effort to </p><p>stop their flight. </p><p> “-you!” he cried, and his voice was</p><p>lost in the crash of musketry from the right </p><p>and in front. “-you, you fools! Get </p><p>back! What the blazes do vou think you’re </p><p>doing?” </p><p> “Go on, bhoys!” shouted a man.</p><p>“They’re on top of us, the divils!” </p><p> Tony staggered against a tree, overborne</p><p>by the rush. The bullets from the Germans, </p><p>who advanced firing from the hip, were </p><p>swishing through the branches. A man </p><p>stumbled and dropped his ritle, then went </p><p>on slowly, limping. Another shrieked in </p><p>mortal agony and fell. </p><p> And that settled it, so far as Tony Mal-</p><p>lagh was concerned. He turned and ran, </p><p>without a thought save for his own safety. </p><p>Was he to be left to face the Germans sin- </p><p>gle-handed? Was he to be killed, for the </p><p>sake ol a mere, outworn tradition? Was </p><p>not his life as valuable to himself as the life </p><p>V </p><p>Lieutenant Tony Mallagh </p><p>15 </p><p>of any private, and was it not much more </p><p>valuable to the regiment? </p><p> He had made his way at a quick, shuf-</p><p>fling run, almost to the other side of the </p><p>small wood when his foot caught in a pro- </p><p>jecting root. He tripped and fell. His </p><p>head crashed against a tree-trunk and he </p><p>knew no more until faintly, as if at a great </p><p>distance, he seemed to hear a voice calling </p><p>his name. </p><p> “Tony, old chap, come on, what is it?"</p><p> Shannon’s voice, surely!</p><p> Tony opened his eyes, to find himself in</p><p>the wood, huddled against a tree, with the </p><p>sun just risen, showing like a red orb </p><p>through the mist, and Shannon on his knees </p><p>beside him. His head throbbed. He felt </p><p>dazed and stupid. He put his hand to his </p><p>forehead and brought it away, covered with </p><p>blood. Two or three privates stood looking </p><p>at him. One was wounded. </p><p> “Hullo! Why—why-”</p><p> “Feeling better?” said Shannon. “We</p><p>haven’t much time to spare, you know.” </p><p> He noticed then that Shannon was star-</p><p>ing at him in a curious way, almost as if he </p><p>were angry or disappointed or puzzled. He </p><p>tried to think. Shannon helped him to his </p><p>feet. </p><p> “We’ve got to be moving, and pretty</p><p>quick,” he said. “They’ll be coming on </p><p>again in a minute or two.” </p><p> Taking him by the arm, he hurried him</p><p>off. </p><p> “Who’ll be coming on?” asked Tony.</p><p> And then a dull feeling of horror crept</p><p>over him. He had turned his back on the </p><p>enemy. The others had beaten them off; </p><p>he had run. Did Shannon know? Had he </p><p>seen him make off? Surely not. It had </p><p>been too dark. And then .... </p><p> “Not going too fast, am I?” said Shan-</p><p>non suddenly. </p><p> “No,” said Tony. “My head aches, but</p><p>I'm better. Much better. And, what— </p><p>what happened?” </p><p> “You ought to know, Tony. What were</p><p>you doing, eh?” There was a note of doubt </p><p>in Shannon’s voice. </p><p> “My fellows bolted. God only knows</p><p>why!” </p><p> “Some of them did. Not all. But what</p><p>about you, man? What were you doing? </p><p>Where were you going?” </p><p> “Me! I went after them—to rally them,</p><p>lo	try and get them back. And as I was</p><p>doing my best to turn them, I caught ray </p><p>foot and fell. That’s all I remember.” He </p><p>ended abruptly. </p><p> “Oh!” said Shannon. “I understand. I</p><p>wondered.” </p><p> “Looked queer, perhaps,” said Tony with</p><p>a nervous laugh. </p><p> “Oh, nonsense! Might have happened to</p><p>any one.” </p><p> And Tony felt that a burden had been</p><p>lifted from off his mind. Shannon under- </p><p>stood. Shannon knew now that he had been </p><p>rallying his men. His secret was safe. But </p><p>there remained in his consciousness the </p><p>dread that when next the hour of trial came, </p><p>when he should be tested once more, he </p><p>should fail again. For whatever might be </p><p>believed of him, the truth remained. He, </p><p>an officer in the Royal South Irish Fusiliers, </p><p>had run in action. </p><p> They joined the rest of the battalion.</p><p>“Hullo, Tony, what’s wTong? Not </p><p>wounded, are you?” One of the other sub- </p><p>alterns spoke to him. </p><p> “Not exactly,” said Tony. “Fell and cut</p><p>my head open.” </p><p> “Hard luck! Some of your people ar-</p><p>rived back here some time ago- looking like </p><p>lost sheep.” </p><p> “I know. I tried to stop them.”</p><p>“Shouldn’t worn.', old thing. They’ll not </p><p>do it again.”</p><p> “Hope not, anyway,” said Tony.</p><p>Shannon was troubled. Even in the fight- </p><p>ing that followed, for the Germans attacked </p><p>once more, and in the retirement early in </p><p>the afternoon, at the back of his mind, ob- </p><p>truding itself when least expected, was a </p><p>strange wonderment. </p><p> Tony had run, of course. That was ob-</p><p>vious. But why? And to hide the truth </p><p>be had lied. Had he tried to rally his men </p><p>he would not have followed them so far. </p><p>What fear was it that had driven him to do </p><p>what no man should do and call himself a </p><p>man? Had he been seized with sudden </p><p>panic? Or could it be that Tony Mallagh, </p><p>as good a man as ever walked—Tony, the </p><p>boxer, the best rider in Uie battalion, Tonv. </p><p>the man who had fought the greengrocer at </p><p>Portsmouth, was a coward! To Shannon it </p><p>seemed impossible. And yet it was true </p><p>Ton)' had turned his back on the enemy </p><p>and run. Why? </p><p> And then there was Sybil. Sybil waiting</p><p>at home for newrs! And Shannon, remem- </p><p>bering that last evening in the little draw- </p><p>ing-room and how proudly she had talked </p><p>16 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>of Tonv, felt a sudden wild anger. Tony, </p><p>her husband, had proved himself unworthy. </p><p> After this Shannon noticed many things</p><p>about Tony Mallagh that were puzzliug. </p><p>He studied him tinder lire, on the march </p><p>and in billets. By the time that the re- </p><p>treat had ended lie had changed greatly. </p><p>He looked years older, tired, dispirited. He </p><p>was cool enough in action, that was evident, </p><p>almost too cool. At a glance it seemed as </p><p>if he held himself in check. He was cheer- </p><p>ful, after a fashion; he still talked in the </p><p>same amusing, self-assertive manner; he </p><p>bore, without murmuring or showing him- </p><p>self impatient, every hardship and discom- </p><p>fort; he showed no sign of weariness nor </p><p>doubt of victory'; he was firm with his men, </p><p>yet always kind and considerate. </p><p> Nevertheless there remained to Shannon</p><p>the memory of the morning when Tony had </p><p>chosen dishonor rather than face death. </p><p>Men did run in action, of course. Some- </p><p>times even the best were liable to panic. </p><p>But that Tony Mallagh should have proved </p><p>himself a cow'ard was to Shannon almost </p><p>as if he himself had been detected in some </p><p>wrong. </p><p> True to his promise, he wrote to Sybil at</p><p>the first opportunity, a few- lines scribbled </p><p>in pencil—</p><p> Tony is splendid; you have no idea. He is happy</p><p>and contented, always. I have heard no word of </p><p>complaint from him at any time. And he is as </p><p>brave in battle as any man could be. The men wor- </p><p>ship him. Honestly, you would think to see him </p><p>that he had been fighting all his life. He took to it </p><p>naturally, like a duck takes to water. I he best sub- </p><p>altern in the battalion, that's what they call him. </p><p>We are all very proud of him. He fights as if he </p><p>were playing football or boxing. Jf you should im- </p><p>agine from anything he writes to you that he has </p><p>reason to be disappointed or worried, perhaps, do </p><p>not pay any attention. It is not true. Wc all of us </p><p>think he has done splendidly, from the Colonel </p><p>downward. </p><p> And the part about the Colonel was, as</p><p>he discovered soon after writing, quite true. </p><p>For the Colonel thought well of Tony. </p><p> “I’m not saying a word against the rest</p><p>of ’em,” he said, “but Tony Mallagh’s the </p><p>best—far and away the best. 1 m very sat- </p><p>isfied, indeed.” </p><p> “Yes, sir,” Shannon nodded. “We’ve as</p><p>good a crowd of subalterns in the South </p><p>Irish as you’d want.” </p><p> “And he's not foolish like young O’Con-</p><p>nell, for instance. O’Connell er—seems all </p><p>the time bent on—well, on showing off. </p><p>Tony Mallagh’s sound. Looks after his </p><p>men, keeps ’em in hand, won’t let ’em kill </p><p>themselves off just for effect. And you </p><p>know yourself, Shannon, what that means </p><p>with a crowd like we've got. No, I’m very </p><p>pleased with young Mallagh, very pleased, </p><p>indeed. He’s steadied down immensely of </p><p>late—since he’s been married, in fact. Good </p><p>wife he’s got, too. Very good! Yes, I'm </p><p>pleased with him. He’ll go far.1’ </p><p> And, as Shannon discovered, the men</p><p>were of a like opinion. </p><p>THE regiment had halted for a brief </p><p>rest one night and the men were </p><p>bivouacked in a large field. The ri- </p><p>fles were stacked; the smoke of the fires </p><p>drifted upward; the sky was a dull orange </p><p>in the west. Men were scattered about on </p><p>the grass, smoking or sleeping, worn out. by </p><p>the day’s toil, waiting for their evening meal. </p><p> Shannon coming in from the pickets stop-</p><p>ped to speak to the company Sergeant-Ma- </p><p>jor. He had said all he had wanted to, and </p><p>was about to move off, when the voices of </p><p>a group of men seated only a few yards dis- </p><p>tant drew his attention. </p><p> “Did ye see him today whin owld Mc-</p><p>Ginnis was like to dhrop with fatigue, an’ </p><p>his feet worn to ribbons by the dint of the </p><p>marchin’ we’re afther havin’? A good lad</p><p>is Misther Mallagh, an’ no mistake." </p><p> “He’s unbelaivably sthrick.”</p><p> “An’ with raison. For what wud the</p><p>reg’mint be like if he warn’t, with malin- </p><p>gerers an’ skrimshankers in it like you, Tim </p><p>Rafferty?” </p><p> There was a laugh at this and another</p><p>began to speak. </p><p> "There’s wan fault in him, an’ to my wav</p><p>of thinkin’ the greathest fault that a sol- </p><p>dhier can have. He’s a good little man, I’m </p><p>not denyin’ the same, but he ought to be </p><p>betther. He takes his tightin’ too aisy, </p><p>without judgmint. If he cud but remimber </p><p>now that we are not at anny fiel’-day, but </p><p>that the inemy are thryin' their besht fer </p><p>to kill us, he’d be as good a man as ye’d </p><p>w'ant. There’s somethin' he lacks. He’s </p><p>no inmity agin’ the Gerrmans. But, on the </p><p>day that he first gits angry, ye'll see great </p><p>tilings. There’ll be no howldin’ him." </p><p>Shannon was startled. </p><p> “ I hat’s funny," he said. “Did you h« ar,</p><p>Telford, what the men were saying just </p><p>then?” </p><p> “About Misther Mallagh, sorr? I heard</p><p>that, sorr. I dunno’ but what they’re right, </p><p>Lieutenant Tony Mallagh </p><p>17 </p><p>too. Thrust the men to pick out the wake </p><p>point in an orf’ccr, whin it comes to a mat- </p><p>ther of tfghtin’. An’ Misther Mallagh, </p><p>sorr, for all that he’s as good a young orf’cer </p><p>as ye’d want over ye, has not yit been </p><p>worrked up to the pitch where he fights as </p><p>if ivry wan of the Gerrmans was a privut, </p><p>personal inemy. He’s too cowld an’ col- </p><p>lected. Wait till he gits angry.” </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>THE WOMAN AT THE FARM </p><p>LATE in the afternoon Tony Mallagh </p><p>and some dozen or so men strung out </p><p>in open order, made their way down a steep </p><p>wooded hill-slope toward a small farm, </p><p>tucked away in the narrow valley. The day </p><p>was very hot and still, the sky a deep blue, </p><p>flecked with white clouds. Guns thundered </p><p>incessantly in the distance. </p><p> At the edge of the wood, where the trees</p><p>grew thin, Tony halted and let his eyes </p><p>wander from right to left, suspicious of </p><p>danger. Across a field of bleached stubble </p><p>lay the farmhouse, small and white, with a </p><p>red-tiled roof, overgrown with moss and </p><p>ivy, and showing no sign of life save the </p><p>thin trickle of smoke from the chimney. </p><p>Beyond was a large barn and outbuildings, </p><p>a well and an apple-orchard. Further off</p><p>again were more trees and the ridge that </p><p>made up the opposite slope of the valley. </p><p>“Purty as a pictliure,” said one of the </p><p>men. “Sure, it puts me in mind of Kerry.” </p><p>“Don’t see any one around, do you, </p><p>Sergeant-Major?” said Tony. “But we’d </p><p>better be careful.” </p><p> “There’ll be no Germans lift this way,</p><p>sorr, if that’s what ye mane.” </p><p> “There’s a cow yonda, sorr. By the</p><p>threes.” </p><p> “I think,” said Tony deliberately, “that</p><p>we’ll investigate. Corporal Birkett, you, </p><p>and Kelly, you, just work ’round to the left, </p><p>will you. O’Connor and Madden bear </p><p>away to the right.” He paused. “And I </p><p>think the rest of us can risk walking right </p><p>up to the front door.” </p><p> “Mebbe there'll be such a thing as a</p><p>dhrink o’ milk to be had for the axin’,” </p><p>said a private cheerfully. “Or beer.” </p><p> As they drew near the house, a woman</p><p>came to the door and stood looking toward </p><p>them with a hand shielding her eyes from </p><p>the glare of the sun. </p><p>2 </p><p> “I wondher now can she sphake English?”</p><p> said the Sergeant-Major doubtfully.</p><p> “Niver yit do I remimber meetin’ anny</p><p> wan what cudn’t, save an' ixciptin’ that</p><p> Gerrman orf’cer what we caught in the</p><p> dhrain two mornin’s back—him that swore</p><p> so fluent in his own tongue whin Tim Dolan</p><p> dhropped his rifle on top of him."</p><p> Tony opened the little wooden gate and</p><p> walked up the path between masses of flow-</p><p> ers. When he was within a few paces of the</p><p> woman he halted and saluted. She looked</p><p> at him with a grave face and then as if re-</p><p> assured gave a little nervous bow. A small</p><p> girl ran out and clung shyly to her skirts.</p><p> From the back of the house there arose the</p><p> frantic barking of a dog and the voice of</p><p> Private O’Connor uttering soothing sounds.</p><p> Racking his memory for the right words,</p><p> Tony began to speak in French, slowly and</p><p> badly. The woman laughed.</p><p> “N’imporU,” she said. "Jc park An-</p><p> glais—a little. Is it not so? And, monsieur</p><p> is English?”</p><p> Tony nodded, surprised.</p><p> From behind his back came a low whis-</p><p> per.</p><p> “She’s makin’ a big mistake. It’s Irish</p><p> we are. South Irish. Corrk, Tipperary’.</p><p> The place it’s a long way to.”</p><p> “Have you had any Germans here?”</p><p> asked Tony.</p><p> She shook her head. They had seen no</p><p> soldiers at all. Not one. No Germans had</p><p> come into the valley. Not yet at least. Nor</p><p> would they. Not now. She made a little</p><p> gesture of contempt with her hands. They</p><p> were going. Like frost before the sun. She</p><p> had no fear of Germans. Why should she</p><p> have? She was only a woman, doing the</p><p> work that the good God had pven her.</p><p> Who would harm her? Not even the Ger-</p><p> mans.</p><p> “But,” said Ton&gt;% “are you here all by</p><p> yourself? Aren’t there any men—belonging</p><p> to the place? Haven't you a husband?”</p><p>To Tony it seemed impossible that a </p><p>. woman should be living with her children </p><p>alone in the midst of a battle. Surely she </p><p>must have some man who could help, if </p><p>help were needed! </p><p> Her husband! The woman laughed</p><p> proudly. Where would he be at such a</p><p> time? He was fighting—pour Ij painc.</p><p> She hoped, she said, that he was killing</p><p> Germans. He had left her when war broke</p><p> out. She might not see him again till the</p><p>is </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Boches were driven back across the Rhine. </p><p>If he shuuld die— She gave a shrug of her </p><p>shoulders. “Monsieur, soyez certain qiie </p><p>qu'il mourra bicn." </p><p> There was no man nearer the farm, she</p><p>added, than those in the little town across </p><p>the hill, only her father. But would the </p><p>officer care to step inside and see for him- </p><p>self? He saw strangers seldom, her father. </p><p>It would cheer him up. Also, there was milk </p><p>to be had, and some cider, and perhaps an </p><p>egg or so. </p><p> Tony glanced at the little group of dirty,</p><p>unshaven Irishmen in their war-Worn khaki. </p><p> “Telford,” he said to the Sergeant-</p><p>Major, “come along in, and see what her </p><p>father's like. Queer, eh?” </p><p> They entered the house. In the little</p><p>kitchen which was very clean and neat, with </p><p>a stone floor and low ceiling and a row of red </p><p>geraniums in llower-pots on the long </p><p>window-sill, there sat a withered little old </p><p>man, with bowed shoulders and wrinkled </p><p>face and bright eyes. He smiled at Tony, </p><p>but made no attempt to rise from the big </p><p>chair in which he was seated in front of the </p><p>stove. </p><p> “Bon jour, vi'sicu'," said Tony.</p><p> The little old man, who was dressed in</p><p>black and about whose legs was a shawl of </p><p>some reddish plaid stuff, nodded and smiled</p><p>and said a few words in a high, thin voice </p><p>so quickly that Tony could not grasp their </p><p>meaning. He turned to the woman. </p><p> “He helps you in the work, eh?”</p><p> She shook her head, as if such a thing</p><p>were unheard of. </p><p> “Once. Not now. See, monsieur.” And</p><p>then Tonv, seeing the crutches leaning </p><p>against the wall, understood. </p><p> ‘Toor old chap, I’m sorry.”</p><p> The woman’s face clouded suddenly. It</p><p>was sad. He was helpless, able to walk </p><p>only with such pain and labor. Helpless. </p><p>Since five years now he had done nothing. </p><p>He was not old, but he had aged greatly. </p><p>His grief when war came—ah. but it was </p><p>terrible! In 1870 he had been too young to </p><p>fight; now he was unable. She spoke to the </p><p>little mar. and he smiled at her and nodded </p><p>his head. </p><p> “Aren’t y&lt;*u afraid to stay here, so near</p><p>the lighting?” asked Tony. </p><p> “And if 1 left, monsieur, who would look</p><p>after the farm? The men go to the war for </p><p>their country’s safety, and honor. May not </p><p>a woman work? Where would the harvest </p><p>have been but for me? And I am strong, </p><p>monsieur, as strung almost as my man him- </p><p>self who is a soldier.” She laughed. “And </p><p>if I left, munsieur, where would I go? </p><p>Also—” she nodded toward the opposite </p><p>corner of the room where in a cradle between </p><p>the window and a tall oak dresser lay a buby </p><p>soundly sleeping—“one has responsibilities, </p><p>is it not? And where should I go? To </p><p>Paris! No, monsieur. If my man returns </p><p>and tinds me gone, what would he think? </p><p>Does a soldier desert his regiment, or his </p><p>flag? No more does a woman desert her </p><p>home. I have my duty, even as mv hus- </p><p>band. If I stay here no one will do me harm. </p><p>A woman with two little ones is safe.” </p><p> Tony watched her while she spoke. Hard</p><p>work, and she must have worked hard .since </p><p>her husband left, had not stolen away her </p><p>looks. She was well built, not tall, but </p><p>straight and strong and slender. Her skin </p><p>was a warm dusky bronze, with a rich red </p><p>in her cheeks; her hair was a golden l»r .. n; </p><p>her eyes were blue. Once she must have </p><p>been pretty he was certain. She war that </p><p>now, indeed, if she were nicely dressed. </p><p> The woman was filling a jug from a cask</p><p>that stood by the dresser, still chattering </p><p>away in her queer, clipped English, as if </p><p>glad to have the chance to air her knowl- </p><p>edge. </p><p> The cider was good, she said, of her own</p><p>making. Her husband had said that her </p><p>cider was better than any. And he was a </p><p>judge. She straightened her back and </p><p>laughed happily. </p><p> And then like the flashing of a search-</p><p>light in the darkness it came over Tony that </p><p>there was something about her, an indefina- </p><p>ble something, that put him in mind of </p><p>Sybil. His lips twisted into a little smile of </p><p>amusement at the fancy. Like Sybil! But. </p><p>of course, that was ridiculous! Was he to </p><p>compare a French farmer’s wife with Sybil? </p><p>As well might he compare Telford, strong </p><p>and active and healthy, with the little crip- </p><p>ple in the arm-chair. </p><p> But was the fancy, as he had termed it,</p><p>so foolish? She did not resemble Sybil in </p><p>the very least and yet there was a likeness. </p><p>Her eyes were the same blue, her hair was </p><p>the same golden-brown. Even her laugh </p><p>had the same joyous freshness as had </p><p>Sybil’s. And when asked a question of </p><p>which she was not quite sure, she had the </p><p>same trick of raising her eyebrows before </p><p>answering. </p><p>Lieutenant Tony Mallagh </p><p>19 </p><p> Moreover, there was the certainty that</p><p>as this girl had spoken of her husband </p><p>lighting for his country, so also would Sybil </p><p>speak of him. </p><p> The French woman approached, a glass</p><p>of cider in each hand. </p><p> “But, perhaps, monsieur would prefer</p><p>some wine?” </p><p> Tony shook his head. The cider would do</p><p>splendidly. </p><p> “And you’re not afraid to be here by</p><p>yourself?” he asked. “It’s very brave of </p><p>you, but I think somehow it’s running a </p><p>great risk. You’re so very near the fight- </p><p>ing. And we don’t know which way it may </p><p>go” </p><p> She shrugged her shoulders. The good</p><p>God would preserve her. She knew it. </p><p>No harm would come if she stayed at home </p><p>and did the work of the farm. </p><p> Tony set down his empty glass.</p><p> “Very good, indeed,” he said. “Tres</p><p>bon.” </p><p> The woman held out the jug. Would</p><p>monsieur care for some more then? He </p><p>shook h?s head and smiled. No, he had had </p><p>sufficieni. They ought to be moving on. </p><p>If she had a glass or so to spare for the men, </p><p>though, he would be grateful. She nodded </p><p>and led the way out of the little kitchen into </p><p>the sunshine where the soldiers were waiting.</p><p> While they drank she watched them with</p><p>an air of pride and good-nature, and when </p><p>Tony offered to pay, refused firmly. No, </p><p>they were fighting for France, for her, for </p><p>her children. Money, no! It was a pleas- </p><p>ure. </p><p> Tony beckoned to the little girl and when</p><p>she came to him, smiling shyly, put a gold </p><p>coin into her tiny palm. </p><p> “Merci, m’sieu’,” she said, and running</p><p>to her mother hid her rosy cheeks in her </p><p>skirts. </p><p> “Where did you learn English?” asked</p><p>Tony suddenly. “You speak very well in- </p><p>deed. Have you been in England?” </p><p> She laughed and shook her head. In</p><p>England! No, never. What little English </p><p>she knew, she had learned from an English </p><p>lady and gentleman for whom she had </p><p>cooked in Paris. A fine couple, generous to </p><p>a degree, but so simple! They had stayed </p><p>a Winter and Spring in Paris to learn </p><p>French. They had learned no more than a </p><p>few words, that went without saying, but </p><p>—again she shrugged her shoulders—but </p><p>she herself, she had had to learn English. </p><p>And she laughed once more, as if it had been </p><p>the greatest joke in the world, and as if </p><p>the men before her were her own friends </p><p>and countrymen, and not soldiers of another </p><p>nation on active service, warning her that </p><p>the fighting was near and might come </p><p>nearer. </p><p> “Well,” said Tony, “we must go now.</p><p>Maybe we’ll see you again. Au revoir, </p><p>madame, and good luck.” </p><p> They went away, past the bam and sheds</p><p>and the orchard at the back of the house to </p><p>the wooded slope on the opposite side of </p><p>the valley. </p><p> When they reached the foot of the hill,</p><p>Tony turned and looked back. The little </p><p>farm with its meadows and orchard was like </p><p>some quiet haven far from the world's </p><p>trouble and turmoil. For the first time since </p><p>the morning when he had left home, there </p><p>had stolen into Tony Mallagh’s conscious- </p><p>ness a sense of restfulness and peace. There </p><p>was no war. Men no longer killed and </p><p>wounded each other to show their love for </p><p>their countries. The booming of the big </p><p>guns that never ended became as the mur- </p><p>muring of waves on the shore. In the valley </p><p>one might live and be happy. Even he, </p><p>Tony Mallagh, of the South Irish. </p><p> And as he gazed he saw the woman</p><p>standing at the back of the house. He </p><p>waved his hand in farewell, and with a little</p><p>sigh followed his men. </p><p> “Funny, isn’t it,” he said to the company</p><p>Sergeant-Major, “that a woman should </p><p>stop here all alone with fighting so near! </p><p>Plucky of her, of course.” </p><p> “It is so,” said Telford. “But I’m</p><p>think in' she’s as safe where she is as she’d </p><p>be if she moved We’ve no manes of know- </p><p>in’ how matthers are goin' yit, but from </p><p>what we have seen this past few days, an’ </p><p>the way we're afther pushin’ ahead, it luks </p><p>like the Germans can do nothin' but go </p><p>back, where they come from."' </p><p> For a time Tony said nothing. When he</p><p>spoke again they were nearing the crest of </p><p>the ridge. </p><p> “It’s rough on her having to be by her-</p><p>self, isn’t it? And she! so everlastingly </p><p>cheerful. That’s what beats me. You </p><p>wouldn’t think her husband was away </p><p>fighting, would you? He may be dead by </p><p>this time for all she knows, too.’’ </p><p> And once more he thought of Sybil, at</p><p>home, wondering if he were still alive, hop- </p><p>ing and trusting, yet never knowing what </p><p>20 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>minute might bring the news that would </p><p>take from her life all hope of happiness. </p><p> "It’s harrd on the women, is war,” said</p><p>Telford. “You an' me, sorr, we're men, an’ </p><p>what do we know what fears that poor sowl </p><p>down in the valley yonda is sufferin’? An’ </p><p>what's more, we’ll niver see her again to </p><p>find out what’s become of her.” </p><p> In this the Sergeant-Major was wrong.</p><p>THAT night Tony found a letter </p><p>from Sybil awaiting him, the first </p><p>he had had at the front. </p><p>Dearest: </p><p> I am wondering where you will be when you get</p><p>this, or if indeed you will get it at all. I have heard </p><p>from you four times already, and when your hist </p><p>letter was written you had not liad so much as a </p><p>line from me. But, dear, 1 have written more than </p><p>a dozen times. You don’t think, Tony dear, that I </p><p>haven't, do you? I hate to think of your wondering </p><p>why I don’t write, for I did, Tony, really and truly. </p><p>And I sent oil parcels of socks and shirts, for the </p><p>nights will be cold out of doors. And there were also </p><p>some cigarettes and cake and chocolate. I do hope, </p><p>dearest, that something has reached you by now. </p><p> I have no news. And the little I have had I told</p><p>you in my other letters. If you have had them you </p><p>will know. But it’s nothing more than each day the </p><p>same as the day before. I am very happy with Mrs. </p><p>Came. She is a perfect dear. We do a good deal of </p><p>sewing and knitting, socks and things, for the troops.</p><p>And we read the papers, all of them, and are so </p><p>proud to hear that the South Irish have done so </p><p>well. We heard there was a wounded soldier at the </p><p>London Hospital who belonged to the South Irish, </p><p>so we went to see him. He was a man called </p><p>O'Sullivan, in Mr. Packman’s platoon, and so inter- </p><p>esting. He had seen you in the retreat after Mons, </p><p>and he said that you were so brave and cheerful, </p><p>and kind. Oh, my dear, my dearl I nearly cried </p><p>when he told us. You are having such hardships </p><p>out at the front, and here am I at home, safe and </p><p>living in comfort while you are lighting. It seems </p><p>unfair. </p><p> Tony, I never realized how much you were—are</p><p>to me while I had you at home. Now, I know. </p><p>You're everything, my dear, everything. And </p><p>sometimes I wake up at night with a start and </p><p>imagine I can hear the guns in the distance and I </p><p>wonder whether you arc lying out in the open, and </p><p>if it is raining and cold, and where you are. My </p><p>dear, you are never out of my thoughts. I pray </p><p>for you night and morning, and sweetheart—don't </p><p>laugh dear—whenever I've nothing particular to </p><p>do, whenever I find myself with a minute or two lo </p><p>spare—and that's very often, alas!—I say little </p><p>prayers to God that He will bring you back'to me. </p><p>I know He will. I feel certain. And I know, love, </p><p>that you will fight bravely and make your men feel </p><p>I was so glad to know that they liked and admired </p><p>you so much. Sullivan, poor chap, has lost both </p><p>his arms. Isn't it awful? I do not know what he </p><p>will do when he gets birttcr. We are hoping that the </p><p>Government pension will be really enough for him </p><p>and his wife lo live on. </p><p> And now, dear, I must end. I do pray that this</p><p>cruel war may soon be over, and that the South </p><p>Irish will help lo win the victory that is coming. </p><p>And l he day can't come too :*&gt;on. Tony mine, when </p><p>I shall see you again. But I am so proud of you, </p><p>Tony dear. And I just hate and despise any man </p><p>that at the present Lime will not see that he is </p><p>wanted, and that it is his duty to train and prepare </p><p>himself to fight for his Country. </p><p> With love, old boy, and heaps of good luck,</p><p>from SvbiL. </p><p> P. S.—Poor Mrs. keane! I was so sorry for her</p><p>when she had news that her husband was taken </p><p>risoner. She was so sad about it. But I comforted </p><p>er by saying that there was one thing good in the </p><p>news, and that was that he was safe at least. If be </p><p>was a prisoner of war he would at least be out of the </p><p>fighting. And that cheered her up quite a lot. We </p><p>hear that his wound is not as bad as it might have </p><p>been. Major Came wrote and told her. But she </p><p>felt that it was such a blow on poor Captain Keane </p><p>to be out of everything from now on. </p><p> Tony read and reread the letter. He</p><p>could almost see Sybil as she wTote it, and he</p><p>felt that though far away in the flesh, in the </p><p>spirit she was very near. Had he ever real- </p><p>ized properly, in the past, in those few short </p><p>dream-weeks when they had been man and </p><p>wife, the depth of feeling in a woman’s </p><p>heart? The letter told him far more fully </p><p>than the mere words could express what </p><p>Sybil thought of him, how much her happi- </p><p>ness depended on his safe return. Suppo- </p><p>sing he were killed! It almost hurt him, like </p><p>some physical pain, to think what life w ould </p><p>be for her, the loneliness, the dreariness. </p><p>If it wfas bad now, what would it be ii he </p><p>were dead? </p><p> He folded the letter and placed it in his</p><p>pocketbook. What was the use of fretting? </p><p>Worry- would only make things the harder </p><p>to bear. Because his country was at war he </p><p>must risk his life. A feeling of sick help- </p><p>lessness came over him. He might be </p><p>killed at any moment of the day or </p><p>night. </p><p> Nothing could save him. Nothing, except</p><p>to turn and run. And would that help? </p><p>Sybil was proud of him. Proud! Oh, God! </p><p>Proud of a man who was a coward at heart, </p><p>who had deserted his post in battle, who </p><p>had to fight his own fears at ever}' turn. </p><p>And at that the helplessness gave way to </p><p>a fierce anger.--war! Why should a </p><p>man, a free man, consent to do what his </p><p>whole being loathed. Why? Because he </p><p>had to. Because there was no escape. He </p><p>laughed. </p><p> “Hullo, young feller, why the mirth?”</p><p> Shannon, big and broad and smiling, had</p><p>entered the little room. Tony felt a sudden </p><p>Lieutenant Tony Mallagh </p><p>21 </p><p>envy. What cares had Shannon? Shan- </p><p>non had no one at home depending on him. </p><p>Shannon went into action free from anxiety. </p><p>What did Shannon know of the sorrow and </p><p>grief of parting? </p><p> "Just heard from Sybil,” he said.</p><p> “Ah!” Shannon’s square, sunburnt face</p><p>became very serious. “Ah! and how is she? </p><p>Fit, I hope.” </p><p> “I think so,” said Tony. “Seems to be.</p><p>She’s a little worried, of course.” </p><p> “Of course!” said Shannon, and he nod-</p><p>ded his head once or twice as if he could </p><p>understand and sympathize, which, thought </p><p>Tony bitterly, was the one thing a man like </p><p>Shannon could not do. </p><p> He understand? He sympathize? Why,</p><p>Shannon had no more feeling about him </p><p>than a graven image! His whole existence</p><p>was bound up in the regiment. Anything </p><p>beyond had no interest. A good chap, that </p><p>much Tony granted, a splendid soldier, </p><p>none better, a brave man, but in some ways </p><p>strangely stupid. </p><p> Shannon seated himself on a high-backed</p><p>chair at the opposite end of the table. The </p><p>room was rather dark, lit only by one dim </p><p>oil	lamp, hanging from the ceiling. Red-hot</p><p>embers glowed in the small grate; occa- </p><p>sionally ashes fell into the hearth. In a cor- </p><p>ner wrapped in a blanket one of the other </p><p>subalterns was sleeping. </p><p> Tony raised his eyes to find Shannon</p><p>gazing at him with a puzzled expression. </p><p> “Aren’t you going to get any sleep to-</p><p>night, Tony?” he asked. “It’s latish, you </p><p>know, and we’re as likely as not to be routed </p><p>up by four.” </p><p> “Dunno’,” said Tony. “I’m not tired.</p><p>As a matter of fact, I’m not sleeping very </p><p>well these nights.” </p><p> “Huh!'’ Shannon grunted. “Why don’t</p><p>you speak of it then, eh? You can’t do much </p><p>if you’re not sleeping, you know.” </p><p> For a minute or so there was silence in the</p><p>little room. Tony rested his chin on his </p><p>knuckles and gazed at the blue of the sky </p><p>that showed through the open window and </p><p>pondered. </p><p> Why had Shannon said that he could do</p><p>no good unless he slept? Did that mean </p><p>that he was in fact doing badly? Were </p><p>people talking of him behind his back? </p><p>Was the secret, that he had guarded with </p><p>such jealous care, common property in the </p><p>regiment? Had Shannon known all along </p><p>that he had run from the Germans in panic? </p><p>Had he known that his excuse of rallying </p><p>his men had been untrue? Perhaps even </p><p>now he pitied him. </p><p> He leaned forward, seized with a sudden</p><p>determination to learn the worst. </p><p> “Would you mind if I asked you a ques-</p><p>tion, sir? It’s rather important.” </p><p> “Ask away, son. Nothing wrong, is</p><p>there?” </p><p> “Well—well—” Tony reddened. It was</p><p>harder than he had expected. “Well, sir, </p><p>it’s this: How do you think I'm doing?” </p><p>“I think you're doing very well,” said </p><p>Shannon deliberately. “Very’ well, indeed. ’ </p><p>Tony considered. The answer was satis- </p><p>factory, as far as it went. Did it go far </p><p>enough? </p><p> “Have you seen anything to make you</p><p>think I don’t care for fighting, sir? Or that </p><p>I’m afraid when we’re in action?”</p><p>“Afraid!” said Shannon. “Nonsense!” </p><p>But to himself he said: “Now, what’s he </p><p>driving at? What is it he’s trying to tell me?-’ </p><p>“Sometimes,” said Tony, “I think I'm </p><p>scared.” </p><p> “Nine-tenths of the men who go under</p><p>fire for the first time are.” </p><p> “Then you wouldn’t call me a coward,’’</p><p>persisted Tony. </p><p> Shannon frowned.</p><p> “What the devil's wrong with you to-</p><p>night, Tony? A coward! No. Don't be </p><p>an idiot! You're as good as any man in the </p><p>regiment. I’ll tell you one thing, though, </p><p>and that is-” </p><p> He shot a quick glance at Tony. “You</p><p>don’t mind my speaking plainly, do you? ' </p><p>“Very glad, sir, if you would,” said Tony, </p><p>and his heart began to beat a trifle faster. </p><p>But now that his doubts were set at re?t, </p><p>Shannon might say whatever he choose. </p><p>Compared with what he had thought, noth- </p><p>ing mattered. </p><p> “I’m not quite sure what it is,” continued</p><p>Shannon, “or whether indeed it’s anything </p><p>at all, but you give the impression, Tony, </p><p>of—well, of not being interested in vour </p><p>work.” </p><p> Tony nodded nervously.</p><p> “I’m interested enough, in a way." He</p><p>stopped short, wondering what in the world </p><p>Shannon meant. Not interested! I don't </p><p>quite understand,” he said. “I shouldn t </p><p>like the war to go on forever, sir, of course.” </p><p>“Nobody would,” said Shannon dryly. </p><p>“It’s the uselessness of the whole thing </p><p>that I hate most,” said Tony. </p><p>") ■&gt; </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Is that the sum total of your impres-</p><p>sions?” asked Shannon. “I'd Like to know </p><p>what you really do think about it.” </p><p> “It s hard to say,” said Tony, and he felt</p><p>rather uncomfortable and ill at ease. “I’m </p><p>a soldier and 1 have to light. That I know. </p><p>But—why should I have to kill Germans? </p><p>I don't hate them. All I can think of in </p><p>action is that the men we’re pumping lead </p><p>into, the men who are try ing to attack us </p><p>and are being wiped out, are men like we </p><p>are; that there are wives in Germany wait- </p><p>ing for news—wives and mothers and </p><p>daughters—just as Sybil at home waits </p><p>for news of me. Poor devils! It makes me </p><p>sick to see the way they go down when they </p><p>attack in those masses of theirs. It’s mur- </p><p>der. Poor wretched conscripts! And being </p><p>driven on by their officers. You’ve seen</p><p>them, eh? Like tattle being driven to the </p><p>slaughter-house. Why?” He ended ab- </p><p>ruptly. </p><p> Shannon was bewildered, out of his</p><p>depth. </p><p> “D’you mean to tell me, Tony Mallagh,</p><p>that you go into action with thoughts like </p><p>those. Good Lord, man, it’s a mystery to </p><p>me you don’t take to your heels and bolt!’’ </p><p>He saw the sudden shame and fear in Tony’s </p><p>face, and hurried on. “Don’t you realize </p><p>that those fathers and husbands and broth- </p><p>ers of yours are doing their darn'dest to kill </p><p>you and me and the rest of us? You kill or </p><p>be killed. There’s no other alternative. </p><p>D" you think they’d have any mercy on </p><p>you just because you’ve a wife at home?” </p><p> “No-o,” said Tony doubtfully. “Of</p><p>course not.” </p><p> There came into Shannon’s mind the</p><p>memory of the conversation he had over- </p><p>heard some nights before. </p><p> “Tony,” he said. “War’s not a game.</p><p>It’s dead earnest. There’s only one way </p><p>to end it quickly and that’s by smashing the </p><p>men we’re fighting. Half measures won’t </p><p>do. You’re too - casual about it. I </p><p>wonder what you’d be like if you got angry. </p><p>If you're thinking how hard it is on the </p><p>Germans to be wiped out by our chaps, </p><p>you'll never do any good. </p><p> “And, Tony, remember this: though</p><p>you're in France you’re fighting to keep the </p><p>Germans out of your own country. And </p><p>you're lighting for Sybil. And if you’ll take </p><p>my advice you’ll get angry and fight as if </p><p>every German was a personal, particular </p><p>enemy of your own who was trying to smash </p><p>up your home and all that you have. If </p><p>you do that, if you once lose your temper, </p><p>and see red, well—remembering the story </p><p>of the greengrocer’s horse and the light at </p><p>Portsmouth, you’ll be hard to beat.” </p><p> Tony sighed a trifle wearily. Shannon</p><p>had meant to be kind, of course. But he </p><p>didn’t understand. How could he? </p><p> As for the advice he had given, it was use-</p><p>less. Had he not enough to do as it was, </p><p>without worrying his head about matters </p><p>of no importance? With heartfelt thankful- </p><p>ness he realized that his secret was safe. </p><p>But for how long? The foe that he fought </p><p>was not the German army', neither horse </p><p>nor foot nor guns, but himself. Would the </p><p>day ever come when he could claim the </p><p>victory? The knowledge of what he really </p><p>was, sickened him. For Sybil’s sake he must </p><p>live; for Sybil's sake he must overcome his</p><p>fear. </p><p> He laughed abruptly’, and then forced a</p><p>yawn. </p><p> “Lord! I’m tired. I think I'll turn in,</p><p>sir. It was awfullyr good of you to ha e tol :l </p><p>me all that. I'll remember.’’ He stood up </p><p>and collected his b elongings. ‘ ‘ Hope there 11 </p><p>be a mail soon again. It's like Heaven </p><p>hearing from home occasionally’. That’s </p><p>the worst of being out here—you’re lost.” </p><p> And the last thing he saw as he dropped</p><p>off to sleep was Shannon seated in the high- </p><p>backed chair, his elbows on the table, his </p><p>head propped by his hands, as one deep in </p><p>thought. </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>THE HARVEST </p><p>IN THE three days that followed, </p><p>though the battle continued with un- </p><p>abated fury’, stretching over a vast frontage, </p><p>the South Irish Fusiliers saw but little of </p><p>the actual fighting, being in reserve. For </p><p>this Tony was devoutly thankful. The rest </p><p>put fresh heart into him. </p><p> And then one morning when the mists</p><p>were fading before the sun, a platoon was </p><p>sent forward to reconnoitre and occupy’ a </p><p>hill. Thus it was that shortly’ before noon </p><p>Tony Mallagh saw from the slope of the </p><p>thickly-wooded ridge the small valley and </p><p>the farm and remembered once more the </p><p>woman who had reminded him of Sybil. </p><p> “I w'onder if there’ve been anyr Germans</p><p>around since we were here last,” he said, and </p><p>a corporal standing near him shook his head. </p><p>Lieutenant Tony Mallagh </p><p>23 </p><p> “By the luk of the house, sorr, ’tis the</p><p>same.” </p><p> “Maybe it is,” said Tony, “but it might</p><p>be worth our while making sure.” </p><p> They pushed their way through thickets</p><p>and tangled undergrowth, under the shade </p><p>of tall oaks, as fair and full of God's glory </p><p>as if the grim carnage of war were but a </p><p>mortal dream, until in a clearing lit by the </p><p>sun, half-way down the hill, they came </p><p>across a man who lay on his back, a High- </p><p>lander, liis blind eyes staring up into the </p><p>blue, his face set in a mocking smile, a line </p><p>of blood marking his last, lonely pilgrimage </p><p>on earth. </p><p> Tony shivered. The men had halted and</p><p>were waiting, uncertain, peering through </p><p>the screen of trees. </p><p> “Now, I wonder,” said Tony half to him-</p><p>self, “I wonder what brought him here. </p><p>Poor devil!”</p><p> “He wasn’t killed here, sorr,” said Tel-</p><p>ford. “It was on the top of the hill he was </p><p>wounded, he came to the valley to die. </p><p>Maybe he was makin’ for the farrm.” </p><p> Tony glanced over his shoulder.</p><p> “Corporal Birkett, I’ll get you, and</p><p>O'Connor, you, to go forward and see if </p><p>there’s any sign of the enemy. There won’t </p><p>be. They couldn’t have got in here, or </p><p>we’d have seen ’em, but we’ll make sure. </p><p>We’ll wait at the edge of the field and have </p><p>you covered in case— Understand!” </p><p> They watched the two men crossing the</p><p>yellow stubble. Everything was very still. </p><p>The farm seemed even more desolate and </p><p>forsaken than it had been the first time they </p><p>had seen it. A heavy silence seemed to </p><p>brood over the whole place, a silence that </p><p>was broken at intervals by the crash and </p><p>re-echoing roar of artillery. </p><p> Telford uttered a sudden, half-choked</p><p>exclamation. </p><p> “Luk there, sorr, at the top of the roof,</p><p>will ye? There’s a piece that’s missin’, </p><p>Mi!”-501^ was l^ere no chimney at a^&gt; at </p><p> The two scouts had reached the door of</p><p>the house, and it seemed to Tony, a dull </p><p>anxiety numbing his heart, that they </p><p>started back in horror. </p><p> “Come on,” he said, “there are no Ger-</p><p>mans there anyhow.” And he hastened </p><p>on down the slope in the direction of the </p><p>farm, outstripping his men. </p><p> At the little gate leading to the front</p><p>garden, O'Connor made as if to stop him. </p><p> “Sorr, there’s nothin’ lift—nothin’.”</p><p> With a curt nod Tony passed on and</p><p>stood at the doorway peering in at what </p><p>had only a few short days before, been the </p><p>kitchen. </p><p> He felt as if some power had robbed him</p><p>of his senses. He saw, but he could not at- </p><p>tach any meaning to what was before his </p><p>eyes. The effect was clear, the cause was </p><p>lacking. </p><p> The ceiling and part of the wall opposite</p><p>had gone. The blue sky and the green trees </p><p>and a shattered bam showed in the gap. </p><p>The floor, once so white and clean, was cov- </p><p>ered with debris, rubble and plaster and </p><p>brick and woodwork. The table in the </p><p>center of the room was broken. The oak </p><p>dresser stood to all appearance undamaged, </p><p>but its neat rows of crockery ware, the cups </p><p>and saucers and dishes and jugs had been </p><p>cast down as if by some gigantic hand, </p><p>obeying some devil's -will. </p><p> Tony shook off the stupor that bound him</p><p>and entered. </p><p> Against the stove, crumpled up like a</p><p>bundle of old clothes, discarded after years </p><p>of use, thrown carelessly aside, was the little </p><p>old man, the woman's father, the stone </p><p>hearth smeared and splashed with dried </p><p>blood. </p><p> Tony stared at him with a feeling of cold</p><p>fear gripping his heart. Nor could he have </p><p>spoken, had he been ordered. </p><p> There were footsteps behind him. He</p><p>turned and saw Telford. </p><p> “God dheliver us! They're afther shel-</p><p>lin ’kthe place. Then—then, then, what in the </p><p>name of all that’s howly—what's become </p><p>of the woman what give us the dhrink?” </p><p> Through the open doorway on his left</p><p>Tony could see a pile of rubbish, like that </p><p>in the room in which he now stood, bricks </p><p>and mortar and beams of wood, with a </p><p>glimpse of the farmyard, the dark green </p><p>of the trees and the slope of the hill beyond, </p><p>taking the place of the wall which was once </p><p>there. </p><p> Nerving himself to do his duty, he en-</p><p>tered. </p><p> On her knees, crouching by the side of a</p><p>big, old-fashioned bed, was the woman. </p><p>Her whole attitude be\okened terror, a </p><p>terror that was far beyond her strength to </p><p>bear. Her face was turned away, hidden </p><p>from view, her shoulders were bowed, in </p><p>her arms she held her baby, with one hand </p><p>shielding its head. </p><p>24 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Tony approached softly, spoke to her in</p><p>a husky voice, then touched her. She did </p><p>not move. Great beads of perspiration </p><p>trickled down his cheeks, his tongue clove </p><p>to the roof of his mouth. And at last, by an </p><p>effort, he found his voice. </p><p> “What is it?" he asked hoarsely, “What</p><p>is it? Tell me, can't you?" </p><p> He tugged at her arm, tugged and tugged,</p><p>until unresisting, strangely limp, she moved </p><p>and he saw her face. Her cheeks were pale, </p><p>her eyes closed, her white teeth pressed </p><p>into her lower lip, and under the mass of </p><p>heavy golden hair, hair that was so like </p><p>Sybil's—Sybil waiting at home for news </p><p>of him—was red blood, blood that had </p><p>trickled down over her forehead, down her </p><p>other cheek, on to the bed. </p><p> Unable to bear the sight. Tony dropped</p><p>her arm and turned away. His men </p><p>watched him with curious eyes, silent, ap- </p><p>prehensive.</p><p> “God!” he whispered. “Oh, my God!</p><p>Did you see her? Did you see what they’ve </p><p>done?” </p><p> “What is it, Misther Mallagh?” said</p><p>Telford. “Ah! don’t now, don’t let it be </p><p>disturrbin’ ye. Poor things, sure, an’ </p><p>they're out of harrm’s way, an’ with their </p><p>throubles inded.” </p><p> “Both of them,” said Tony. “Both.</p><p>It was the one shell that did it. The one </p><p>shell, Telford, do you hear me? Oh, my </p><p>God! Let's get out of it. And they wouldn’t </p><p>leave when I told them. Telford, you heard </p><p>yourself, didn’t you? It isn’t my fault, it </p><p>isn’t, is it?” </p><p> He staggered out of the ruined house into</p><p>the open air, shaking in every limb, his </p><p>senses reeling. </p><p> The farm-yard was wrecked beyond re-</p><p>pairing: barns and out-houses were crum- </p><p>bling ruins. A few melancholy hens wan- </p><p>dered to and fro. A horse lay dead by the </p><p>well, its legs stretched stiffly out . </p><p> O'Connor approached slowly, a dead</p><p>rooster in one hand, his rifle in the other, his </p><p>red, dirty face strangely serious. </p><p> "Sorr, was there not a little gcrrl as well?”</p><p>he asked. </p><p> “Well!” said Tony sharply. “Well!”</p><p> “I think, sorr, that we have found her."</p><p> “Alive?”</p><p> The man gave a hard laugh. ‘'Sorr, she</p><p>is not. Alive? Mother of Jasus! Would ye </p><p>say that if ve’d seen her? She was fright- </p><p>ened, poor little gerrl, an' ran. For yer </p><p>pace of mind this night, sorr, an' for manny </p><p>a night afther, ye’ll have no wish to luk. </p><p>Does a shell give life or beauty where it </p><p>burrshts?" </p><p> “I’ve seen enough," said Tony. “I've</p><p>seen enough. There's no mercy in war, not </p><p>in tins war. They lake them all—men, </p><p>women, and even the children. Is there one </p><p>that they’d spare?" He turned on his heel </p><p>and went wearily back to the house. </p><p>“Sergeant-Major!” </p><p> “Sorr!” said Telford.</p><p> “They’ve gone, all of them.”</p><p> “The little gerrl, sorr?”</p><p> _ “Yes.” He paused. “Telford, I think</p><p>I'll leave you here, while I go on with a </p><p>dozen or so men to the top of the hill. I </p><p>just want to—to have a look the other side </p><p>of the ridge. You’d better follow me as </p><p>soon as you’ve—you’ve-” </p><p> He broke short, abruptly. His head was</p><p>throbbing as with fever. He felt sick and </p><p>dazed. Thoughts came and went haphaz-</p><p>ard. A fierce anger burned within him; a </p><p>hatred of war; a horror of what he had seen. </p><p>For he knew, as surely as if he had been </p><p>told, that never while he had life in his </p><p>body—never, sleeping or waking, uld he </p><p>forget, would he shut out of mind the things </p><p>he had seen that day. And this was war— </p><p>war, the magnificent; war that men wor- </p><p>shiped. </p><p> The Sergeant-Major was looking at him</p><p>with a curious intensity of gaze. He shiv- </p><p>ered as if chilled to the bone. </p><p> ‘‘Maybe you’ll find some spades and picks</p><p>in the barn,” he said, “or what’s left of it </p><p>—and—and any where’ll do for the grave, </p><p>Telford; anywhere you like.” </p><p>THE SouUi Irish were bivouacking </p><p>in an orchard near a small \illage. </p><p>An unwonted cheerfulness seemed to </p><p>have taken possession of the men. There </p><p>were rumors coming from where no man </p><p>knew, that in the morning the regiment was </p><p>to be sent into action with the remainder of </p><p>the division. </p><p> To Tony Mallagh, sick at heart, tortured</p><p>by his own imaginings, pacing to and fro </p><p>by himself, came Shannon. </p><p> “Tony, I want to speak to you."</p><p> Tony halted.</p><p> “Well," he said slowly, “what is it?"</p><p> The light of a fire threw a red reflection</p><p>on to his worn face. Shannon stared at </p><p>him, puzzled by his appearance. He looked </p><p> if:</p><p> *</p><p>Lieutenant Tony Mallagh </p><p>25 </p><p>ill. All the life and strength and resolution </p><p>seemed to have vanished. </p><p> “Hullo! Hullo! What's all this? What’s</p><p>the matter, Tony?” </p><p> “The matter!” Tony answered in a dull</p><p>voice. “The matter, sir. Nothing.” </p><p> The older man took him by the arm.</p><p>“Yes, there is.” he said. “Better tell me. </p><p>Perhaps I can help.” </p><p> Tony laughed softly. Help! The very</p><p>idea amused him. “Shannon,” he said </p><p>dropping his voice. “I’m sick of it. That's </p><p>what’s the matter. I’m sick of everything. </p><p>There!” </p><p> Shannon whistled under his breath.</p><p>“Steady the Buffs! Come on, Tony, </p><p>what is it?” </p><p> Tony, gazing across the open fields at the</p><p>distant hills dark against the blue-gray sky, </p><p>wondered if it were over those same hills </p><p>that the South Irish were destined to fight</p><p>their way on the morrow. </p><p> “There was a farmhouse in a small val-</p><p>ley,” he said. “I was there three days ago. </p><p>I don’t know when I’ve seen any place I </p><p>Liked so much—green woods, yellow corn- </p><p>fields, a farmhouse, covered with ivy, an </p><p>orchard. The man was away fighting. The </p><p>wife looked after the farm. You under- </p><p>stand, sib. She did all the work, everything, </p><p>and wasn’t frightened. She had an old </p><p>father, a cripple, and two kiddies. The </p><p>Germans wouldn’t harm her, she knew. </p><p>And she was as happy and busy as if there </p><p>were no war within a hundred miles. And </p><p>then today-” </p><p> “Well,” said Shannon quietly. “To-</p><p>day?” </p><p> “Today!” said Tony. “We went that</p><p>way again. The back of the house was </p><p>blown to pieces. A batten,' had had the </p><p>wrong range or something. Even the air- </p><p>men might have spotted the farm. Or </p><p>they might have thought— Oh! God </p><p>knows! I don’t. I daren’t think of it, too </p><p>much. The old man was dead. So was the </p><p>woman. She had her arms around her baby </p><p>to save it from the shells. The baby was </p><p>dead. And in the garden was the little girl. </p><p>They didn’t let me see her. She was dead, </p><p>of course. Oh, yes, she was dead right </p><p>enough. I hat s what we found when we </p><p>passed there today. </p><p> “And me—God forgive me! ThereVe</p><p>been times when I thought that war brought </p><p>out all that was best in man. Today—” he </p><p>shipped his fingers—“today, Shannon, I </p><p>understood what war was. They’d gone, </p><p>each one of them. Wiped out. Smashed. </p><p>And at the end of the war, perhaps, the </p><p>husband will come home to find—what? </p><p>Nothing. Only the grave and a wooden </p><p>cross.” </p><p> “But, Tony, listen.” In spite of himself</p><p>Shannon was troubled. “Tony, you know </p><p>what war is by this time, don’t you? It's </p><p>cruel, yes, but-" </p><p> “Cruel!” said Tony. “So it seems.</p><p>Shannon, I wish you could have seen that </p><p>poor girl today, with the shell wound in her </p><p>head and her arms around her poor dead </p><p>baby. What harm had she done? None </p><p>at all. She thought she was safe. Who'd </p><p>touch a poor woman who had to work hard? </p><p>God would preserve her. That's what she </p><p>said. And a battery two miles away, per- </p><p>haps, killed her. </p><p> “I’LL never forget, Shannon. Never.</p><p>And, Shannon, when I saw her that first</p><p>time, it came over me that she looked like </p><p>Sybil. Yes. It’s a fact. Like Sybil. That </p><p>makes it worse. War's killing women and </p><p>little children and old men. Shells dropping </p><p>on little houses. What’s it matter to us? </p><p>We re men and we’re strong. War’s good. </p><p>It gives us a chance to win medals and Y. </p><p>C.’s and quick promotion. But the women </p><p>—God help them! No one else will. And </p><p>perhaps a' home, in London, Sybil is won- </p><p>dering if I’m alive or dead, or—what? And </p><p>—I dunno, I feel that my nerve’s broken for </p><p>good and all. I’m done.” </p><p> “As bad as that, old chap? " Shannon</p><p>patted his shoulder. “Tony, it’s no use </p><p>fretting. You’ve got to turn in. And—and </p><p>you’ll be feeling better in the morning. You </p><p>see if you aren’t. War’s war, old son-” </p><p> Something seemed to snap in Tony's</p><p>brain. He laughed harshly and walked oil, </p><p>leaving the other staring after him. bewil- </p><p>dered and worried and somewhat frightened </p><p>by his manner. </p><p> A square, thick-set figure passed him by.</p><p> “Is that you, Telford?”</p><p> “Sorr.” The company Sergeant-Major</p><p>saluted. </p><p> "Telford, what's happened 10 Mr. Mal-</p><p>lagh?” </p><p> “He was all right this afthernoon. sorr.'</p><p>said Telford. </p><p> “You noticed nothing different about</p><p>him then?” </p><p> “Well, sorr, mebbe he was a bit quiet</p><p>like aithcr we seen where the Gemnans had </p><p>Adventure </p><p>dhropped a few shells on top of a house. </p><p>An’ 1 don't wondher. It wasn’t a sight ye </p><p>could luk at an’ not feel, sorr.” </p><p> “Oh. I see! Thank you, Telford. It</p><p>doesn’t matter, I thought perhaps he was </p><p>sick, that’s all.” </p><p> The Sergeant-Major drifted off. For</p><p>some minutes Shannon did not move. And </p><p>as he pondered on what Tony Mallagh had </p><p>said, there came to his mind the thought of </p><p>Sybil waiting at home and the memory of </p><p>the evening when they had sat opposite </p><p>each other in the small drawing-room and he </p><p>had heard from her own lips why she had </p><p>wanted him. Little more than a month </p><p>had passed since then. It seemed impossi- </p><p>ble. Whole years could not have made </p><p>more difference to her husband. And the </p><p>future! </p><p> At that moment the future seemed to</p><p>Shannon dark and dreary, full of misery </p><p>and doubt and uncertainty. Supposing</p><p>that on the morrow when the South Irish </p><p>went into action Tony were once more to </p><p>show himself a coward! Supposing that this </p><p>time there would be no hiding it from others! </p><p>Supposing he turned and ran, not in the </p><p>gray of the dawn, but in broad day in full </p><p>view of his company! Supposing he ran </p><p>and lived! Would even Sybil consider his </p><p>life worth the price he would have to pay? </p><p> Yet if ever a man had showed fear in his</p><p>words and looks and manner, thatman was </p><p>Tony Mallagh. </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>THE HONOR OF THE SOUTH IRISH </p><p>TO THE man who does the actual fight- </p><p>ing, who goes into the firing-line and </p><p>with rifle and bayonet endeavors to drive </p><p>back the foe, a battle is but a grim dream, </p><p>incoherent and vague, a series of discon- </p><p>nected incidents. His range of observation </p><p>is limited. He knows what is happening in </p><p>his immediate neighborhood and nowhere </p><p>else. His regiment or brigade may be </p><p>hurled forward in a fierce onslaught, their </p><p>losses may appal him—surely this is the </p><p>hardest fighting that man has ever seen— </p><p>yet the attack may be but a feint, a mere </p><p>pretense to cover the real attack elsewhere. </p><p> He and his comrades may be sacrificed</p><p>so that others may win. He may be ordered </p><p>to advance and retire, and then to advance </p><p>once more, to all appearance without rea- </p><p>son. And what he may think a defeat, </p><p>judging from what he has seen with his own </p><p>eyes, from the losses in his own regiment or </p><p>company, may be as great a victory as ever </p><p>army won. </p><p> Thus it was with the men of the South</p><p>Irish. For, although they were in the firing </p><p>line, one of the leading regiments in the </p><p>movement, they knew but little of what was </p><p>happening, even in their own immediate </p><p>front. </p><p> By noon they had reached the shelter of a</p><p>wood where they were told to wait. Later </p><p>the German field-guns opened a heavy fire. </p><p>A few men were killed and a few more </p><p>wounded, and the stretcher-bearers were </p><p>busy. </p><p> Murmurs came from the ranks.</p><p> “The curse of Cromwell on all Gerrmans!</p><p>Where are they now? Why is there nothin’ </p><p>to be shootin’ at?” </p><p> “Are we niver to go forward at all?”</p><p> “Sure, it’s naythur shell-fire nor mu/keth-</p><p>ry nor yit charrgin’ that’s the w'orr^t part of </p><p>bein’ in acthion; ’tis the iverlastin seuin’ </p><p>around doin’ nothin’ that wears a man more</p><p>than annything.” </p><p> Shannon came hurrying up just as a shell</p><p>burst among the trees some yards in front </p><p>of where a dozen or so privates were lying. </p><p>They rose to their feet as one man and r^n </p><p>back. One fell on his face and did not move. </p><p>From the enemy’s position in front the </p><p>crackle of musketry broke out. Bullets were </p><p>wailing and whistling through the air with </p><p>the sound as of a swarm of monstrous ilies. </p><p>A bugler coughed and slid over into a limp </p><p>heap. </p><p> “Where are you men going?” asked Shan-</p><p>non sternly. "Get back at once, do you </p><p>hear? Get back! Right back now!” They </p><p>moved sullenly to where they had been </p><p>waiting. </p><p> Shannon w’ondering if anything had hap-</p><p>pened to Tony Mallagh let his eyes wander </p><p>quickly from side to side. The men lay in a </p><p>natural gully or ditch that zigzagged along </p><p>the slope of the hill. Some talked in low </p><p>voices, others puffed at their pipes in si- </p><p>lence, a few unmindful of the bullets, dozed. </p><p>The sky showed blue in the gaps of the green </p><p>overhead. Through the trees wrere glimpses </p><p>of meadow's and cornfields and woods, held </p><p>by the enemy, all faint and flickering in the </p><p>heat haze. </p><p> Shannon turned impatiently. Two men</p><p>were carrying the wounded bugler away on </p><p>Lieutenant Tony Mallagh </p><p> a stretcher. He watched them with a little</p><p> frown. And then he saw the man for whom</p><p> he had been looking.</p><p> Seated on a fallen tree-trunk some little</p><p> distance behind the line of waiting soldiers,</p><p> his shoulders bowed, his chin resting on the</p><p> palm of his right hand, his elbow resting</p><p> on his knees, was Tony Mallagh.</p><p> Shannon, stirred at last to take action,</p><p> strode toward him.</p><p> Tony raised his head as he came up. His</p><p> face was gray under the brown, worn and</p><p> wretched; lines showed about his eyes and</p><p> mouth. His whole appearance gave the im-</p><p> pression of fear, fear that had left him with-</p><p> out energy or strength of mind. Or so it</p><p> seemed to Shannon.</p><p> “Tony,” he said, and he spoke in a whis-</p><p> per so that no one might overhear. “What</p><p> the devil are you doing here? Why aren’t</p><p> you looking after your men? Don’t you</p><p> know that they’re under fire, and getting</p><p> restless? What’s wrong with you?” Shan-</p><p> non’s anger flared up, white-hot. Only by</p><p> an effort could he control his voice. “If</p><p> \ you're a coward, for Heaven’s sake don’t</p><p> let the men see it. Pull yourself together,</p><p> man. Don’t you understand what I’m say-</p><p> ing?”</p><p> The words were strong, but no stronger</p><p> than the case warranted. The time for</p><p> sympathy had gone by. Only shame, the</p><p> sense that others had guessed his secret,</p><p> would drive Tony to do his duty. Better</p><p> by far to lose a friend than that that friend</p><p> should lose the respect not only of others</p><p> but of himself. And if what he said had no</p><p> effect, then nothing would. The case was</p><p> hopeless.</p><p> Tony stood up slowly and gazed about</p><p> him in a dazed way, as if he had not grasped</p><p> the meaning of what was said to him.</p><p> ^ I ve done nothing, have I?” he muttered.</p><p> “Nothing!” Shannon dug his heel into</p><p> the soft moss covered with pine-needles.</p><p> “That’s just it. You’ve done nothing.</p><p> We re going forward presently to take that</p><p> village, and you’ve-well got to set an</p><p> example. See! If you’re too scared to do</p><p> what’s right, how the blazes do you expect</p><p> your men to?”</p><p> Tony understood. Shannon, poor, dense</p><p> fool, thought that he shirked the fight. He,</p><p> Tony Mallagh, afraid! He laughed. After</p><p> seeing the house with the dead woman who</p><p> had looked like Sybil! He was a soldier,</p><p> ghting for his home, for the girl who was</p><p>dearer to him than anything in the wide </p><p>world. </p><p> “You don’t think I’m afraid, do you,</p><p>Shannon?” he said. </p><p> “Yes,” said Shannon bluntly. “1 do.</p><p>And, man, think of Sybil. It’s for her sake, </p><p>Tony, as much as ours. How would she like </p><p>to hear that when you were wanted you </p><p>failed?” </p><p> Tony was smiling, his head slightly tilted</p><p>on one side. </p><p> “So you think I’m afraid, do you? Good</p><p>God! After what I saw yesterday. Why, </p><p>man, all that I'm afraid of is that the Ger- </p><p>mans mayn’t wait. That’s all. And you </p><p>think I’m a coward, do you? Why?'’ His </p><p>eyes glinted with a curious anger. “Be- </p><p>cause of what I was fool enough to tell </p><p>you?” </p><p> “Because of a good many things. Your</p><p>looks to start with. I saw you looking like </p><p>you are now, once before. I never told you, </p><p>I never intended to tell you. but I must. </p><p>You remember that morning when some of </p><p>our fellows bolted and I picked you up with </p><p>your head all cut? Tony, you were running </p><p>then. If you’d only been trying to rally</p><p>the men you’d have been back long before </p><p>you got as far as all that. Understand! </p><p>That’s why I’m frightened now. Because </p><p>you look the same as you did then.” </p><p> “All right!” said Tony. “Sorry if I’ve</p><p>made you think I’m worse than I am. I did </p><p>run that time I know. Don't judge me. </p><p>though, by what I was then. Maybe you </p><p>think that I’m still a coward! I think—” </p><p>here he laughed lightly—“I think that I'll </p><p>prove you’re wrong. And I'm going to </p><p>prove it for Sybil’s sake as much as my </p><p>own.” </p><p> “Well and good,” said Shannon. “I’m</p><p>glad to hear it.” </p><p> “You remember the greengrocer's horse?”</p><p>said Tony. </p><p> “Well! What's that got to do with it?”</p><p> “Oh, nothing!” said Tony. “Nothing.”</p><p> Shannon turned and walked off, feeling</p><p>dissatisfied and worried and for the moment </p><p>not quite certain that he had taken the right </p><p>course. He had angered Tony, he knew, and </p><p>hurt him, yet he had fio great hope that </p><p>what he had said would awaken a sense of </p><p>duty. </p><p> When he had gone some little distance</p><p>he looked back. Tony was standing in the </p><p>same attitude, head on one side, hands </p><p>behind his back, staring after him. </p><p>Adventure </p><p>AFTER the day’s fight was over, </p><p>the General in command of the </p><p>division rode up and congratulated </p><p>the Suuth Irish Fusiliers, or what remained </p><p>of them. They had achieved what in other </p><p>Wars would have been deemed the impossi- </p><p>ble. The sacrifice they had made had not </p><p>been in vain. He was proud to remember, </p><p>so he said, that he himself had served in </p><p>their ranks. </p><p> And the remnants of the regiment, a</p><p>bare two hundred and fifty men, ragged and </p><p>war-worn and tired, stood to attention in </p><p>the streets of a battered village and felt </p><p>very proud of themselves and very hungry </p><p>and very thirsty. As for what they had </p><p>done, that was nothing. They had fought </p><p>and driven the enemy before them, as they </p><p>had promised always if the chance were </p><p>given them. </p><p> If the General was surprised, they at</p><p>least w-ere not. Were they not the Royal </p><p>South Irish Fusiliers—the Tipperary Ti- </p><p>gers? In their hearts they pitied the Ger- </p><p>mans who had had to face their onslaught. </p><p>Poor fools! Did they think they could </p><p>withstand an Irish regiment with the</p><p>bayonet? </p><p> In the last wild rush when they had been</p><p>launched across open ground at the enemy’s </p><p>trenches, with their bayonets glinting in the </p><p>yellow evening sunshine, the deep roar of </p><p>their cheering swelling loud above the crack- </p><p>le of musketry carried a message both to </p><p>friend and foe. The South Irish Fusiliers </p><p>were charging. A savage exultant yell told </p><p>that they had met the Germans and that </p><p>the trench was theirs, and the regiments on </p><p>either side, line after line, took up the </p><p>shout and dashed forward to do their share. </p><p> "But,” as the South Irish put it, "we</p><p>was the fellas that showed thim the way. </p><p>An’ it was Misther Mallagh what made us </p><p>do what we did!" </p><p> "Ah! An’ what kind of madness wras it</p><p>that dhrove him on?” </p><p> "Himself knows! Did ye see him whin he</p><p>came back and sthud with the bullets whist- </p><p>lin’ all round him, as cool as ye plaze, an’ </p><p>axed if we was wishin’ to live foriver an’ </p><p>was it a tay-parthy or a battle we wanted? </p><p>A gran’ young orf’cer an’ no mistake!” </p><p>“Indade, an’ ye sphake no more than the </p><p>thruth. But it was not a tay-parthy a man </p><p>wants more than wance in a lifetime. The </p><p>cosht was a dale too high.’ </p><p> They had lost heavily from the very mo-</p><p>ment that the word had sent them forward </p><p>out of the shelter of the wood toward the </p><p>Germans. Their advance through the </p><p>harvest fields and meadows and orchards </p><p>had been stubbornly contested. They lost </p><p>their colonel, shot] through the lungs, a </p><p>major, two captains and three subalterns. </p><p>No more than six officers, unwounded, </p><p>survived.. </p><p> And always in the very forefront of the</p><p>battle went Tony Mallagh, no longer carry- </p><p>ing a sword, but a rifle and bayonet, fierce </p><p>in attack, savagely intolerant of delay, </p><p>stern, implacable, and disdainful of life. </p><p> Once, when the regiment had carried a</p><p>village after fierce hand-to-hand fighting in </p><p>the streets and houses, and the men of his </p><p>company had swarmed around him, cheer- </p><p>ing wildly, he had glared at them with cold </p><p>eyes and growled angrily, like some dog </p><p>robbed of a bone. The stupor of battle </p><p>w'hich is worse than drunkeness held him </p><p>in its grip. Did they know that the were </p><p>wasting time or not? he had said. Were </p><p>they tired of being soldiers, or what? </p><p>Would they like their tea and cakes now, or </p><p>would they wait till later when the table </p><p>was laid and their bibs were ironed?</p><p> All these things and others were remem-</p><p>bered of him after he had led the last charge. </p><p> Late in the afternoon the brigade crossed</p><p>a stream in the face of heavy fire and went </p><p>forward, driving the Germans before them </p><p>through the trees. </p><p> The sun was setting by the time they had</p><p>cleared the wood of its defenders. </p><p> A strange hush had fallen on the field of</p><p>battle, a hush that w-as broken only by the </p><p>incessant roar of the guns. Yet the men of </p><p>the South Irish streaming onward, grimly </p><p>silent, knew that the real struggle was still </p><p>before them. </p><p> At the edge of the wood they found in</p><p>front of them a stretch of open ground, slop- </p><p>ing slightly upward, bare of all cover, and a </p><p>fierce storm of bullets from the hedgerows </p><p>and orchards and houses swept their ranks. </p><p> They fell back in disorder to the shelter</p><p>of the trees. Urged to fresh effort by their </p><p>officers, they poured in volley after volley, </p><p>and started forward once more, only to </p><p>waver and break and go back, leaving be- </p><p>hind their dead. German marksmanship </p><p>they despised, but this hell of fire from rifles </p><p>and machine-guns wfas more than man bom </p><p>of woman could face and live. Or so they </p><p>had thought. All that soldiers could do they </p><p>Lieutenant Tony Mallagh </p><p>29 </p><p>had done. They must wait for reinforce- </p><p>ments. </p><p> But this time Tony Mallagh, bare-</p><p>headed, grimed with sweat and dirt, but as </p><p>cool and calm as on parade, smiling a little </p><p>so men said later when they talked it over, </p><p>did not retire with his company. He stood </p><p>by himself, a mark for a half-score of </p><p>machine-guns, perhaps more, and rifles </p><p>without number, upright in the midst of </p><p>the fallen. </p><p> The men had watched him, wondering</p><p>when would come the bullet that would lay </p><p>him low. Some had shouted for him to get </p><p>back, that he would be killed, that they </p><p>themselves could not shoot for fear of </p><p>hitting him. </p><p> “Are you afraid, then, South Irish?” be</p><p>had laughed. “Do you want German con- </p><p>scripts to boast that they licked you in fair </p><p>fight? Are you so fond of your miserable </p><p>carcases?” Here he had raised his hand to </p><p>his face and they had seen the red smear of </p><p>blood. Again he had laughed. “Good-by, </p><p>then. I’d be ashamed to be seen dead in </p><p>the company of a pack of-cowards like </p><p>you are! And you call yourself Irish! I’m</p><p>proud to know that you’ll not go where I’m </p><p>going.” </p><p> He turned with a little gesture of con-</p><p>tempt and walked deliberately toward the </p><p>enemy, rifle in hand. </p><p> A young subaltern shouted, “Don’t let</p><p>him go alone, South Irish!” Jumping to his </p><p>feet he started after him but fell with a </p><p>bullet through his heart. A dozen men fol- </p><p>lowed. </p><p>^r] ONE after another they dropped. </p><p>And after that not even discipline, </p><p>n°t even direct orders from their </p><p>officers, would have held back the South </p><p>Irish. Cowards, were they! They would </p><p>prove that whatever they might be they </p><p>were far from being cowards. </p><p> As they went forward with the wild,</p><p>savage yell that gave warning far and wide </p><p>of the coming of the bayonets, Tony Mal- </p><p>agh glanced back over his shoulder and </p><p>laughed. Then he began to run. </p><p> Men fell by scores in the rush across the</p><p>open; he was not touched. Neither </p><p>machine-guns nor rifles brought him down. </p><p>Bleeding from his wound he reached the </p><p>German position well in advance of the </p><p>nearest man. Using both the butt of his </p><p>rifle and his bayonet, he fought his way into </p><p>the trench. A swarm of gray-clad figures </p><p>seemed to rise up and engulf him. And </p><p>that was the last seen of Tony Mallagh for </p><p>some time. </p><p> Like a wave breaking on a rock-bound</p><p>shore, the South Irish burst through the </p><p>enemy. Those that awaited their coming </p><p>died. Those that fled they chased through </p><p>the streets of the little village. A few es- </p><p>caped, but not many. It was a fight after </p><p>their own hearts, a great and glorious fight. </p><p>That the South Irish Fusiliers existed no </p><p>longer save as a mere fragment of a battal- </p><p>ion mattered not. No other troops could </p><p>have done what they had done. They were </p><p>proud of themselves, and justly. </p><p> Telford and a couple of wounded privates</p><p>found Tony Mallagh under a pile of corpses </p><p>in the orchard at the back of the trench. </p><p> “He’s dead, poor fella!”</p><p> “Indade, an’ he’s not. Not yit, at laste.</p><p>Mother of God! Luk at the wounds that </p><p>he has.” </p><p> Tony opened his eyes as Shannon came</p><p>up through the trees. He dropped on to his </p><p>knees by Tony’s side. </p><p> “Tony, old man, are you badly hurt?”</p><p> “Hurt!-' whispered Tony. “No."</p><p> He lay on the grass under the trees, his</p><p>head in Telford’s lap. And seeing him, </p><p>there was no one present who did not know </p><p>what the end must be. </p><p> “Take it aisy, sorr. There'll be a docthor</p><p>along in a minute.” </p><p> “Oh, Tony, Tony!’’ said Shannon bit-</p><p>terly. </p><p> “S’sh! What’s that?’’ From their left</p><p>came a deep roar of cheers. </p><p> “They're afther takin’ another trinch.”</p><p>said Telford. “That ull be the Cumber- </p><p>lands.” </p><p> “Shannon," said Tony, “I can’t live, LI</p><p>know. I want to, and yet—yet somehow </p><p>I don’t. It was the house and the woman </p><p>who was killed—remember! And the green- </p><p>grocer’s horse at Portsmouth.” His mind </p><p>seemed to be wandering. </p><p> “Not long now," muttered Telford.</p><p>“Not very long, poor bhov!” </p><p> For a while no one spoke. The cheering</p><p>had died down. Only the sullen boom of </p><p>the field-guns thudded on. The sun had </p><p>set and the sky was a brilliant crimson over </p><p>the hills. .Another regiment was passing, </p><p>rank after rank of dark figures against the </p><p>bluish-gray of the trees. The dying man </p><p>stirred uneasily, and Shannon bent nearer, </p><p>Adventure </p><p>so that he might catch the least whisper. </p><p> "I wasn't afraid, Shannon, was 1? 1</p><p>wasn't this time, at least. I was before, </p><p>though.1’ </p><p> "Afraid!” said Shannon. “I never saw</p><p>anything so splendid in all my life. We </p><p>wouldn’t have won the trench but for you, </p><p>Tony. We couldn’t have.” </p><p> “Something’s fretting him,” said Telford.</p><p> "Tony,” said Shannon suddenly, "is</p><p>there any message for—for Sybil?” </p><p> "Sybil!” said Tony. “Sybil!” He stared</p><p>at Shannon with a look of doubt, almost as </p><p>if the words he had heard held no meaning. </p><p> “Yes. Is there nothing I can do?”</p><p>Surely he would be thinking of Sybil, think- </p><p>ing and wondering and worrying! Surely </p><p>it would help him if he knew that any mes- </p><p>sage he might give would reach her! “She’ll </p><p>be very proud of you, Tony,” he said. </p><p> A wistful little smile crept into Tony’s</p><p>face. </p><p> “Don't you understand, Shannon, I’ll be</p><p>seeing her myself? I’ll tell her—yes, I’ll </p><p>tell her everything. Good and bad, eh? </p><p>She’ll be glad, won’t she?” </p><p> Shannon caught his breath sharply. Poor</p><p>old Tony! He was going out at last then. </p><p>Did he think, though, that he could live to</p><p>see Sybil? </p><p> “He’s wandherin’ a thrifle,” whispered</p><p>Telford. </p><p> No one spoke. The end was very near.</p><p>Then with ari effort Tony tried to raise him- </p><p>self. A gleam of amusement showed in his </p><p>tired eyes. </p><p> “Dirty work, fighting," he murmured.</p><p>“Glad I didn’t order a new kit, eh?” He </p><p>closed his eyes. </p><p> The little group waited for a while in si-</p><p>lence. Then Telford lowered the boy’s </p><p>head on to the grass. </p><p> “He’s gone,” he said. “An’ but for him</p><p>we wouldn't be where we are now.” </p><p> “God help the girl!" said Shannon</p><p>hoarsely. “It’s hard on her. Awful hard! </p><p>Poor old Tony!” </p><p> A subaltern with a bandaged face hurried</p><p>toward them. </p><p> "Is Captain Shannon there?” he called.</p><p> "Well,” said Shannon.</p><p> “The General’s coming this way, sir, so</p><p>I thought I’d tell you. You see, sir, Major </p><p>Carne’s wounded, and you’re the senior </p><p>surviving officer, and-’’ </p><p> “AH right,” said Shannon wearily. He</p><p>stood up. "I won't be a minute.” </p><p> One of the privates stooped down and</p><p>gazed into Tony’s face. </p><p> "Poor young fella! Hi- was happy whin</p><p>he wint wesht. Luk at the smile on him. </p><p>Wud he belaive he was afther doin’ all </p><p>what he has done?” </p><p> “We’ve losht heavily this day, Path-</p><p>rick, said another, “but there’s none we </p><p>cud have spared the liss than this wan.” </p><p> ‘‘I worldlier did they hear the banshee</p><p>lasht night in Kerry. Himself comes from </p><p>Kerry, I know.” </p><p> Tony Mallagh was buried where he had</p><p>fallen in the orchard. It was a starlit night. </p><p>The guns had ceased. A cool wind blew </p><p>from the north. </p><p> Sick at heart, Shannon turned from the</p><p>grave. It would be very lonely without </p><p>Tony Mallagh. Never before had he real- </p><p>ized what Tony had been to him. Some- </p><p>thing had gone out of his life, something </p><p>that could never be replaced. And then he </p><p>remembered Sybil. </p><p> The thought of what the news of Ton-. s</p><p>death would mean to her was like a kniie- </p><p>thrust in the heart. Had he done al! in hi? </p><p>power to keep the promise he hu i made? </p><p>Had he tried to do his best to save h-. r </p><p>husband from running into danger? Ha&gt;: </p><p>he not rather sent him to his death? Shan -</p><p>non pondered. </p><p> It had been no feeling of cowardice that</p><p>had gripped Tony that morning, he knew, </p><p>rather a dumb loathing of inaction. But </p><p>supposing that it had been fear! Supposing </p><p>that Tony had deserted his men in battle! </p><p>Supposing that Sybil had heard! Would </p><p>life have been worth living, for her, or for </p><p>him? </p><p>ZTpn WAR was glorious. War was great. </p><p>fjT* And war was hell. But Tony Mal- </p><p>jagh Was dead, and Sybil must be </p><p>told, and from him, Shannon, who would </p><p>have given all he possessed to win her grati- </p><p>tude and thanks, must come the news. </p><p> He entered the little house in the village</p><p>where he was to spend the night. The room </p><p>still bore the marks of fighting. On the </p><p>boards were dark stains. Bullet holes </p><p>scarred the plaster of the walls. German </p><p>rifles and helmets lay in one corner. A sol- </p><p>dier servant was lighting a lamp. </p><p> Shannon seated himself at the table and</p><p>searched in his pockets for pen and writing- </p><p>tablet. </p><p> If he must write, it would be as well to</p><p>Lieutenant Tony Mallagh </p><p>31 </p><p>write while he had the chance. Tomorrow </p><p>it might be his turn to die. Waiting would </p><p>only postpone the agony. Then he wrote: </p><p>Dear Mrs. Mallagh: </p><p> I am sitting in a little French cottage in a village</p><p>which the South Irish have just carried at the point </p><p>of the bayonet, writing a letter that will bring j'ou </p><p>the iaddest news you have ever had. </p><p> Tony is dead. He died a glorious death. But</p><p>for him we would_never have taken the position. </p><p> And what else could he say? Shannon</p><p>stared blindly at the white paper before him. </p><p>A subaltern came slowly toward the table. </p><p>“Lord! I'm done in.” </p><p> Shannon looked at him.</p><p> “Tired, eh! You did well today, very</p><p>well.” </p><p> The boy's face flushed under the mask of</p><p>dirt. </p><p> “Thank you, sir. But of course—we</p><p>none of us did very' much compared with </p><p>poor old Ton}'. My hat! That was great. </p><p>I never saw anything like it. He told me </p><p>this morning early while we were in that </p><p>wood that he didn’t think he’d ever see an- </p><p>other sunset. Said something seemed to </p><p>tell him that he wasn’t meant to live. And </p><p>there was something about a house that </p><p>he’d seen and a woman who was killed. I </p><p>dunno’, I think it had got on his nerves, and</p><p>all he wanted to do was to kill Germans. </p><p>Queer, wasn’t it?” </p><p> “Don’t understand. Don’t understand</p><p>at all,” said Shannon. “And he died know- </p><p>ing his wife was at home waiting. He was </p><p>all she had in the world—and now he’s taken </p><p>away from her. Rough luck on her though. </p><p>It always is on the women—always.” </p><p> “Poor old Tony!” said the boy. “I’ll</p><p>never forget, never, the way he walked off </p><p>by himself, as cool as you please, and then </p><p>iaughed when he found we were coming </p><p>after him.” </p><p> The regimental Quartermaster, a stout,</p><p>square-shouldered, round-faced little man, </p><p>bustled in. </p><p> “Hullo, O'Brien,” said Shannon; “where</p><p>on earth have you come from?” </p><p> The little man was angry.</p><p> “Isn't it my luck at all'? Another fight,</p><p>the besht of the lot, an’ me out of it, fooling </p><p>about afther supplies. They’re saying, </p><p>though, that half the battalion's wiped out? </p><p>Is that so?” </p><p> “Yes,” Shannon nodded drearily. “We</p><p>don’t know for certain yet. The Colonel’s </p><p>gone. I'm the senior officer left.” </p><p> The Quartermaster dropped into a chair.</p><p> “An’ me out of it all. I’d have given a</p><p>month’s pay to be in it. An’ ye charrged </p><p>across open ground, did you, an’ took their </p><p>trench? Well, well!” </p><p> “We wouldn’t have done it but for Tony</p><p>Mallagh, though,” said the subaltern. </p><p> “You don't say!” said the Quartermaster.</p><p>And he listened with wide open eyes while </p><p>the story was told. At its finish he brought </p><p>his hand down with a crash on to the table. </p><p>“God! That’s the bravest thing that I ever </p><p>heard tell of. Will they give him the Cross, </p><p>do ye think? To his wife, I mean! He de- </p><p>serves it. An’ me out of it all! It's a </p><p>shame.” </p><p> The litUe man's grief was very real.</p><p> Shannon turned once more to his writ-</p><p>ing. </p><p> “Oh! By the same token, I’ve some let-</p><p>ters here which I brought with me." He </p><p>took out a small packet. “There’s one for </p><p>Captain Shannon, two for—yes, yes, one </p><p>for-” </p><p> “Any for me?” asked the subaltern</p><p>quickly. “Two! Good biz!” </p><p> “An’,” said the Quartermaster. “Here’s</p><p>wan that I have for Tony Mallagh himself. </p><p>What had I better do with it? He passed </p><p>it over to Shannon. </p><p> The handwriting seemed strangely fa-</p><p>miliar. Suannon frowned as he tried to re- </p><p>member where he had seen it before. An- </p><p>other letter, lying on the table caught his </p><p>eye. </p><p> “It’s the same as this, isn't it?" he said.</p><p>“Why, good Lord! It's from Mrs. Carne. </p><p>Did I tell you her husband was wounded? </p><p>O’Brien, was there no letter for Tony from </p><p>his wife—no other letter, at all?” </p><p> “Not so far as I’m aware,” said the</p><p>Quartermaster. “Nothin’ more for the; </p><p>mess at all, save some parcels that are corn- </p><p>in’ on later." </p><p> Shannon felt as if a cold hand had touched</p><p>his heart. </p><p> “I don’t know,” he said, “I don't know,</p><p>but I don’t like it.” He paused. “Look </p><p>here, I’m going to open this letter and see </p><p>what it says. I’m writing to Mrs. Mal- </p><p>lagh now, you see/and-" </p><p> He opened the envelope with clumsy</p><p>fingers. </p><p> For a brief moment he could not see to</p><p>read. The words were all blurred and un- </p><p>certain. Then the mist cleared. And a sick </p><p>horror came over him. </p><p>32 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> It was not a long letter; just a few lines</p><p>that were to have brought grief and sad- </p><p>ness and suffering, the greatest he would </p><p>ever know, to Tony Mallagh. Sybil was </p><p>dead. The illness had been short. Indeed, </p><p>there had been no illness at all. She had </p><p>said she was tired and had lain down on her </p><p>bed to rest. Later, when they came to look </p><p>for her, she was dead. So the Major’s wife </p><p>had written. She grieved more than she </p><p>could say. She knew what it would mean </p><p>to one so fur away, yet she had thought it </p><p>her duty to write. </p><p> The letter fell from Shannon’s lingers on</p><p>to the floor. He stared blindly across the </p><p>room, seeing nothing, only the face of the </p><p>girl whom he had loved, smiling tenderly, </p><p>with her blue eyes full of sadness and pity. </p><p> He rested his head in his hands and tried</p><p>to think. </p><p> Some one touched him on the shoulder.</p><p>A voice spoke to him. </p><p> Why wouldn’t they leave him alone?</p><p>Couldn’t they see that his heart was bro- </p><p>ken? Didn’t they know that the girl—the </p><p>sweetest and dearest girl in the world was </p><p>dead? </p><p> And then something seemed to rise up and</p><p>choke him. Sybil was dead, yes. But </p><p>would that make any difference—to him?</p><p>Why? She was Tony’s wife, and nothing </p><p>to him at all. Her husband was dead, and </p><p>she was dead, and no one could wish ihings </p><p>different from what they were. And Tony </p><p>—Tony had said that he w'ould see her soon, </p><p>that there was no message. Why? Had he </p><p>know n just at the last, or what? </p><p> Shannon lowered his hands.</p><p> “Yes,” he said huskily. “Yes, did you</p><p>say anything?” </p><p> “Is it bad news you have in the letter?”</p><p>asked the little Quartermaster. “You're </p><p>lookin’ ill.” </p><p> “Bad!” said Shannon fiercely. “Bad!</p><p>Good God, no! Why, it’s the best news </p><p>I've ever had in my life. Sybil—Tony Mal- </p><p>lagh’s wife is dead. You understand? She's </p><p>dead. And I’m glad.” </p><p> He rose to his feet and walked slowly out</p><p>into the darkness. </p><p>AN </p><p>OCCASIONAL </p><p>HERO </p><p>M J Vi°htman </p><p>T MAY have been his unkempt </p><p>appearance, or it may have </p><p>been the slouch in his manner </p><p>as he casually supervised the </p><p>work of a gang of Filipino truckmen, per- </p><p>haps it was a combination of the two which </p><p>irritated W’hite, the chief of the Lighthouse </p><p>Service. </p><p> “WTiy do you hire such fellow's?” he snap-</p><p>ped, indicating with slight backward nod </p><p>of his head the lanky American in dirty </p><p>khaki. </p><p> Farley, the assistant purchasing agent,</p><p>followed with his glance the direction of </p><p>White’s nod. </p><p> “Oh,” he said, “partly because we need</p><p>m </p><p>An Occasional Hero </p><p>33 </p><p>them and partly because this Bureau is a </p><p>sort of charity organization. That particu- </p><p>lar one, Cropsey, was wished on us by the </p><p>Governor-General’s office. He’s an ex-sol- </p><p>dier, and not a bad sort. He’s been here </p><p>for a couple of months and hasn’t gotten </p><p>drunk yet.” </p><p> White’s blue eyes glinted.</p><p> “They don’t wish any of them off on me,”</p><p>he said. “I’ll have no beach-combers on </p><p>my pay-roll, and I indicated as much to </p><p>Calvin when he sent his first one down. He </p><p>hasn’t tried it since.” </p><p> They were young men, as are most work-</p><p>ers in those tropical islands where at forty</p><p>a man usually begins to show unmistakable </p><p>signs of wearing out; and they both gave </p><p>an impression of self-reliance and absorbing </p><p>interest in their work. But here the resem- </p><p>blance ended. Farley radiated a good na- </p><p>ture which would make allowances; White </p><p>demanded of others the machine-like effi- </p><p>ciency which characterized his own work. </p><p> “And that’s the reason you hold us up</p><p>now and then in our supplies,” he said. </p><p>“You can’t do good work with cheap tools.” </p><p>Farley’s reply was interrupted by the ar- </p><p>rival of a motor-car, the panels of w'hose </p><p>doors were emblazoned with the eagle-top- </p><p>ped shield of the Government. The two </p><p>men hurried toward it; and a certain defer- </p><p>ence in their manner told that the genial- </p><p>faced man who descended was the Govem- </p><p>or-General. </p><p> As White started to leave, the Governor</p><p>detained him with a hand on his shoulder. </p><p> I have just dropped in to pay a friendly</p><p>morning call,” he said. “Come up with us.” </p><p>The three mounted the stairs to the </p><p>offices, leaving Cropsey the only white man </p><p>on the lower floor of the long concrete </p><p>building in which the Government houses </p><p>its supplies. </p><p> He watched them go, a faint flicker of</p><p>resentment in his manner. They repre- </p><p>sented success, prosperity, an abundance of </p><p>the good things of life; he failure—a man </p><p>who was hanging to its outskirts, as it </p><p>were, by the slender thread of a five-peso-a- </p><p>day job. Take that from him today; to- </p><p>morrow he would be a beach-comber. For </p><p>while with five pesos a day a man can live </p><p>m some comfort in Manila, eating the luke- </p><p>warm chow served by Ah Sing in his dingy </p><p>restaurant and sleeping in a cane-bottomed </p><p>bed in a musty room of one of the walled </p><p>city s rambling stone houses, he can hardly </p><p>lay by enough for his hospital bills when </p><p>the inevitable sickness strikes him. </p><p> But if Cropsey’s wage had been multi-</p><p>plied tenfold he would at the end of the </p><p>month have had little more to show for it. </p><p>He was one of those men born never to </p><p>possess anything more substantial than a </p><p>roving spirit. Putting money into his pock- </p><p>ets was like pouring water into a barrel with </p><p>a hole in its bottom. </p><p> But there was something more than re-</p><p>sentment in his manner this morning. </p><p>There was a vague uneasiness, brought </p><p>about by his consciousness of having vio- </p><p>lated the rule of his Bureau which admitted </p><p>of no exceptions; and his sin was returning</p><p>to plague him. With the purpose of saving </p><p>an extra trip to the powder magazine at </p><p>San Juan, he had hidden in the building a </p><p>small box of dynamite to be shipped that </p><p>afternoon, together with some steel rods, </p><p>to the engineers at work on the Calao </p><p>bridge. The box lay in an out-of-the-way </p><p>corner, behind some bales of Manila hemp </p><p>and straw-filled packing-cases. </p><p> While White and Farley had been nosing</p><p>about the building, he had been in terror </p><p>lest they should discover his infraction, </p><p>which he knew would mean his summary </p><p>dismissal. With a sigh of relief he had </p><p>watched them mount the stairs. </p><p> Now he started for the box, intending to</p><p>get rid of it at once; but suddenly he </p><p>checked himself. The Governor-General </p><p>had gone up with them; he would be coming </p><p>down at any moment, for the Governor did </p><p>not pay protracted calls. </p><p> Cropsey scowled as he moved over to</p><p>the part of the building furthest away from </p><p>the hidden box. A dull rage burned in his </p><p>heart. He had the inefficient man’s con- </p><p>tempt of rules. He felt that he had been </p><p>trying to save the Government time ancj </p><p>money, and instead of receiving thanks for </p><p>his zeal, he was in danger of losing his place. </p><p>A man who is used to getting only rebuffs </p><p>from fortune, becomes quick to see his griev- </p><p>ances. He told himself that hereafter he </p><p>would do his work and no more, absolutely </p><p>no more. He almost wished that the box </p><p>would catch on fire and blow the building </p><p>with its occupants to Kingdom Come. </p><p> It was not in answer to Cropsey’s wish,</p><p>but because a brown longshoreman, coming </p><p>in from the pier, some forty yards from the </p><p>end of the building, had not tossed away his </p><p>lighted cigarette until after he had passed </p><p>34 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>through the opening near the hemp, that it </p><p>began to smolder and a spark slowly to </p><p>burn its way through the sacking to some </p><p>of the loose straw which had fallen from the </p><p>packing-cases. </p><p> The sound of the Governor’s voice on the</p><p>stairway caused Cropsey unconsciously to </p><p>glance over his shoulder toward the hidden </p><p>explosive. Tongues of llame were leaping </p><p>upward from the cases, which crackled as </p><p>merrily as a Christmas tire, and over the </p><p>hemp bales a cloud of smoke was forming. </p><p>FOR an instant Cropsey gazed at </p><p>the fire incredulously; and then, </p><p>without a word, he began running</p><p>through the building toward the blaze. His </p><p>only feeling was one of resentment against </p><p>the length of the unpartitioned floor. </p><p> Some one who had seen the fire at the</p><p>same moment raised the cry. Almost </p><p>abreast of Cropsey, Farley, followed by the </p><p>Governor, raced to turn the water into the </p><p>hose, while White hurried to the pier to </p><p>summon the fire-launch. </p><p> With a sudden gasp, as the hot air filled</p><p>his lungs, Cropsey hurled himself across </p><p>the smoldering hemp bales; before him lay </p><p>the deadly box; its sides were smoking. </p><p>Stooping quickly, he lifted it in his arms, </p><p>and began cautiously to make his way be- </p><p>tween the burning packing-cases. </p><p> The end of his solitary upper garment, a</p><p>loose military coat, brushing against one of </p><p>the cases, took fire. As the flame smote his </p><p>skin, he staggered; but in an instant he had </p><p>caught himself and moved forward with </p><p>jerky steps, like a mechanical toy, to the </p><p>sea now only a few paces distant. </p><p> Through his bloodshot eyes he caught</p><p>sight of White running toward him down </p><p>the roadway. </p><p> “Get back, you fool!” he shrieked in a</p><p>high, sobbing voice. </p><p> Something in his tone checked White,</p><p>whose legs, against the volition of his brain, </p><p>moved him backward. </p><p> A moment more and Cropsey felt beneath</p><p>his feet the rocks which formed the retain- </p><p>ing-wall of the sea. Down them he stag- </p><p>gered until the water came about his knees. </p><p>Then carefully laying the box in a crevice </p><p>of the rocks, he plunged head-foremost into </p><p>the sea. The awful searing of his back </p><p>ceased, but the salt water stung him cruelly. </p><p> White, hurrying forward to the man’s as-</p><p>sistance, saw as he clambered down the </p><p>rocks the box which lay harmless enough </p><p>beneath the quiet water; and his practised </p><p>eye recognized it for what it was. But he </p><p>did not pause. </p><p> “Here!” he said bending down and</p><p>stretching out one hand while the other </p><p>dung to a projecting ledge. “Take hold!” </p><p> Cropsey seized the hand and was drawn</p><p>upward. </p><p> When they reached the roadway the blaze</p><p>was out, and Filipino laborers were gingerly </p><p>rolling the still smoking hemp bales across </p><p>the concrete floor to the open air where a </p><p>barefooted too played a stream of water </p><p>upon them. </p><p> The Governor and Farley, who had seen</p><p>the incident without comprehending its</p><p>meaning, met the pair as they approached </p><p>the building. Cropsey stood facing them, </p><p>hatless, begrimed and dirty; but no one real- </p><p>ized that he had actually been on fire. </p><p> “Are you hurt?” inquired the Governor</p><p>solicitously. </p><p> The feeling of resentment welied up in</p><p>Cropsey intensified in its bitterness. His </p><p>back was a live coal, his lungs a glowing </p><p>bellows, and this man was asking him </p><p>if he was hurt. He shook his head sul- </p><p>lenly. </p><p> “Well, then, tell us why in the name of</p><p>all that is reasonable you rushed headlong </p><p>into that fire?” </p><p> To Cropsey the world had suddenly token</p><p>on the blur of a spinning top. He clenched </p><p>his hands in his effort to maintain bis foot- </p><p>ing; but still he did not answer. </p><p> “I'll tell you why,” White cut in crisply.</p><p>“To get a box of dynamite. Perhaps he will </p><p>tell us what it was doing there.” </p><p> The Governor’s ruddy cheeks paled</p><p>slightly and he drew a step nearer the fore- </p><p>man. </p><p> “You did that?” he asked, a new note of</p><p>respect in liis voice. </p><p> Cropsey made no reply. Instead, he fell</p><p>forward limply, as his legs crumpled under </p><p>him, into the Governor’s arms which auto- </p><p>matically opened to receive him. </p><p> Beneath his hands the Governor felt the</p><p>man’s bare skin. </p><p> "Get me my car quick, and here. Farley,</p><p>you help me!” he shouted; and as, a mo- </p><p>ment later, the car shot forward with the </p><p>unconscious man supported between then., </p><p>he called to White, "Telephone them I am </p><p>coming!” </p><p> As they raced through the level streets,</p><p>An Occasional Hero </p><p>35 </p><p>ihe Governor turned a puzzled look on the </p><p>man resting against his shoulder. </p><p> “Where did you get him?” he asked Far-</p><p>ley in a low voice. </p><p> And when Farley told him that the man</p><p>had come with a note from Calvin asking </p><p>that he be given work, the Governor made </p><p>no comment but his arm closed more pro- </p><p>tectingly around Cropsey. </p><p> As usual, White did his work thoroughly.</p><p>Everything was in readiness to receive and </p><p>succor the stricken man. </p><p> The Governor waited until the surgeon</p><p>had made his report, pacing noiselessly up </p><p>and down the long corridor of the men’s </p><p>private ward, his head bent as if in thought.</p><p>And if the white-capped nurses, who flitted </p><p>quietly in and out of the rooms, were sur- </p><p>prised to see the highest representative of </p><p>the United States in all the East, awaiting </p><p>news of one of her lowliest citizens, they </p><p>gave no hint of it in their manner. </p><p>FOR days Cropsey lingered in that </p><p>borderland which separates death </p><p>from life; and at first it seemed im- </p><p>possible that he should not pass across it. </p><p>But as is so often the case with those to </p><p>whom life has the least value, he clung </p><p>tenaciously to it. In the second week it be- </p><p>came evident that he would get well, al- </p><p>though he would have a long period of con- </p><p>valescence in the hospital. </p><p> It was during this period that the Gov-</p><p>ernor dropped in to see him occasionally, </p><p>making little friendly calls as a man does </p><p>on his equal. </p><p> And during this period, a change seemed</p><p>to come over Cropsey. It was as if the fire, </p><p>passing through his system, had burned out </p><p>the resentment which hitherto he had felt </p><p>toward life. And with this change he real- </p><p>ized the enormity of his offense. </p><p> Before, he had thought of the Governor-</p><p>General with a vague feeling of contempt, </p><p>as a man whom good luck had put into a </p><p>position which he, Cropsey, could have </p><p>filled much more ably had the same good </p><p>luck put him in it. Now he realized that it </p><p>was the Governor’s strength and character </p><p>which had raised him above his fellows, and </p><p>the knowledge humbled him; he felt his </p><p>own unworthiness. </p><p> He spoke of it one afternoon, haltinglv</p><p>as he sat in a wheel-chair on the balcony </p><p>outside his room, overlooking the green ter- </p><p>races studded with flowering shrubs which </p><p>surrounded the hospital, trying inadequate- </p><p>ly to find words to express his humiliation. </p><p> The Governor listened without interrup-</p><p>tion until Cropsey had finished. Then </p><p>placing his hand on the patient's knee, he </p><p>said: </p><p> “Well, whatever mistakes you made you</p><p>atoned for later. Suppose we call it quits </p><p>all around.” </p><p> And on his wray out later, he stopped at</p><p>the chief surgeon's office. </p><p> “Will Cropsey ever be good for anything</p><p>again?” he asked. </p><p> “He will get over the effects of the fire all</p><p>right, Governor,’' answered the surgeon. </p><p>“The trouble with him is he has shot his </p><p>constitution to pieces like so many of these </p><p>fellows over here. I am treating him now</p><p>for chronic maiaria. That is what he will </p><p>have to watch out for, the fever. But with </p><p>light work and good food, in a place where </p><p>he doesn’t have to tax his strength too </p><p>much, he ought to last a long time.” </p><p> The next morning Calvin was instructed</p><p>to keep his eyes open for such a billet as </p><p>the surgeon had described. </p><p> Cropsey was able, with the aid of a cane,</p><p>to w-alk about the hospital when Calvin re- </p><p>ported that he had found a place for him— </p><p>keeper of the lighthouse at Bago reef. </p><p> “Of course it is a place of great responsi-</p><p>bility, sir, for all the ships from Hongkong </p><p>and the north depend on that light,” said </p><p>the secretary. “But he would have a na- </p><p>tive assistant to do the heavy work. He </p><p>would only have to see that the light was </p><p>kept burning. Do you think you could </p><p>trust him?” </p><p> The Governor hesitated for a moment,</p><p>and then said as if thinking aloud: </p><p> “Yes, I believe we can. At any rate, I</p><p>am going to chance it.” A quizzical smile </p><p>flashed over his face, and he added, “Do </p><p>you know, I have an idea White won’t be </p><p>much pleased.”	(</p><p> “I have the same idea, sir,” Calvin</p><p>laughed. “I think you will have to settle </p><p>it with him yourself.” </p><p> “It is a very important place, Governor,"</p><p>said White quietly when the Governor men- </p><p>tioned the matter to him. </p><p> “Yes, I know’, but I believe he will meas-</p><p>ure up to it. He has received his baptism </p><p>of fire, remember.” </p><p> White lifted his level eyes to the Govern-</p><p>or’s. </p><p> “Of course, if you say put him on, I shall</p><p>Adventure </p><p>do it, liut you will make me break one rule </p><p>1 have always observed—never to hire a </p><p>man with a slouch in him.” </p><p> The Governor drew meditatively at his</p><p>cigar. </p><p> “Slouch or no slouch, the man did some-</p><p>tlung I confess I should not have had the </p><p>courage to do—run for that dynamite in- </p><p>stead of away from it.” </p><p> “But if he hadn’t put it there in the first</p><p>place, he wouldn't have had to get it out. </p><p>It took sand, I’ll admit, but it was a sort of </p><p>impulse, a flash in the pan. If it came to </p><p>an emergency, like sticking to his post if </p><p>anything happened to the light—of course </p><p>I may be doing him an injustice —but hon- </p><p>estly I don't believe he would do it. I dis- </p><p>trust these fellows who think they know it</p><p>ail and won’t live up to the rules.” </p><p>The Governor rose and held out his hand. </p><p> “You put him on; I’ll take the responsi-</p><p>bility.” </p><p> It was a part of White’s code, once he</p><p>had employed Cropsey, to treat him with </p><p>absolute fairness. He might harbor a </p><p>grudge against him personally, but he </p><p>judged his work as impartially as if the ex- </p><p>soldier had been his own selection. </p><p> And for a time the new keeper’s unfa-</p><p>miliarity with the routine of his office tried </p><p>White's patience. But he did not show it </p><p>in the long, carefully worded letters he </p><p>wrote Cropsey, minutely explaining the er- </p><p>rors in his reports and asking for their cor- </p><p>rection. </p><p> Cropsey, on his sand spit, received these</p><p>letters, several at a time when the weekly </p><p>mail-boat put in at Bago, and a barefooted </p><p>boatman in cotton drawers and a wide, </p><p>straw hat paddled out to the lighthouse </p><p>with the mail. He spent hours poring over </p><p>them, try ing to fix each detail in his mind. </p><p>But secretly they amused him. All this list- </p><p>ing of tomatoes and bacon consumed, of </p><p>gallons of oil burned, of the hours he spent </p><p>at his work seemed so unnecessary. </p><p> The thing was so simple, merely to keep</p><p>the light burning from evening until morn- </p><p>ing, at all hazards, no matter what hap- </p><p>pened, so that the steamers whose smoke </p><p>from time to time curled upward for half </p><p>an hour against the distant horizon, might </p><p>shun the reef athwart, on which, for all the </p><p>peacefulness of the blue water, lay destruc- </p><p>tion for any which might chance upon it. </p><p>And Cropsey was contented. He had </p><p>found his nichc; just to sit at the d&lt;x&gt;r of his </p><p>bungalow, sweeping the sea with his glasses </p><p>for passing ships and feeling that he was </p><p>master ol the squat tower on his left, and </p><p>so responsible for their safety, gave him a </p><p>sense of iinj&gt;ortance and of usefulness in </p><p>the world. He came to know the regular </p><p>boats and to speak of them to Fabian, his </p><p>assistant, affectionately, almost as il they </p><p>had been persons; but he did not envy those </p><p>upon them their journeyings. He had </p><p>found that the jostling of the crowd meant </p><p>the multiplication of life’s problems. </p><p> There were no white people in Bago, the</p><p>village eight miles away at the head of the </p><p>bay. Sometimes the villagers came over </p><p>to the lighthouse, and in solemn procession </p><p>climbed the winding stair to the light, where </p><p>they stood silent while Cropsey proudly ex- </p><p>plained its mechanism. The presidente, a</p><p>wrinkled little man with an olive face, who </p><p>wore gaiters with elastic in their sides and </p><p>a suit of dingy' black clothes, always came </p><p>with them. He seemed to have taken a </p><p>great fancy to Cropsey, and always begged </p><p>him to come to Bago and accept his hos- </p><p>pitality. </p><p> Cropsey had been two months at the</p><p>lighthouse before he paid his fir.-t i-it to </p><p>the village; but after that he went frequent- </p><p>ly, dining with the presidente and return- </p><p>ing to his station before sunset. For on this </p><p>point his instructions had been explicit—he </p><p>must always be at his post when the light </p><p>was burning. </p><p> It was this rule which led him to refuse</p><p>the invitation of the presidente to attend </p><p>the supper and bailc in honor of the presi- </p><p>dente’s ninth child. The little man took </p><p>the refusal to heart. </p><p> “Is it because I am a Filipino that you</p><p>don’t come, senor?” he asked. </p><p> “No, it is the light, senor presidente. I</p><p>must be here when it is burning." </p><p> “But from my house, from the bay, you</p><p>can always see the light. And Fabian will </p><p>be here to watch it.” </p><p> Anil when Cropsey still declined, the na-</p><p>tive’s shoulders drooped. </p><p> “I had hoped you would be padrino." he</p><p>said slowly. </p><p> “I will be padrino, even though I do not</p><p>come,” answered Cropsey. </p><p> But the man’s disappointment troubled</p><p>him as he returned to his house. He felt </p><p>that the native would never understand </p><p>why he declined to come; it would seem to </p><p>him almost a betrayal of his friendship. As </p><p>An Occasional Hero </p><p>37 </p><p>the presidente had said, he would always </p><p>be in sight of the lighthouse; nothing could </p><p>happen in his absence. It was not as if it </p><p>were the typhoon season when his return </p><p>might, be cut off by a storm. </p><p> The next morning he decided he would</p><p>go. It would be the only time; he would </p><p>make the presidente understand that. </p><p> As he got into his boat that evening, he</p><p>felt vaguely depressed. He regretted his </p><p>decision. He glanced upward over his </p><p>shoulder at the light, which, with the pre- </p><p>cise movements of a clock, was flashing its </p><p>warning through the gathering darkness; </p><p>and impulsively he crossed to the tower and </p><p>hastily climbed the stairs. Everything was </p><p>in order; it looked as he had seen it look a </p><p>thousand times before.</p><p> With a shamefaced laugh at his nervous-</p><p>ness, he returned to his boat and set off for </p><p>Bago. </p><p> But he did not stay long at the christen-</p><p>ing; his uneasiness came back. He was im- </p><p>patient to be again with the light which, as </p><p>he walked down to the water, lie saw flash- </p><p>ing across the bay. </p><p> THE full moon which had risen en-</p><p>jgSg abled Cropsey to see his sand spit </p><p>long before he reached it; and sud- </p><p>denly as he raised his eyes to glance again </p><p>at the lighthouse, he paused, his dripping </p><p>paddle held suspended in the air. In the </p><p>protected waters back of the reef a small </p><p>steamer rode at anchor. For a time he </p><p>could not place the ship; none stopped at </p><p>that anchorage, except—then it came to </p><p>him. The steamer was the lighthouse ten- </p><p>der Buluan, on which Inspector Morissey </p><p>traveled. He had come while the keeper </p><p>was absent from his post. </p><p> Feverishly he returned to his paddling,</p><p>ms gasps of effort drowning the gurgle of </p><p>the water as it fell away from the prow of </p><p>his boat. One hope sustained him: per- </p><p>haps the inspector had not gone ashore that </p><p>night. It was long past midnight; the </p><p>steamer might have just arrived </p><p> But as he neared his sand spit, he saw a</p><p>launch drawn up on the shore. </p><p> He finished his journey slowly. This</p><p>then, was the end. He would lose his place! </p><p>branded as untrustworthy; and with this </p><p> A u burned-°ut body, he would</p><p>not find another. No, he would drop into </p><p>that crowd of derelicts for whom even the </p><p>problem of making a Jiving had proved in- </p><p>soluble, shuffling through what remained </p><p>to him of life an outcast and a p&gt;ariah. And </p><p>the Governor would learn that he had be- </p><p>trayed his trust; he only hoped that he </p><p>would never again be called on to meet </p><p>those friendly gray eyes. </p><p> He looked down at the water. A slight</p><p>shifting of position, a moment’s struggle </p><p>and then oblivion. The ripples where the </p><p>water broke over his hand on the paddle </p><p>were soft and its warmth pleasant to the </p><p>skin. It would close over him caress- </p><p>ingly. </p><p> But something stirred in Cropsey, some</p><p>feeling, some instinct, which had caused </p><p>him that other time to run for the dynamite. </p><p>With a dogged sweep of his paddle, he drove </p><p>his batica ashore beside the launch. </p><p> Morissey was reading beside a small</p><p>wicker table, over which an unshaded lamp</p><p>threw a glaring light. He glanced up as </p><p>Cropsey entered, but although he had never </p><p>seen the keeper before, he neither rose nor </p><p>introduced himself. </p><p> “I hope you had a pleasant evening.” he</p><p>said, drawing the corners of his straight lips </p><p>down into a mocking smile. </p><p> Cropsey’s heart sank. He read no mercy</p><p>in the hard face before him. </p><p> &lt;fYou’re Inspector Morissey, I suppose, '</p><p>he replied, shuffling across the room to a </p><p>chair on the other side of the table. </p><p> “Yes. I hope my visit hasn't inconve-</p><p>nienced you.” </p><p> “My absence doesn’t seem to have incon-</p><p>venienced you much,” flared back the keep- </p><p>er, stung by the other’s insolence. </p><p> “Your absence,” returned Morissey im-</p><p>perturbably. “I was coming to that. I sup- </p><p>pose you can explain it.” </p><p> Cropsey’s anger cooled as quickly as it</p><p>had risen. </p><p> “There ain’t no excuse, if you mean busy-</p><p>ness took me. I just went over for a min- </p><p>ute to a christening at the presidente’s. I </p><p>was padrino to his baby; he seemed to think </p><p>it was unfriendly when I said I wouldn’t go. </p><p>Everything was all right. It’s a fine night, </p><p>and I could see the light even* minute I </p><p>was away.” </p><p> “Weil,” said Morissey, rising and stretch-</p><p>ing himself with a yawn, “you’ll have a </p><p>chance to put it in writing in the morning, </p><p>and I’ll give it to the chief. Maybe he can </p><p>see the connection between baptizing a baby </p><p>and running a lighthouse. I confess I </p><p>can’t.” </p><p>Adventure </p><p> He moved over to the doorway, but on</p><p>its threshold be paused. </p><p> “You might send a letter along to the</p><p>Governor-General at the same time. 1 un- </p><p>derstand he is a Iriend of yours.” There </p><p>was open mockery in his tone. </p><p> Cropsey sprang to his feet and rushed to-</p><p>ward the inspector, his eyes blazing. </p><p> “You leave the Governor out of this. Do</p><p>you hear? I ain't asking favors. 1 guess I </p><p>can take my medicine—you just leave him </p><p>out!” </p><p> Morissey stepped backward before this</p><p>unexpected outburst. For a moment he </p><p>stared at Cropsey incredulously. </p><p> “Do you mean you are not going to put</p><p>up a whine to the Governor?” he asked in </p><p>a changed tone. </p><p> "Yes. What’s he got to do with it?”</p><p> Without replying, Morissey paced two or</p><p>three times up and down the room, his </p><p>hands clasped behind him, his head bent </p><p>in thought. Now and then he shot a curi- </p><p>ous look at Cropsey who was leaning against </p><p>the door-jamb. his glance resting on the </p><p>floor. At length he approached the keeper. </p><p> “Xook here,” he said, “I shall have to re-</p><p>port your absence, but I wili tell White it </p><p>was the first time—I talked with Fabian </p><p>before you came—and everything seems to </p><p>be in capital shape. I will mention that, too. </p><p>You write out whatever you want to say. </p><p>Make it as strong as you can.” Hie hesi- </p><p>tated as he saw the look in Cropsey’s eyes. </p><p>“Don’t count too much on it. White is </p><p>strong for keeping on the job. Maybe~he </p><p>will let you off this time, but frankly I </p><p>doubt it. Good night!" </p><p> Cropsey limply shook the outstretched</p><p>hand, and without comment dragged his </p><p>tired body to the lighthouse. The staccato </p><p>explosions of the engine in Morissey's </p><p>launch sounded like pistol-shots in his brain, </p><p>as he sank wearily on the steps. </p><p>TWO weeks later Morissey finished </p><p>his cruise and reported to White in </p><p>Manila. </p><p> “That’s a queer specimen you have down</p><p>there,” he said, as White looked up from the </p><p>papers in Cropsey’s case. “He ought to </p><p>have whined, but he didn’t; and when I </p><p>taunted him with his pull with the Gov- </p><p>ernor, he nearly murdered me. If you fire </p><p>him, honestly, I don’t believe he will put up </p><p>a howl.” </p><p> White laid the papers carefully on the</p><p>table and swung his chair around, so that </p><p>through the open window his glance rested </p><p>on the blue waters of the ba&gt; and the dis- </p><p>tant slope of Mariveles rising behind them. </p><p>Morissey’s report had caused him a dis- </p><p>tinct feeling of regret. </p><p> In the months that Cropsey had been at</p><p>Bago, White’s feeling toward him had </p><p>changed. It had gradually been borne in </p><p>upon him that the keeper was taking pride </p><p>in his work and was honestly trying to carry </p><p>out his duties; and if a man is sincere in his </p><p>work, the work is apt to take care of itself. </p><p>The irregularities in his reports had grown </p><p>less and less frequent. White had come to </p><p>feel that Bago was no longer one of his prob- </p><p>lems. To dismiss Cropsey would be- to open </p><p>it again. </p><p> But the invariable punishment for ab-</p><p>sence from duty was dismissal. He told </p><p>himself he would have to let the keeper go, </p><p>but he also told himself there was no hurry</p><p>—the matter could rest until tomorrow. </p><p>He turned briskly and rose from his </p><p>chair. </p><p> “Come on,” he said, “let’s go up to the</p><p>club and have a bile of lunch. There are- </p><p>one or two points I want to clear up before </p><p>I take action.-’ </p><p> “I don’t think he would do it again.'' said</p><p>the inspector, stretching himself lazily. </p><p> “Oh, I suppose we will have to let him</p><p>out,” White answered indifferently, as they </p><p>started for the door. </p><p> Morissey smiled, but made no comment.</p><p> The papers were still hang on White’s</p><p>desk when the* inspector entered the next </p><p>morning. </p><p> “Do you know,” said the chief, ”1 have</p><p>been trying to find a man for that Bago </p><p>place, and to save my soul I can't think of </p><p>one I would be willing to trust with it. </p><p>Confound that fellow! He has put us in a </p><p>hole.” </p><p> “Why not let Cropsey stay on for a</p><p>time?” ventured Morissey, turning to the </p><p>window to conceal his grin. </p><p> White tapped the edge of his desk with a</p><p>pencil. </p><p> “But that—” The strident noise of his</p><p>telephone-bell interrupted him. “Yes, this </p><p>is White!” </p><p> Morissey, watching the face of his chief,</p><p>knew from its growing tenseness that he was </p><p>receiving news of importance. He caught </p><p>the words, “Bago—Cropsey—cholera, you </p><p>say! Yes, I’ll go at once! Thank you.” </p><p>An Occasional Hero </p><p>39 </p><p> White snapped the receiver on its hook</p><p>and sprang to his feet. </p><p> “Can the Buluan put to sea in an hour,</p><p>Bob?" he asked. </p><p> “Yes, something the matter with Crop-</p><p>sey?” </p><p> “I don’t know. That was the Executive</p><p>Secretary. He had a wire from the presi- </p><p>dente at Bago. Said they have had cholera </p><p>at the lighthouse, and Cropsey needs help. </p><p>The message wasn’t very dear. I’ll get a </p><p>doctor and meet you on board at noon.” </p><p> The one thing which unfailingly strikes</p><p>terror to the heart of the white man in the </p><p>Philippines is Asiatic cholera. Its loath- </p><p>someness, the suddenness with which it </p><p>strikes its victims, the flame-like rapidity </p><p>with which it spreads, give it an air of mys- </p><p>teriousness which adds to its horror. What </p><p>he eats, the very air he breathes seem </p><p>charged with a subtle menace.</p><p> WHEN Cropsey, ten days after</p><p>Morissey’s departure, entered the </p><p>nipa house on the other side of the </p><p>tower, in which Fabian lived with his wife </p><p>and two children, he had expected to find </p><p>one of them ailing of a mild complaint. Fa- </p><p>bian had said merely that the nino was sick, </p><p>when he requested Cropsey to come. </p><p> But a glance at the gasping child and</p><p>Cropsey had recognized the malady of </p><p>which he had seen strong men die over- </p><p>night. It had cholera. </p><p> The mother, round-eyed and passive,</p><p>squatted on the floor behind the low bed. </p><p>Behind her, beside a half-emptied rice-pot, </p><p>stood the other child, its little stomach pro- </p><p>truding like an inflated balloon from its </p><p>short white shirt. It had eaten from the </p><p>same vessel as its brother. Fabian enter- </p><p>ing after Cropsey, had paused near the door. </p><p> The eyes of all were fixed on the white</p><p>man. In their trouble they had instinctively </p><p>turned to him for assistance. </p><p> Cropsey gave some hurried instructions</p><p>to the woman—in his heart he realized their </p><p>inadequacy—and then, turning away, he </p><p>beckoned to Fabian, who followed him </p><p>across the sand spit to his bungalow. Here </p><p>Cropsey wrote a hurried letter to White </p><p>telling him of the cholera and suggesting </p><p>that he send a man to Bago to take charge </p><p>of the light, in case his services should be </p><p>needed. </p><p>hC S5id t0 Fabian&gt; “you take </p><p>this lo Bago and post it. Then you come </p><p>back with Gonzales, the mcdico, quick. </p><p>But be sure to post the letter—there’s a </p><p>boat tomorrow. And ask the presidente to </p><p>come back with you; he can send a man to </p><p>Taypay with a telegram.” </p><p> The resentfulness, which since Morissey’s</p><p>visit Cropsey’s face had worn, was gone. </p><p>In the depths of his eyes one might have </p><p>seen a vague look of terror; but his step, as </p><p>he again entered Fabian’s house, was reso- </p><p>lute. </p><p> Fabian reached Bago as night was falling</p><p>—in the bottom of the banca which a fish- </p><p>ing-boat had picked up as it drifted aim- </p><p>lessly about the bay; and Cropsey’s letter </p><p>was in the pocket of his camisa when they </p><p>buried him the next morning, without wait- </p><p>ing for the presidente to return from a few </p><p>days' visit to Taypay. </p><p> At about the same hour Cropsey and the</p><p>woman were spading two narrow graves in </p><p>the sand back of the lighthouse. </p><p> Through his glasses later he watched the</p><p>mail-boat depart for Manila. In a week, </p><p>he told himself, she would return with a </p><p>man to relieve him, and he could get away. </p><p>He would not wait for his dismissal. He </p><p>was weary. He stretched his hand against </p><p>a post to support himself, as a slight dizzi- </p><p>ness shook him. </p><p> He was alone when the mail-boat re-</p><p>turned. He had difficulty in making out </p><p>her lines. His sight was becoming blurred; </p><p>he had to blink before he looked at objects. </p><p>Three days and nights he had watched be- </p><p>side the woman, stealing away only to at- </p><p>tend the light, and to snatch such food as </p><p>he could find fit to eat without cooking. </p><p>And then—of her house he had made her </p><p>funeral pyre. </p><p> With the woman gone, his duties had</p><p>become less exacting; but he found them </p><p>more difficult to perform. The walk be- </p><p>tween his bungalow and the tower became </p><p>a journey, which at last he ceased to make/ </p><p>living in the lighthouse and saving his </p><p>strength for the torturing climb of the </p><p>stairs. </p><p> He had long since ceased to wonder why</p><p>Fabian had not come back with the presi- </p><p>dente. Only one idea filled his mind—to </p><p>keep the light burning until the white ship </p><p>coming from the south turned in at Bago </p><p>Bay. </p><p> Now that white ship was here. He</p><p>watched her cut her way leisurely through </p><p>the blue-gray waters to the distant village; </p><p>40 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and then for hours he waited for the bout </p><p>which would bring liis relief. </p><p> When ut lust he realized that none was</p><p>coming, he gave a mirthless laugh and sank </p><p>down in the doorway of the tower, his head </p><p>resting on its sill. They expected him to </p><p>do the job alone; they refused to help him. </p><p> Here the presidente found him. He</p><p>could make little of Cropsey's mutterings. </p><p>He shook his head when he saw the burned </p><p>house. There was an air of desolation about </p><p>the place. </p><p> He took the keeper by the arm.</p><p> “Come with me, sefior,” he said.</p><p> But Cropsey shook him olT with feeble</p><p>curses, raving incoherently something about </p><p>“being no quitter.” </p><p> When the Butuan, under forced draft,</p><p>rounded the point to the south, the sun was </p><p>shining brightly; and White and Morissey, </p><p>standing on the bridge, eagerly focussed </p><p>their glasses on the lighthouse.</p><p>Presently an exclamation broke from </p><p>Morissey. </p><p> “My God! The light’s flashing!”</p><p> The presidente met them on the beach.</p><p> “The door is locked, sefior,” he said, “and</p><p> all day yesterday the light burned.”</p><p> White forced the door and ran hurriedly</p><p> up the stairs; but something by the light</p><p> drove him back.</p><p> As he passed to the fresh air outside, he</p><p> met the doctor.</p><p> “I don't think you will be needed,” he</p><p> said.</p><p> Two hundred yards out across the rip-</p><p> pling water, the iButuan rode at anchor.</p><p> From her stem, snapping in the brisk</p><p> breeze, flew the flag of his country.</p><p> For a full minute White gazed at it fixed-</p><p> ly. Then, turning, he raised his glance to</p><p> the light; and suddenly lifting his hat, he</p><p> placed it against his breast, and bowed his</p><p> head reverently.</p><p>HAPyD ROCK </p><p>Juliuj* </p><p>Grinnell </p><p>Furtfimann </p><p>T WAS at Sixtv-Mile, on the </p><p>edge of the Mojave, where the </p><p>mountains met the desert; where </p><p>Grant Brothers &amp; McCann were </p><p>pushing a hard-rock grade toward Reno for </p><p>the California &amp; Nevada Southwestern; </p><p>where the sun was dropping down behind </p><p>H </p><p>the hills, and the light it cast becoming </p><p>softened and romantic; where, of a sudden, </p><p>the great peaks shook. </p><p>Boom! </p><p> There was no wind; only this low, sullen</p><p> roar came back over the hills.</p><p>Boom-mt </p><p>Hard Rock </p><p>41 </p><p> They were firing the evening round. Out</p><p>on the grade, down in the tunnels, dyna- </p><p>mite was finishing the day’s work. Shot </p><p>succeeded shot; the mountains flung back </p><p>the echoes; the earth seemed to reel under </p><p>the measured crash on crash. It was as if </p><p>several batteries of big guns had suddenly </p><p>gone into action. </p><p> In the deathly quiet that fell with the</p><p>last of it, two men slowly mounted the rocky </p><p>path that chipped its way up the steep w'all </p><p>of the canon leading into the far side of </p><p>camp. They were an oddly assorted pair. </p><p>One was a squat, burly little man in cordu- </p><p>roys, with a chest like a gorilla, extraordi-</p><p>narily long arms and a pug nose. The other </p><p>was rather tall, of lank bulk every way; a </p><p>young giant with short red hair, eyes packed </p><p>away under heavy brows, and a great clean- </p><p>shaven jaw that always looked cheerfully </p><p>grim. </p><p> A stiff climb brought them to the path</p><p>which, swinging around a bend, led to the </p><p>little yellow commissary shack, and beyond </p><p>that to the long, low-built wTooden structure, </p><p>hereafter known as the cook-house. </p><p> “Ha,” said the little man, stopping</p><p>short. </p><p> The other swung his head.</p><p> “What’s the matter?”</p><p> “Look who’s come to camp!”</p><p> A chuck-wagon had just pulled up in</p><p>front of the commissar}'. The speaker indi- </p><p>cated a big young man, taking his ease on </p><p>the seat. The driver had jumped down and </p><p>disappeared in the litde company store. </p><p> The red-headed young man laughed, a</p><p>hard, soundless laugh, through closed lips. </p><p> ‘ Gunner Gallegher!” he said in a low</p><p>voice. </p><p> At this moment the other looked up and</p><p>saw them. He did not move, but just sat </p><p>there looking down at them, his dark face </p><p>lighting up with the grim, inquisitive ex- </p><p>pression that is so near smiling and vet so </p><p>different in effect. </p><p> They walked over.</p><p> “Hello, Gunner,” said the red-headed</p><p>young man. </p><p> Gallegher nodded.</p><p> Hi, Bonfire, said he, then jerked his</p><p>head toward the other’s companion. “W'ho’s </p><p>your friend?” </p><p> Burns. Tom Burns. You remember</p><p>him from the North Bank, don’t you?” </p><p> “Oh, yes. He had the timber ganc; that’s</p><p>right. Hi, Burns.” </p><p> “Hello, Gallegher,” the little timberman</p><p>nodded back. “How’s everything?” </p><p> “Pretty good. Made a short stake in the</p><p>D.	&amp; R. G. tunnels out of Grand Junction.</p><p>How’s tricks, Bonfire?” added Gallegher, </p><p>turning to the other. </p><p> “Fair enough.” said Bonfire. “I'm day</p><p>shifter over in South Thirty-Five.” </p><p>“What’s the pay?” </p><p> “Four dollars and cakes.”</p><p> To the initiate the foregoing meant that</p><p>Bonfire was day foreman in the tunnel </p><p>knowm as South Thirty-Five and that his </p><p>wages were four dollars a day and board. </p><p> “Humph; that’s not so bad,” observed</p><p>Gallegher half to himself.</p><p> “Oh, I don’t know. But jobs are scarce</p><p>in this man’s camp,” muttered Bonfire. “I </p><p>tell you, Gunner, they ain’t hiring a soul </p><p>these days. New orders or something from </p><p>Los.” </p><p> “That’s what they told me down at the</p><p>siding,” Gallegher nodded. “But I'd heard </p><p>that you’d come up this way, Bonfire, so I </p><p>jacked up and came on.” </p><p> “W'ell, I been looking for you,’’ said Bon-</p><p>fire. “I been looking for you to show up lor </p><p>the last two weeks; I have, for a fact, Gun- </p><p>ner. Got kind of restless, too, like; so any </p><p>time you’re ready now, there's a nice piece </p><p>of ground up there back of the bunkhouse. </p><p>Howr d’you feel?” </p><p> For reply Gallegher jumped down from</p><p>the wagon-seat. He stood there, stretching </p><p>his long arms and showing the depth and </p><p>breadth of his big chest. </p><p> “I feel fine,” said he. “Why?”</p><p> “I was just wondering. Thought you</p><p>might be a little tired with your ride or </p><p>something. Two days on that desert road </p><p>ain’t no fun. I know what it is myself,” </p><p>nodded Bonfire. “We could wait till to- </p><p>morrow, you know.”	.</p><p>Gallegher shook his head. </p><p> “Not for me. How about yourself?” he</p><p>added a little anxiously. </p><p> “Oh. I'm all right. Put in a pretty big</p><p>day underground; but I guess I’m good for </p><p>a half hour of your fastest.” </p><p> “It won’t take that long,” said Gunner</p><p>Gallegher. </p><p> The other gave him a bleak stare.</p><p> “What d’you mean?” he muttered, ad-</p><p>vancing a step. </p><p> Gallegher faced him with a grin.</p><p>“Nothing,” said he, and let his long arms </p><p>swing free. </p><p>Adventure </p><p> At this juncture the little timberman</p><p>Burns stepped up, breaking a long, rather </p><p>diffident, silence. </p><p> “Say, I don’t want to be offensive,” he</p><p>began, “but what’s the row?" </p><p> Gallegher turned his head.</p><p> “Nothing much,” he said quietly. “Me</p><p>and him’s got some unfinished business, </p><p>that’s all. I thought you’d heard about it </p><p>Burns. Why, less than three months ago </p><p>Bonfire blew into Shoshone Gap and took </p><p>me to the worst licking I ever had in my </p><p>life-” </p><p> The little timberman nodded.</p><p> “I remember now,” he said, grinning.</p><p>“You had a job, and he fought you for it.</p><p>Some of the boys were talking about it the </p><p>other night. It ain't the first time either, </p><p>is it?” </p><p> “What?”</p><p> “That you two have pulled this stunt?”</p><p>“Not by half. Been at it nearly two </p><p>years now, off and on. But we ain’t the </p><p>only ones that do it. I know lots of lads </p><p>who won't go to work any other way. It’s </p><p>an old game among short-stake men; and a </p><p>good game, too, when two lads are feeling </p><p>their silk and jobs are few and far between. </p><p>It’s been turn-and-turn-about with Bonfire </p><p>and me so far. The last time he beat me </p><p>and beat me good; beat me out of bunk and </p><p>bindle and job. That’s the hard-rock game. </p><p>Winner take all, eh, Bonfire?” </p><p> The latter was unbuttoning his corduroy</p><p>jacket. </p><p> “Something like that/’ he answered,</p><p>pulling it off. </p><p> The little timberman Bums chuckled and</p><p>grinned, casting’ an appraising glance from </p><p>one to the other of the two big young men. </p><p> “Well,” he said in a minute, “I wouldn’t</p><p>bet a nickel either way myself.” </p><p> Five minutes later, stripped to the waist,</p><p>Gunner Gallegher and Bonfire stood facing </p><p>each other in a ring of shouting men. Plenty </p><p>of daylight lingered; the purple mountain </p><p>leaned against the vermillion sky; and in </p><p>the blue, an immense height above, lolled </p><p>an eagle, lazy of wing, in lordly indolence. </p><p>The crowd stood twenty deep; a typical </p><p>hard-rock crew—tall, barbaric-looking men </p><p>in khaki and corduroy, careless of speech </p><p>and gay at heart. </p><p> “Now, Gunner.”</p><p> “Go in, Bonfire.”</p><p> “I saw the Shoshone scrap.”</p><p> “They fought two hours.”</p><p> THE two men were well matched.</p><p>One was as tall as the other, and as </p><p>broad; and it would have been hard </p><p>to say, if there was any advantage in weight, </p><p>just where it fell. The two men sparred </p><p>warily, moving after each other with the </p><p>quiet ease of two huge cats. There is a cer- </p><p>tain beauty in strength, and then there is a </p><p>certain ugliness; but that usually comes </p><p>with age. These two men were beautifully </p><p>young and strong, and their lithe white </p><p>nakedness gleamed in the twilight. </p><p> “Time!” roared the men.</p><p> “No hurry,” muttered Bonfire, and</p><p>snapped in a light lead. It was a flashing </p><p>dart of wrist and mitt, and the Gunner’s </p><p>lip streamed red as he recovered with a rush</p><p>and a shower of sledge-hammer blows. </p><p> First blood set the crowd to yelling.</p><p> Bonfire ducked gamely. He had all he</p><p>could do to save his head. There was no </p><p>evading that avalanche of big-bodied bone </p><p>and muscle. He stood his ground and took </p><p>and gave smash for smash, though the play </p><p>was not up to his fancy; for the Gunn- r's </p><p>long game was to give and take. Bonfire’s </p><p>to hit and get away; but there was no help </p><p>for it now. He caught Gallegher in lull </p><p>dash, and, playing for the body, drove home </p><p>his left and right with a force that jerked </p><p>forth a grunt with each blow. </p><p> Gallegher halted, grinning for more; and</p><p>Bonfire stepped into a full swing that gave </p><p>him a taste of his own salt blood; he sab- </p><p>red, and the rue. For another savage swing </p><p>beat down his guard, and as he dived in for </p><p>a hanging clinch to save himself, his jaw </p><p>came full on the peak of a sidelong uppercut </p><p>which started at the Gunner’s right hip, </p><p>the big fist traveling less than six inches, the </p><p>shoulder nine. </p><p> It was a terrific bunt. Bonfire found him-</p><p>self on his knees watching a gay fanfare of </p><p>lightning crazily filming his brain. Blood </p><p>trickled from liis nose and ears. He saw the </p><p>Gunner dragging himself on all fours out </p><p>of the hurly-burly of the yelling mob. For </p><p>the body-English of the blow had carried </p><p>him headlong over his man. Then, reeling </p><p>to their feet, the two men went at it again. </p><p> Back and forth they footed it, struggling</p><p>for holds. Twice Bonfire tore loose and, </p><p>staggering the Gunner with a straight right </p><p>and left, he clinched again. To and fro </p><p>they clipped once more, with the crowd roar- </p><p>ing for a break; but the two men paid no </p><p>heed, and in the wrestling Gallegher began </p><p>Hard Rock </p><p>43 </p><p>to show who was the stronger man. Again </p><p>and again he beat Bonfire to his knees, using </p><p>ihe sheer weight of body and fist. It was </p><p>terrible punishment; yet there must have </p><p>been something of the Antaeus in the man, </p><p>for with each fall Bonfire seemed to gain </p><p>fresh wind and new heart for the fray. </p><p> He began to come back to something like</p><p>his old snap-shot form. He began to fight </p><p>with his head and feet as well as his hands. </p><p>Up to now he had given way and been </p><p>clubbed down. The Gunner still rushed </p><p>him fiercely, wildly; but now Bonfire moved </p><p>like a wind-driven shadow, hitting hard and </p><p>fast at ever}' turn. He gave his adversary </p><p>respect withal, cutting and slashing at long</p><p>range, until the rushes began to fall short, </p><p>grow more unsteady, more wild, which must </p><p>be expected if you don’t get your man; and </p><p>then, taking his time, Bonfire began to cut </p><p>the Gunner to pieces. </p><p> Thus the tide turned, and at last Galle-</p><p>gher halted, blinded, gasping. He spat, and </p><p>a tooth lay on the ground. He stood still, </p><p>glowering like a stricken bull; his breath </p><p>came in great sobs; blow by blow, he was </p><p>being worn down to the quick; then, on the </p><p>verge of his stubborn relapse, surprisingly, </p><p>as if drawing on the last ounce of his reserve </p><p>energy, the Gunner made a snarling rush, </p><p>slugging out with both fists. </p><p> Bonfire side-stepped neatly, parading</p><p>some pretty foot-work. He ducked under a </p><p>full right-swing, and driving left and right </p><p>to the ribs, got away. Gallegher reeled </p><p>under the savage impact, but turned and </p><p>came back gamely; he rocked a little as he </p><p>stood opposite his man, and his arms </p><p>drooped as if he felt his fists to be an unut- </p><p>terable weight. His face showed terrible </p><p>punishment. Every breath he drew seemed </p><p>a great actuality. The man was smashed, </p><p>all in at last. </p><p> finish him!'’ bellowed the crowd.</p><p> It was the beginning of the end, and the</p><p>mob was not to be denied. Bonfire smiled. </p><p>His eyes were quiet, even pensive; but his </p><p>face was terrible livid with the strange, </p><p>almost unearthly russet pallor that follows </p><p>the stormy pageant of red-headed men like </p><p>a curse of God. A sudden hush fell on the </p><p>crowd, which had drawn back a little, so </p><p>the two men in the middle might have </p><p>plenty room to make an end. </p><p> Bonfire took his time. The Gunner</p><p>looked all in, and all that; but Bonfire knew </p><p>his man. He had beaten him before, he </p><p>had him beaten now; but Bonfire was not </p><p>going to take any chances. Hard rock is </p><p>hard rock. You may pierce it with sharp </p><p>steel and break it with dynamite, but you </p><p>can’t kill it. It is smashed; at the same </p><p>time it lives, ready to strike back. There </p><p>are men like that. They work in hard rock. </p><p> Bonfire made no mistake. He crept</p><p>around the motionless figure in the middle </p><p>of the ring; he stalked it deliberately, coolly, </p><p>confidently, like a big cat waiting for the </p><p>moment to spring. One punch, just one, </p><p>that was all he wanted. </p><p> Suddenly he sprang in. Whatever was</p><p>passing in the Gunner’s mind at this mo- </p><p>ment is not knowm, but he seemed barely </p><p>able to raise his hands to meet the other’s</p><p>rush. He attempted a right swing, which </p><p>Bonfire dropped his guard to sweep aside. </p><p> Then something happened which can not</p><p>be explained. For, with his foeman once </p><p>more within easy reach, weariness seemed </p><p>to fall from Gallegher's shoulders like a </p><p>blanket; he grinned with awful expression, </p><p>and the rest was sharp work, grim and </p><p>swift and terrible. His right swing was only </p><p>a feint; now he sank it like a flash, and as he </p><p>followed through with a quick, curious </p><p>shifting of his feet, his left fist shot in over </p><p>Bonfire’s lowered guard. It struck di- </p><p>rectly over the heart—a two hundred and </p><p>ten pound jolt—and Bonfire straightened </p><p>up slowly, then fell forward like a stricken </p><p>tree, face dowrn in the soft white dust. </p><p> It wras the end. Gallegher knew it; so</p><p>did the crowd, by its silence. It was a full </p><p>minute perhaps before the prostrate figure </p><p>stirred; then, surprisingly, the man rolled </p><p>over on his back and sat up, raising himself </p><p>slowly upon his outspread arms. He looked </p><p>around stupidly. </p><p> Gallegher broke the silence.</p><p> “Had enough?” he asked, standing over</p><p>his man; Bonfire looked up, wetting hi.' </p><p>lips. </p><p> “No,” he said in a minute. “No, I ain't</p><p>done yet!” And he tried to get up on his </p><p>feet. </p><p> He fell back on one knee, and then sud-</p><p>denly made it after a fashion, rocking and </p><p>swaying in front of the Gunner like a </p><p>drunken man. </p><p> “Good boy,” said somebody in the crowd.</p><p> Bonfire staggered out and around the</p><p>Gunner. He tried to lift his hands, but </p><p>could not. </p><p> *‘Come on,” he said thickly.</p><p>44 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Gallegher hesitated no longer. He ad-</p><p> vanced a step, his list rising at his side.</p><p> Another blow would finish it; but the Gun-</p><p> ner paused in full stride, his arm poising in</p><p> mid-swing.</p><p> “WAIT a minute!”</p><p> A burly figure barred his way.</p><p> It all happened in the tick of the</p><p> clock. The newcomer held up his hand. He</p><p> was a powerful, wide-girthed fellow with a</p><p> heavy, brutal face and a scowling brow,</p><p> which, as his grin faded, matched a hard-</p><p> set mouth. A respectful commotion rose</p><p> at his back.</p><p> “What’s the matter with you boys?” he</p><p> growled.</p><p> Bonfire reeled weakly at his elbow.</p><p> “Get out of my way!” roared the Gunner.</p><p> The other laughed in his face. Pie spoke</p><p> with authority.</p><p> “Wait a minute, there. What d’you</p><p> want to do—kill the man?”</p><p> Gallegher breathed in once, hard.</p><p> “I would,” he said, and once more Bon-</p><p> fire staggered out.</p><p> “Come on, Gunner,” he begged. “I ain’t</p><p> done yet-”</p><p> The newcomer shouldered him off.</p><p> “There won't be any more scrapping to-</p><p> night,” he said, as if that settled it.</p><p> A low murmur bespoke the displeasure of</p><p> the crowd.</p><p> As for the Gunner, he drew a whistling</p><p> breath and batted an eye at Bonfire, and a</p><p> strange thing happened. Both men turned</p><p> and made for the other man, their arms</p><p> swinging loose, murderously, like those in a</p><p> common cause. The other stood his ground;</p><p> he laughed, and at the sound Bonfire</p><p> stopped and shook himself dazedly.</p><p> “Wait a second,” he said, catching the</p><p> Gunner’s arm, “it’s Jeff Call, the Walker!”</p><p> “You’re a fine rock foreman!” sneered</p><p> the walking-boss. “You’re a fine guy, you</p><p> are! Who’s going to hole South Thirty-</p><p> Five if you get put out?”</p><p> The question had at once the physical</p><p> effect of oil and a barb. There was a low</p><p> murmur of assent from the crowd. Bonfire</p><p> winced.</p><p> “What arc y’ou butting in for?”</p><p> The walking-boss met the parry with a'</p><p> curse.</p><p> “What am I butting in for? Well, you</p><p> can bet all your old shoes it wasn’t because</p><p> I was worrying about your hide! I’ll tell</p><p>you why—I ain’t taking any chances. If </p><p>South Thirty-Five is holed tomorrow ii </p><p>means a two thousand dollar bonus for the </p><p>camp. Ain t that what we been working </p><p>for day and night for the last month?” </p><p> The crowd was impressed.</p><p> “That’s so,” muttered a few.</p><p> The walking-boss saw his advantage and</p><p>pursued it. </p><p> “Listen, boys. See if I ain’t right!</p><p>South Thirty-Five is in three thousand and </p><p>four feet. The engineers told me this morn- </p><p>ing that the work in North Thirty-Five— </p><p>on the other side of the hill—was only </p><p>twenty-six foot away. Our grade and </p><p>theirs is the like, and I’ve stopped their </p><p>side of the work. Too dangerous. The day- </p><p>shot broke an even nine foot in the tunnel.</p><p>1 figure on the night shift doing the same, </p><p>so with a little luck, Bonfire ought to hole </p><p>her out tomorrow and grab the bonus!” </p><p> Bonfire smiled a wan smile.</p><p> “Oh, I’ll hole her all right,” he said</p><p>proudly. </p><p> Instantly the walking-boss clinched his</p><p>argument. </p><p> “Then what’s the use of taking any</p><p>chances? Bonfire knows the old girl like </p><p>a book. If he gets licked today the Gunner </p><p>gets his job. He may be a good man—I </p><p>know he is—but we’ve got to think about </p><p>our bonus. If they want to fight it out </p><p>again let them wait till the shift comes off </p><p>tomorrow afternoon. It’s all the same lo </p><p>me then; what I'm thinking about is the </p><p>bonus. The camp wants the money and </p><p>the record. The Gunner can take a ma- </p><p>chine under Bonfire if he likes and share </p><p>with the rest. WTiat d’you say?’’ </p><p> The crowd was with him to a man.</p><p> “Fair enough,” said Bonfire.</p><p> The Gunner gave a short- nod.</p><p> “But say, Jeff Call,” he addressed the</p><p>walking-boss, “since you’re such a good </p><p>hand at fixing things, maybe you’d like to </p><p>try a little of the same?” </p><p> “What d’you mean?”</p><p> “You know what I mean—when Bonfire</p><p>and I get through. Winner take all,” said </p><p>the Gunner, looking sly, “bunk, and bindle, </p><p>and job.” </p><p> Some of the men laughed. The walking-</p><p>boss gave a surprised curse, then scowled </p><p>thoughtfully. </p><p> “I don’t know, Gunner. I’ll have to see.</p><p>You and Bonfire better go and have a wash </p><p>before supper. I like your nerve; I may give </p><p>Hard Rock </p><p>45 </p><p>you a chance if you put Bonfire away. I </p><p>ain’t had a good scrap since that set-to with </p><p>Red Cobleigh up on the North Bank— </p><p>nearly two years ago. I'll see, Gunner; I’ll </p><p>see about it.” </p><p> ‘“No hurry, Jeff,” said the Gunner, look-</p><p>ing at his knuckles. </p><p> Bonfire touched his arm.</p><p> “Come on, Gunner,” he said. “Let’s go</p><p>and wash up.” </p><p> Late that night the shift struck springs</p><p>in the heading, so when Bonfire and the day </p><p>shift came on the next morning the delayed </p><p>shot was just being pulled. The denota- </p><p>tions cracked forth from the portal of the </p><p>tunnel with a certain deliberation, as from </p><p>the mouth of a big gun.</p><p> The men of the night shift looked hag-</p><p>gard and wan from their long vigil at the </p><p>machines. </p><p>gfflJS BONFIRE saw that the air-pumps </p><p>IhmJ were set to wrork, then entered the </p><p>tunnel. The Gunner followed him </p><p>without a w^ord. Each carried a flaring stub </p><p>of candle. Halfway in, creeping foot-high </p><p>along the narrow muck-car track, an acrid </p><p>yellow smoke met them; the ghost of the </p><p>blast. They pressed on, coughing as this </p><p>sub-floor of gas and smoke grew thick, wall- </p><p>like, reducing the yellow flame of the can- </p><p>dles to mere spots in the murk. </p><p> In the heading, however, they found the</p><p>air clean and sweet, made so by the suck </p><p>and drive of the two great tin air-pipes </p><p>which hung against the left wall of the long </p><p>drift. It sounded like a giant coughing and </p><p>gagging. </p><p> A huge pile of broken stone, the product</p><p>of the shot, confronted them, and back of it, </p><p>gleaming, sheer, blank, rose the clean white </p><p>breast of living rock. The two rockmen </p><p>crouched on the towering pile, inspecting </p><p>the grim work of steel, giant powder and </p><p>flame. </p><p> “Fine white muck,” said Bonfire, sifting</p><p>some. “Clean and dry as a wisp. No more </p><p>water, glory be!” </p><p> L hen the men came in. Bonfire told</p><p>them that a scant nine feet of white lime- </p><p>stone lay between them and the big bonus. </p><p>He drove the shovelers at the great pile of </p><p>broken rock. They caught something of his </p><p>own virile impatience. By and by, hauled </p><p>by the little electric motor-engine, car after </p><p>car of muck shot out to the dump. Even </p><p>the Gunner condescended to put a hand to </p><p>a shovel and speedily cleared a place against </p><p>the breast of rock to set his big air-drill. </p><p> Then a muck-car loaded with sharp steel</p><p>drills rolled into the heading. The nipper </p><p>boy stood them in the rack and presently </p><p>the narrow drift was filled with the brazen </p><p>song and scream of steel biting into hard </p><p>rock. </p><p> Candles stuck in broken ledges of the</p><p>passage threw an unearthly yellow glare </p><p>over all. </p><p> The drills were changed every three min-</p><p>utes. Within two hours the muck pile was </p><p>a slender heap. Bonfire stood at the naked </p><p>backs of his men, contentedly drinking in </p><p>the din. The Gunner worked like a demon. </p><p>He arrayed himself with steel and air which </p><p>screamed and hissed and sang against the </p><p>ugly face of the stubborn rock. Bonfire</p><p>patted his streaming shoulder approvingly. </p><p>The Gunner was setting a terrific pace for </p><p>the rest of the men. </p><p> “Don’t wear yourself out, Gunner,” ad-</p><p>vised Bonfire, with a grin. “Remember </p><p>you’ve got a little unfinished business for </p><p>this afternoon.’’ </p><p> “I’m remembering,” returned the Gun-</p><p>ner grimly. He grinned, but there was a </p><p>keen, half-cruel look about the tight lips </p><p>and impatient eyes. </p><p> At three o’clock the roimd was set down</p><p>and load *d. It consisted of fourteen holes </p><p>loaded with about three or four hundred </p><p>pounds of dynamite. Each hole was capped </p><p>with a primer and a fuse. Ten of the holes </p><p>were three inches in diameter and eight </p><p>feet deep in the rock. The four remaining </p><p>holes were four inches in diameter and sis </p><p>feet deep. </p><p> These last four were bored diagonally into</p><p>the rock about two feet above the ground. </p><p>They required almost as heavy a load as </p><p>the rest of the holes combined; they were </p><p>called the lifters. The fuses of these loads </p><p>were cut and timed so as to fire last, tha/ </p><p>each great shot might have a separate op- </p><p>portunity to heave up through its quarter </p><p>of the rock, rending and tearing all. </p><p> It is the lifter that smashes hard rock into</p><p>small fine bits. So, on occasion, would it </p><p>smash a man. </p><p> The men stood back a little as Bonfire</p><p>and the Gunner made ready to fire the </p><p>round. Black lengths of fuse dangled over </p><p>the white face of the rock like the tenacles </p><p>of a huge devil-fish. The four top-holes </p><p>were fired first; they ranged across the top </p><p>46 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>of the breast, about two feet from the roof. </p><p>The lirst fuse, which was cut at nine feet, </p><p>spat a wicked stream of lire over the Gun- </p><p>ner’s candle. </p><p> Instantly a curious commotion appeared</p><p>among the men. They began a hoarse cry— </p><p>“Fire in the heading!” </p><p> It passed quickly from mouth to mouth,</p><p>and echoed out and through the far, glim- </p><p>mering portal. </p><p> Each foot of fuse represented sixty sec-</p><p>onds of time. When Bonfire and the Gun- </p><p>ner set fire to the six breast-holes which lay </p><p>across the middle of the rock, the first fuse </p><p>in the top-hole measured less than six feet </p><p>and spat tire and hissed like an angry snake. </p><p>The lifters were fired last. Then, candle in </p><p>hand, Bonfire drove his men toward the</p><p>motor-engine waiting in the heading to </p><p>carry- them all to safety. Gallegher walked </p><p>at his side. </p><p> The men clumsily piled into the depths of</p><p>three empty muck-cars coupled to the </p><p>motor-engine, while Bonfire and the Gun- </p><p>ner climbed up on opposite sides of a fourth </p><p>car, which was nearly full of broken rock </p><p>bound for the dump. </p><p> “All aboard,” said Bonfire, and the little</p><p>train started with a jerk. </p><p> And, as they got under way, the Gunner</p><p>leaned over his side of the car and said— </p><p> “Well, Bonfire, if-”</p><p> He never finished the sentence. For,</p><p>even as he spoke, the loaded muck-car </p><p>reeled under them and gave a sudden lurch. </p><p>Bonfire sprang backwards to see the car </p><p>heel and crash into the ditch on the Gun- </p><p>ner’s side. </p><p> THE Gunner himself disappeared.</p><p> The motor-engine leapt ahead, car-</p><p>^ rying three cars and a snapped </p><p>coupling. It stopped within five lengths, </p><p>and some of the men came running back. </p><p>The muck-car lay on its side in the ditch; </p><p>and the Gunner, who had been pinned under </p><p>it in some way, cried out suffocatedly. </p><p>Another cry answered him. </p><p> “Fire in the heading!”</p><p>And a small band of Mexican shovelers </p><p>piled out of the cars and ran helter-skelter </p><p>for the portal. Bonfire stood gazing dow-n </p><p>at the wrecked car, his men behind him. </p><p>“Howr are you fixed, Gunnerl” he shouted. </p><p>The buried man’s voice came back. </p><p> “Fine, lad. Kind of short of breath, ac-</p><p>count of this load of muck on my chest. </p><p>But outside of that I guess I’m all together. </p><p>You lads better go while you can-” </p><p> For answer Bonfire sprang into the ditch</p><p>and tugged at the high side of the over- </p><p>turned muck-car with a futile, frantic grip. </p><p>His torso muscles leashed and creaked un- </p><p>der the unequal strain. His men went at </p><p>it, too, on all sides of the car, but to no good. </p><p>It was too much for them, and presently </p><p>they all stood back gasping. </p><p> “Fire in the heading!”</p><p> The cry rang back from the narrow walls.</p><p>A few of the men glanced at the blazing </p><p>fuses in the heading and ran. The motor- </p><p>man asked Bonfire for orders. </p><p> “No hurry,” said Bonfire coolly. “At</p><p>that, I guess we ain’t got time to unload this </p><p>muck car.” </p><p> The slender band of men who remained</p><p>cast furtive looks in the direction of the</p><p>sparking and hissing rock. A few whim- </p><p>pered for Bonfire to come on. But he </p><p>shook them off. </p><p> “Go on with you,” urged the buried man.</p><p>“There ain’t no use of you fellows sticking </p><p>around. I’m just as good as dead. Go on, </p><p>Bonfire, or the first thing you know she’ll </p><p>be licking all of you out along with me— </p><p>d’you hear? Bonfire—Bonfire, lad—you </p><p>haven’t gone yet?” </p><p> “No,” said Bonfire.</p><p> The men had shrunk back a little and left</p><p>him standing there. Nothing seemed to </p><p>move the man. </p><p> “No hurry,” he muttered, glancing at a</p><p>piece of iron rod he held in his right hand. </p><p>It was about tw’o feet long and spoon- </p><p>shaped at one end; a miner’s spoon, an im- </p><p>plement used by rockmen for removing </p><p>fuse and primer from a hole when a misfire </p><p>or something is the matter. </p><p> “Come on, Bonfire,” begged the men.</p><p>“It won’t do any good to stand here. You </p><p>heard what the Gunner said. Look at the </p><p>burning drift!” </p><p> Bonfire trimmed a stub of candle with his</p><p>knife. </p><p> “Fire in the heading!” shrilled the re-</p><p>lentless cry. </p><p> It fell to a piteous screech.</p><p> “Go on, then!” Bonfire roared of a sud-</p><p>den and the men fell back before the cold </p><p>fire that was in his eyes. </p><p> “What are you going to do?” muttered</p><p>one. </p><p> “Nothing,” said Bonfire. "I’m going to</p><p>stay and pull that load.” </p><p>Hard Rock </p><p>47 </p><p> He swung around.</p><p> “Aw, say, Bonfire,” growled the man</p><p>under the muck car. </p><p> “Fire in the heading!”</p><p> The motor-engine roared out toward the</p><p>portal as Bonfire turned and ran back into </p><p>the sparking breast. A deathly quiet fell </p><p>in the narrow drift. The dark was like </p><p>doom. It was accentuated rather than dis- </p><p>turbed by that ominous hiss and flash. </p><p>Bonfire and the Gunner were alone with . . . </p><p> “Fire in the heading!”</p><p> At the portal the men of the day shift</p><p>waited in characteristic attitudes. Many </p><p>cursed. They named the powder and the </p><p>rock horribly*. Others rolled cigarettes. </p><p>The Mexicans shrilled prayers for the dying </p><p>until Burns, the little timberman, made </p><p>out a few words of the gibberish and began</p><p>a fusillade of sharp rock. </p><p> “Ain't you a fine bunch of grave diggers!”</p><p>he roared. “Get out of this!” </p><p> Some of the men jumped up and ran</p><p>toward camp, screaming the news along </p><p>road and path. </p><p> “Fire in the heading!” moaned the siren</p><p>on the hill. </p><p> “He can't make it,” muttered Burns.</p><p>“He’s got less than four minutes to pull the </p><p>whole load. There ain’t a chance in the </p><p>world for him to get down to those bloody </p><p>lifters. And one of them, mind, will fire </p><p>the whole round!” </p><p> Then, suddenly, there came a short, whip-</p><p>like roar close at hand. </p><p> “One,” counted the men mechanically.</p><p>BONFIRE’S first act on entering </p><p>the drift had been to reach for a </p><p>sputtering length of fuse which dan- </p><p>gled from the top hole at the left. This fuse </p><p>had been fired first. He pulled lightly. A </p><p>shower of fine sand and a yellow stick of </p><p>giant powder slid into his hand. He </p><p>gnashed at the spark in the fuse with his </p><p>knife. It flamed within three feet and a </p><p>half from the primer. </p><p> Three and one-half minutes of life!</p><p> Bonfire worked swiftly with knife and</p><p>hand, guttering fuse and primer. For light </p><p>in that dark and narrow plac^ he clenched </p><p>the four-inch stub of candle between his </p><p>strong white teeth. When he reached the </p><p>four breast-holes, the first fuse read like a </p><p>ticker. </p><p> One minute and thirty seconds!</p><p> Bonfire began to curse the living rock.</p><p>And each red eye in that rugged face seemed </p><p>to twinkle back with infinite mirth. It </p><p>winked at him in a huge grin. Bonfire </p><p>whimpered as he stabbed at the terrible </p><p>eyes. Great rivulets of sweat ran down his </p><p>cheeks. He could feel the hot stream drip- </p><p>ping on his breast, welling under his arm- </p><p>pits. </p><p> His curses broke out afresh. He personi-</p><p>fied everything. He had a profane name </p><p>for the rock, for the powder, for the Gunner, </p><p>for the men who waited at the portal. The </p><p>very rock seemed possessed. It clutched </p><p>and clung to the imp of death in its]vitals like </p><p>a mother to her child. When a primer and </p><p>a fuse came readily to his hand he cursed it </p><p>endearingly; and when it evaded him almost </p><p>cunningly, he bellowed like an angry bull. </p><p> Mechanically, his motions were perfect.</p><p>There was no faltering, no trick of the hand </p><p>or eye wasted, and no wavering of heart.</p><p>The man appeared to array himself against </p><p>the grim breast of the rock with superb ef- </p><p>frontry. Now he laughed and sang at in- </p><p>tervals. </p><p> Then the first lifter! Less than a foot of</p><p>fuse lay between his knife and the primer. </p><p>Fie chuckled. Less than sixty seconds to </p><p>death! He tore at the second lifter-hole, </p><p>and the fuse, brittle and rotten with the </p><p>flying spark, came away in his scorched and </p><p>bleeding hands. </p><p> For an awful jiffy' of terror he was minded</p><p>to tear at the stubborn rock with his bare </p><p>mitts. He dug furiously in the lifter-hole, </p><p>reaching for the hidden primer with the </p><p>miner’s spoon. He nicked the spark without </p><p>a glance. There was no time. The third </p><p>lifter rose easily, and Bonfire laughed. His </p><p>knife touched the brass primer on one side </p><p>and the spark on the other. Less than fif- </p><p>teen ticks of the clock between him and . . \ </p><p> One hole remained.</p><p> He squatted on die floor, driving the</p><p>spoon warily against the wall of the hole, </p><p>for the lightest touch would drop that hot </p><p>spark into the primer. </p><p> Bonfire felt the spoon catch hold. A cold</p><p>sweat broke and welled all over him. He </p><p>raised the spoon carefully, so that its pre- </p><p>cious burden might not joggle, and then, as </p><p>he nipped the protruding yellow stick with </p><p>its stub of fuse, he knew that he held Death </p><p>spitting in his hands. </p><p> He turned and threw it toward the portal</p><p>with all his might. It hurtled through the </p><p>air and fell a good fifty’ feet beyond where </p><p>48 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the Gunner lay under the overturned muck- </p><p> car.</p><p> Then he crumpled against the side of the</p><p> rock, which received him on its huge white</p><p> breast almost gently. He wondered at the</p><p> sullen roar and the shock of air which flat-</p><p> tened him out.</p><p> And when the men came upon him, a lit-</p><p> tle later, he was lying face-down in a little</p><p> pile of primers and fuse beside the stingless</p><p> breast of rock. He breathed jerkily. With</p><p> gentle hands they turned him over on his</p><p> back. He seemed to grin at them, and the</p><p> grotesque effect was heightened by a</p><p> twisted stub of candle jauntily coked in the</p><p> comer of his mouth like a cherished per-</p><p> fecto.</p><p> ‘‘Awfully tired,” he said suddenly. Then</p><p> he wandered a little. “That you, Gunner?</p><p> No hurry; I’ll be ready for you in a minute.</p><p> Give me a smoke, somebody,” he added,</p><p> sitting up.</p><p> As they half carried him past the Mexi-</p><p> cans shoveling muck from the car which</p><p> still pinned the Gunner in the ditch, he</p><p> stood free.</p><p> “Hello, Gunner?” he called.</p><p> “That you, Bonfire?”</p><p> “How d’you feel?”</p><p> “Pretty good. How’s yourself?”</p><p> “Oh, I’m all right. Have you got any-</p><p> thing broke, Gunner?”</p><p>“No; I don’t think so.” The buried man </p><p>seemed to hesitate. “Say, lad,” he began. </p><p> “What?”</p><p> “That was a grand piece of work you just</p><p> put over. I’d liked to have done it my-</p><p> self.”</p><p> “Oh, you would, eh?”</p><p>“You heard me. And say, let me tell you </p><p>something, feUow. You wait till they get </p><p>this load of muck off my chest. Then you </p><p>look out for yourself!” The muffled voice </p><p>- broke off. Then, “D’you hear?” </p><p> Bonfire laughed a hard, soundless laugh</p><p> through closed lips.</p><p> “Oh, I’ll wait for you,” he said.</p><p> That was all. Bonfire laughed again, and</p><p>started back into the heading to look over </p><p>the reloading of the day shot- </p><p>Hard rock is hard rock. </p><p> TWO days later an empty chuck-</p><p>ed wagon returned to Sixty-Milt Sid- </p><p>ing. A big young man sat on the </p><p>seat beside the driver. lie dismounted at </p><p>they pulled up in front of the little company </p><p>offices. Inside he asked for the division </p><p>engineer. </p><p> A young man in spectacles came up to</p><p>the counter. </p><p> “What can I do for you?”</p><p> “I want a pass to Mojave. Been working</p><p>up at Sixty-Mile.” </p><p> Without further ceremony the engineer</p><p>drew forward a book of blue railroad trans- </p><p>portation. His fountain-pen paused. </p><p>“Name?” </p><p> The big young man turned his face, the</p><p>sole attractions of which were a twisted </p><p>nose, a spreading patch of purple under </p><p>each eye, some caked mud and blood, and a </p><p>swollen lip, to his questioner. </p><p> “Cobleigb. Bonfire Cobleigh,” was hii</p><p>answer. </p><p> The engineer stared at him.</p><p> “Bonfire Cobleigh? Why, only the other</p><p>day a big fellow was in here asking for you. </p><p>I sent him up to Sixty-Mile. You must</p><p>have met him-” </p><p> Bonfire nodded grimly.</p><p> “I met him, all right. And I wasn’t the</p><p>only one either. It might interest you to </p><p>know that you’ve got a new walking-boss </p><p>up there now. Take a slant at my face; it's </p><p>a quince, but it ain’t a marker to what the </p><p>old Gunner handed to the Walker, Jeff Call, </p><p>when he got through with me! He got my </p><p>job, and then he got Jeff’s—but say!” </p><p>Bonfire had his pass; now he paused in </p><p>the door, flashing a rare bright look upon </p><p>the bewildered young man in spectacles. </p><p> “If anybody comes in here asking for me,</p><p>tell him which way I went, will you, kid?” </p><p>Author of “In </p><p> THEr WHALEPX</p><p> A Complete Novelette</p><p> &amp;</p><p> Frederick</p><p>"William </p><p>Wclllcice </p><p>the Bank Fog," “Winter Fishing," etc. </p><p>CHAPTER I </p><p>I AM LUCKY TO FIND A BERTH </p><p> T IS with some little trepidation</p><p>that I start in spinning this yarn, </p><p>because I have an instinctive </p><p>feeling that it will be ridiculed </p><p>and curt y dismissed as being what old sail- </p><p>ors would call “a twister.” When a man </p><p>has been kicked out of a Consul’s office and </p><p>designated as a “crazy shellback;” when he </p><p>has been laughed at and called ugly names; </p><p>when his most solemn oath has been the </p><p>subject for incredulous jeers and his charac- </p><p>ter as a sober citizen is doubted, he naturally </p><p>becomes apprehensive in opening up afresh </p><p>an affair which he has tried hard to forget. </p><p> My position at the present time is such</p><p>that my connection with the affair would </p><p>not redound to my credit, and I have no </p><p>desire to lose caste by coming out under my </p><p>own name and relating the circumstances </p><p>as they actually happened. One man be- </p><p>lieves me, and it is with reluctance that I </p><p>concede to his request and give to the world </p><p>a secret which has rankled in my mind for </p><p>many, many years. A sensitiveness to the </p><p>shafts of ridicule has always been the weak </p><p>point in my armor, but by employing ficti- </p><p>tious names of persons and vessels con- </p><p>cerned, I shield myself from being made a </p><p>target for personal remarks of a derisive and </p><p>satirical nature. </p><p> Somewhere or other I read of a man who</p><p>related the story of his life to a party of </p><p>Iriends. He was a jolly sort of fellow and his</p><p>story was a heartrending one, but on its </p><p>conclusion the audience were convulsed in </p><p>laughter and refused to believe that his tale </p><p>was true. I regard myself in the same light, </p><p>and being an old sailor, my narrative, like </p><p>that of the humorist, will probably be taken </p><p>with a grain of salt. Go ahead, dear reader, </p><p>and take it whatever way you like. I know </p><p>it is real enough to me. </p><p> I was bom and brought up in a little</p><p>coast town in the Pine Tree State, and, like </p><p>a good many Down-East youngsters, I broke </p><p>away for sea at an early age. After two or </p><p>three years’ hard grinding in the mill of </p><p>’foremast experience I came out “ground </p><p>and bolted,” but my parents having died </p><p>while I was learning to hand, reef and steer, </p><p>I was left to work out my own traverse in </p><p>life. After a bitter time in some hard craft, </p><p>I gained a master’s certificate in Liverpool. </p><p>And when the Civil War broke out, I shipped </p><p>as second mate aboard cotton ships running </p><p>the blockade into Wilmington and Charles- </p><p>ton. Though a Northerner in sympathyy </p><p>and by birth, I, with many others, was cap- </p><p>tured by a Federal cruiser and promptly </p><p>“jugged.” After two months’ confinement, </p><p>I escaped and lived very precariously for a </p><p>lengthy period, and in November, 1866, was </p><p>in New York—stranded. </p><p> The period of depression after the war</p><p>had set in and business was bad in the </p><p>United States then. Everybody was re- </p><p>trenching; money was scarce and employ- </p><p>ment was scarcer. The Alabama and Con- </p><p>federate privateers had practically destroyed </p><p>the American merchant marine and, with </p><p>49 </p><p> 50	Adventure</p><p>the stagnation in shipping which prevailed, </p><p>starv ing sailormen loafed around the water- </p><p>front, sleeping in warehouses and living on </p><p>the bounty of more fortunate shellbacks </p><p>aboard the vessels. Every boarding-house </p><p>on South and Water Streets was crammed </p><p>with seafarers ready to sign away their liber- </p><p>ty for a year without remuneration as long </p><p>as they could till a gnawing stomach. </p><p> Among this crowd of destitutes, I was</p><p>one of the fortunate ones, having been </p><p>taken in by Dennis Sullivan after spending </p><p>a week or two “living in the street and </p><p>boarding in the market.” Sullivan, fa- </p><p>miliarly known to sailormen as “Hash" </p><p>Sullivan, ran a boarding-house on Oliver </p><p>Street, and a worse “sailor-robber” never </p><p>drew breath. He was Irish and a “plug- </p><p>ugly" for looks, and his cognomen came</p><p>from the form of diet which was the piece </p><p>de resistance at his establishment. </p><p>WHEN I blew into Hash Sullivan’s </p><p>my whole worldly possessions con- </p><p>sisted of my clothes and a slieath- </p><p>knife. The clothes, for convenience and </p><p>decency’s sake, I carried on my back; they </p><p>consisted of an old felt “bucko” hat, a </p><p>woolen shirt, a pair of tar-stained dungaree </p><p>pants, and a pair of “slipshods”—sea-boots </p><p>with the uppers cut off. Socks I didn’t </p><p>have. The knife and sheath were sup- </p><p>ported around my waist by a strap which </p><p>originally formed part of a horse’s harness, </p><p>but when Sullivan saw it, he promptly took </p><p>it away from me, saying: </p><p> “Young fellow, I wouldn’t wear that belt.</p><p>There is nawthin’ looks so well on a sailor </p><p>as a good smart rope-yarn.” </p><p> So my clothes and knife were afterwards</p><p>held together and supported by a piece of </p><p>marline, and my belt went to fit out some </p><p>ether poor devil outward bound. </p><p> I lived a good three or four weeks at</p><p>Sullivan's, and during the whole of that </p><p>time I scoured the docks looking for a ship. </p><p>Masters and mates I interviewed by the </p><p>score. Some civilly declined my services, </p><p>while others, tired of being importuned by </p><p>the hosts of desperate sailormen thronging </p><p>the wharves, kicked me off their decks with </p><p>curses and bitter oaths. It was a miserable </p><p>lime; cold receptions and cold weather for </p><p>a half'dad man, and I think il I had re- </p><p>mained ashore any longer than I did, I </p><p>would have thrown myself off the dock and </p><p>ended my misery. </p><p> I considered myself unusually fortunate</p><p>when the master of au English ship bound </p><p>for Australia came along to the boarding- </p><p>house and picked me out to make up his </p><p>crew. Though I was a qualified navigator </p><p>and holding a “lime-juice” ticket for com- </p><p>petency as master mariner, 1 was only too </p><p>glad to stick my fist on the articles of the </p><p>ship Magician as an able seamen at twenty- </p><p>five dollars a month and two months’ ad- </p><p>vance. My fifty dollars was to be paid after </p><p>the ship had sailed, and Mr. Sullivan took </p><p>the note “in payment for board, lodging </p><p>and outfit,” giving me a dollar to “blow” </p><p>myself with before I went aboard. </p><p> The dollar provided a few schooners of</p><p>beer for my less fortunate companions at </p><p>the boarding-house, and with a dirty’ canvas </p><p>bag containing my outfit—a sackful of </p><p>straw known as a “donkey’s breakfast,” </p><p>shirt and pants made of “dog’s wool and</p><p>oakum,” a nondescript blanket and a pair </p><p>of second-hand sea-boots—I, with the oth- </p><p>ers, was escorted aboard the ship by Sulli- </p><p>van’s roughneck runners and taken in hand </p><p>by the mate. </p><p> A towboat hauled us down the harbor and</p><p>into the Bay. We were turned to rigging </p><p>out the jibboom, setting up the headgear, </p><p>and straightening out the rigger’s snarls. </p><p>Two days later, we hauled out to the Scot- </p><p>land Lightship and made sail, and if ever </p><p>a crew of shellbacks chantyed up topsail </p><p>halyards lustily, it was the Magician's </p><p>crowd. </p><p> I was something of a chantyman my-</p><p>self, and I felt so good at smelling salt water </p><p>again and feeling a ship’s deck under my feet </p><p>that I sang and chorused for the sheer joy </p><p>of being outward bound. By the aid of </p><p>muscles and “Whisky Johnny,” “We’re </p><p>All Bound to Go!” “Blow the Man Down,” </p><p>and “Santa Anna Won the Day’,” we mast- </p><p>headed the yards and sheeted home until </p><p>we had all the muslin flying and braces </p><p>strung, and the big Australiaman was </p><p>punching along with the lee froth bubbling </p><p>in the scuppers and licking over the topgal- </p><p>lant rail. </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>I HAVE A FALLING OUT </p><p>VX/’ITEN a man has been “on the beach” </p><p>*	’ for a long spell, he appreciates being</p><p>at sea again. New York and starvation </p><p>seemed like a bad dream, and I was looking </p><p>The Whaler </p><p>51 </p><p>forward to a good time on the Magician. </p><p>Her skipper seemed a very fine sort of man, </p><p>and the mates were as good as sailors will </p><p>allow mates to be. The grub was “lime- </p><p>juicer style”—not much of a variety, but </p><p>it was of good qaulity and the bread barge </p><p>was always filled without question. Plenty </p><p>of biscuit meant plenty of those favorite </p><p>sea dishes, cracker hash and dandyfunk. </p><p> The voyage also would be a lengthy one—</p><p>New York to Melbourne, via the Cape, and </p><p>Melbourne to England by way of the Horn </p><p>—and though I was serving in a subordinate </p><p>capacity, yet I was glad to do it and happy </p><p>in the thought that I had shelter and food </p><p>for a year at least. </p><p> With a roaring westerly blowing over the</p><p>quarter, we stood away to the east’ard on </p><p>the old deepwaterman’s track to pick up </p><p>the northeast trades for a shoot across the </p><p>Line, and I can remember, after my trick </p><p>at the wheel, how delighted I was with the</p><p>ship’s running qualities and the easy man- </p><p>ner in which she steered. This is quite an </p><p>important thing on an Australian voyage, </p><p>where over four thousand miles of easting is </p><p>run with square yards and a heavy sea. </p><p>Sailors have no use for a vessel that is likely </p><p>to prove a “terror” when running the east- </p><p>ing down. </p><p> We dropped the land astern that morning.</p><p>During the day the wind held strong and we </p><p>sailed “at the rate of knots” with a main- </p><p>skysail set. Towards nightfall the wind </p><p>hauled southerly with fog. When I came </p><p>on watch at four next morning, the ship was </p><p>pitching and rolling in a lumpish sea, while </p><p>fog shrouded everything. The wind was </p><p>coming away squally, and when our star- </p><p>bowlines mustered aft, the second mate </p><p>passed the word, “In royals and flying jib!” </p><p> We manned the royal gear and clewed up</p><p>the sails, and while some of the watch went </p><p>aloft to furl, I and two others went for’ard </p><p>on the fo c s le head to tackle the flying jib. </p><p>The fog was very thick—so thick that it was </p><p>impossible to sec the flying jibboom from </p><p>the cathead. I can remember, after we had </p><p>slacked away on the halyards and manned </p><p>the downhaul, the second mate coming </p><p>for ard and singing out to the three of us: </p><p> Come.aft here, some of you, when you</p><p>git that jib down. Git the horn for’ard— </p><p>it s gittin’ thicker’n pea soup.” </p><p> I gave my two mates a nudge.</p><p> Run along,-’ I said. “I can muzzle that</p><p>pocket handkerchief all right.” </p><p> And while they made their way aft, I</p><p>clambered over the bows and out to where </p><p>the flying jib was bellying and slatting </p><p>around in the breeze. </p><p> We carried one of those old-fashioned</p><p>sky-raking bowsprits protruding very far </p><p>out over the water, and by the time I </p><p>reached the flying jibboom footropes, the </p><p>vessel was blotted out in the thickness of </p><p>the vapor, while the horn came through </p><p>the veil in a pitifully feeble drone. As I lis- </p><p>tened to the roar of the bow wave beneath </p><p>and the scarce-heard wail of the horn, and </p><p>saw the dim halo of our lights, I thought it </p><p>would be just the kind of morning for a bad </p><p>collision. The notion made me shiver and </p><p>look around apprehensively, but the slatting </p><p>jib gave me little time for thoughts of that </p><p>nature. Clambering up the stay I was busi- </p><p>ly engaged in stamping the hanks down </p><p>with my sea-booted feet. </p><p> Humming a little song to myself, I was</p><p>passing the stops, when the wail of a fog-</p><p>horn came to my ears. I listened intently, </p><p>thinking at first that it was our own. As I </p><p>paused in my W'ork, with nerv es astrain. a </p><p>wall of misty whiteness came sweeping out </p><p>of the murk on our starboard. While I </p><p>yelled in excited fright, the luminous bulk </p><p>took the shape of the headsails and double </p><p>topsails of a large ship crossing our bows! </p><p>THINGS happened with frightful </p><p>suddenness. While I hung to the </p><p>rolled-up canvas of the flying jib </p><p>with skin tingling and hair raised in alarm, </p><p>the other vessel stormed past and I thought </p><p>she was going clear until I saw myself look- </p><p>ing down over her deck and felt the tip of </p><p>the boom strike the stranger’s mizzen rig- </p><p>ging. As soon as I felt the shock. I jumped </p><p>and landed with a thump into the bottom of </p><p>a quarter-boat outslungon davits, and while </p><p>I was picking myself up there was a crash, </p><p>a volley of shouts and curses, and then both </p><p>vessels must have gone clear. </p><p> My legs seemed paralyzed, and I fancied</p><p>for a moment that I had broken my back </p><p>when I struck the thwarts of the boat. But </p><p>in a few’ seconds the numbness departed, </p><p>and 1 became conscious of a hoarse voice </p><p>shouting: </p><p> “Fetch a lantern here, some o’ you! That</p><p>blasted Dutchman has stove th’ whole </p><p>quarter in—Th’ bloody bumpkin’s gone. </p><p>Braces adrift. Look alive!” </p><p> A lantern was brought, casting a halo of</p><p>5~ </p><p>Adventure </p><p>yellow in the mist, and a voice came booming: </p><p>“How’s that boat? Is she stove? </p><p>Thought I hard somethin’ failin' into it. </p><p>Look an’ see." </p><p> Now I was fully conscious of everything</p><p>that was happening below me, but I made </p><p>no attempt to rise out of the boat. I don’t </p><p>know why. Probably I had not recovered </p><p>from the shock. Anyway, I lay across the </p><p>thwart until a man's head appeared over </p><p>the gunwale and I was revealed in the light </p><p>of the lantern he held. </p><p> “Sink me!" he shouted. “Here’s a man a</p><p>lyin’ in here-” </p><p> “Is he dead?” boomed the commanding</p><p>voice below. </p><p> “Are ye dead, shipmate?” questioned the</p><p>man in all seriousness, flashing the lamp </p><p>over me. </p><p> “No,” I managed to answer. “Just</p><p>shook up a bit, that’s all. I’ll tumble out </p><p>if you’ll give me a hand.” </p><p> And I crawled painfully over the gunwale</p><p>and, stepping down on deck, found myself </p><p>in the midst of a mob of men. One of them, </p><p>a great, black-bearded fellow, grasped the </p><p>lantern and held it up in front of my face. </p><p> “Waal, an' where did you spring from?”</p><p>he asked harshly. </p><p> “Fell off the jibboom of that other ves-</p><p>sel,” I replied. </p><p> “Oh. ye did. did ye?”</p><p>The man’s tone was vindictive and nasty. </p><p>“Where in the blazes were yer eyes? </p><p>Couldn’t ye hear us? What vessel was that </p><p>anyway? One o’ yer Cape Horners out t’ </p><p>trim th' Fly in' Cloud, eh?” </p><p> “No, sir,’ I answered respectfully. “She</p><p>was an English ship—the Magician bound </p><p>from New York to Melbourne-” </p><p> “Huh! Bloody lime juicer! Might ha’</p><p>known it. Starvation an’ ease, an’ watch </p><p>on deck snoozin’ in th’ lee o’ somethin’ </p><p>’stead o’ keepin’ a good lookout.” </p><p>Grumbling to himself he laid the lantern </p><p>on deck. </p><p> “An’ who told ye t’ come aboard here?”</p><p>he continued. “What d’ye think we’re goin’ </p><p>t’ do with ye?” </p><p> “I'll turn to,” I answered.</p><p> “Ye’ll turn to, will ye?” he snapped.</p><p>“An1 what d’ye think we’re runnin’—a </p><p>blasted sailor’s home for every calashee </p><p>scrub that flops aboard? This is a whaler, </p><p>not a packet ship. Have you ever gone </p><p>whalin’?” </p><p> I replied in the negative. A whalerl A</p><p>dirty, oily “spouter,” outward bound, most </p><p>likely, on one of their two and three year </p><p>voyages! Whales hips! A merchant sailor's </p><p>horror. He watched me with his savage </p><p>eyes glinting in the light of the lamp. </p><p> “Kin ye swim?” he inquired threateningly.</p><p> “Yes, sir,” 1 replied, wondering at the</p><p>man’s peculiar aggressiveness. </p><p> “Waal, I cal’late ye’d better start in an'</p><p>do it,” he growled menacingly. “Over th’ </p><p>rail ye go now, or I’ll help ye.” </p><p> “What?” I cried in horrified consterna-</p><p>tion. “Good Heavens, sir, you don’t mean </p><p>that!” </p><p> There was no mistaking his words when</p><p>he advanced toward me with his shoulders </p><p>hunched and arms outstretched. The men </p><p>who had been working at the port braces </p><p>knocked off to look on. As the great brute </p><p>advanced, I whipped out my knife. </p><p> “Sheer off!” I snarled. “I don’t know</p><p>whether you're joking or not, but, by th’ </p><p>hook block, I'll give you a tight if you’re </p><p>looking for one.”</p><p> He stopped short on seeing the knife in</p><p>my hand. </p><p> “Trundle that out of his fist!” he cried to</p><p>the assembled men. “Give him a toi5. \V </p><p>don’t want him aboard here.” </p><p> A rough-looking fellow picked j capstan</p><p>bar out of the rack and came towards me </p><p>with the weapon upraised for a blow. I </p><p>backed to the taflraii with my left arm over </p><p>my head and the knife grasped tightly in </p><p>my right fist; with wits working and eyes </p><p>roaming for a chance of escape from the </p><p>murderous intent of the whaler's crew. </p><p> It was unheard of; a ghastly nightmare,</p><p>and momentarily I expected to awake and </p><p>find it all a bad dream. I can remember the </p><p>savage faces illuminated in the foggy glare </p><p>from the lantern, and in their countenances </p><p>not a revelation of pity or horror was </p><p>shown. The black-bearded man was staring </p><p>at me with a sinister, wolfish look in his </p><p>eyes, and the man advancing with the bar </p><p>seemed to be imbued with a certain joy of </p><p>combat, a lustful, brutal expression in his </p><p>face and figure which made me make up </p><p>my mind to ru.h in and drive my knife into </p><p>his heart. </p><p>THEN, of a sudden, the man paused </p><p>and lowered his weapon. </p><p> “Why, sink me! I believe it's</p><p>Jack Dixon, what was second mate o’ th’ </p><p>Bahama Belle-” </p><p>The Whaler </p><p>53 </p><p> “Eh?” snapped the man of the beard.</p><p> On the mention of my old blockade run-</p><p> ner’s name, I recognized the man who had</p><p> identified me as Joe Smith, one of her crew</p><p> who had escaped prison some time before I</p><p> did and, clutching at a straw, I lowered my</p><p> knife.</p><p> "Aye, right you are, Joe,” I said. “And</p><p> I’m thinking this is a poor reception for an</p><p> old shipmate.”</p><p> Joe turned and spoke to the other.</p><p> “He’s all right, Cap’en. He’s an old ship-</p><p> mate o’ mine—second mate o’ th’ Bahama</p><p> Belle runnin’ th’ Yankee lines between New</p><p> Providence an’ Charleston. Good fel-</p><p> low-”</p><p> The Whaler Captain made a gesture.</p><p> “Come here, you! Put up your dirk. We</p><p> were only jokin’.”</p><p> Thinking it was a particularly callous</p><p> and bloody-minded joke, I slipped the</p><p> knife into the sheath and stepped gingerly</p><p> forward.</p><p> “Kin ye navigate?”</p><p> “Yes, sir,” I replied.</p><p> The skipper turned to Joe.</p><p> “Kin he?”</p><p> “Oh, yes, sir,” replied the man. “He’s</p><p> a navigator all right.”</p><p> “I hold a British Board of Trade certifi-</p><p> cate of competency as master,” I volun-</p><p> teered.</p><p> “Then, by Judas, you’re th’ man we</p><p> want!” cried the whaling skipper, bringing</p><p> his heavy hand down on my shoulder.</p><p> “Lord Harry! But I thought ye were</p><p> nawthin’ more nor less than some poor devil</p><p> of a foremast hand! An’ ye kin navigate,</p><p> eh? Take sextant sights by th’ sun, eh?”</p><p> “Yes, sir, and by the moon and stars as</p><p> well.”</p><p> I hastened to add my accomplishments:</p><p> “Time sights, double altitudes and lunars</p><p> for chronometer ratings—I’ve had practise</p><p> with them all, and if you have instru-</p><p> ments-”</p><p> “We have them,” he interrupted. “Come</p><p> down below, sir.”</p><p> And he led the way into the cabin.</p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>THE WHALER AND HER CREW </p><p> TX^HEN I was precipitated upon the</p><p> whaling vessel in the manner de-</p><p> scribed, I calculated that we were to the</p><p>south’ard of Nantucket Shoals. The whaler </p><p>had fitted out in New Bedford and had </p><p>stood to the south’ard for an offing after </p><p>clearing Buzzard’s Bay. Coming about, she </p><p>was running to the east’ard when she crossed </p><p>the Magician s bows and narrowly escaped </p><p>being cut in half. So the black-bearded </p><p>man told me as he lit the cabin lamp, and I </p><p>knew then that I was on an outward bound </p><p>“spouter.” </p><p> “I’m th’ master o’ this vessel,” he said,</p><p>as he motioned me to be seated on the </p><p>cushioned transom. “My name’s Silvera </p><p>—Captain Rodriquez Silvera. an’ this ves- </p><p>sel’s the whalin’ bark Arclurus, bound on a </p><p>southern sperm-whale cruise. I’m no navi- </p><p>gator, ’cept by dead reckonin’, an’ my first </p><p>officer, who was supposed to do th’ naviga- </p><p>ting has gone an’ died on me. Came aboard </p><p>in Noo Bedford full as a tick, took to his </p><p>bunk, an’ croaked this momin’. You’ll </p><p>come in nice an’ handy to take his place, </p><p>an’ I reckon you won’t kick, eh?” </p><p> “I won’t kick, Captain.”</p><p> “Not even for a long whalin’ cruise?"</p><p>“No, sir,” I replied, “but I’m no whale- </p><p>man-” </p><p> “Ye don’t need t’ be,” he answered. “All</p><p>as we’ll ask ye t’ do ’ull be t’ navigate th’ </p><p>vessel t’ where we want her t’ go. Ye don’t </p><p>have nawthin’ t’ do with th’ whalin’ part </p><p>of it. Navigate an’ that’s all. I'll give ye </p><p>fifty dollars a month, an’ ye kin live aft </p><p>here. </p><p> “Ye kin take that gaudy first mate’s</p><p>room an’ his gear as soon as we git him </p><p>cleared out— Wait a minute. I’ll have </p><p>him cleared out now so’s ye kin take aholt </p><p>an’ start right in.” </p><p> He arose and clambered up the compan-</p><p>ionway steps, and I could hear him calling </p><p>to the watch on deck. WTien he came be- </p><p>low again, four ragged-looking, unkempt </p><p>ruffia.is followed him. </p><p> “Git tliat stiff outa his bunk an’ heave</p><p>him over th’ rail-” </p><p> “Sew him up, sir?” inquired one of the</p><p>men. </p><p> “Heave him over, I said,” snapped Cap-</p><p>tain Silvera sharply. “I’ve got no can\ is </p><p>to waste on that beach-comber. Ye kin </p><p>lash somethin’ to his heels as a sinker— </p><p>No, blast him, jest shove him over as he is. </p><p>Go ahead, now!” </p><p> And while I remained seated, mute with</p><p>surprise and shocked at such callou? words, </p><p>the men entered the mate’s room and </p><p>.S4 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>unceremoniously lugged the dead body of a </p><p>man out of the berth and up on deck. I </p><p>could hear their feet shuttling along the </p><p>planks overhead; heard the barking, “One! </p><p>Two! Three! An’ heave!” as they swung </p><p>their burden, and then the sullen splash as </p><p>the body struck the water. Captain Sil- </p><p>vera’s harsh voice roused me from the terror </p><p>of my thoughts at this uufeeling piece of </p><p>desecration. </p><p> “Your room’s ready for ye, Mister Dixon,</p><p>but afore ye turn in. I'd like ye t’ fix up our </p><p>course. 1 want t’ shape for th’ Western </p><p>Islands. Here’s th’ chart, dividers, rulers </p><p>an’ pencil." </p><p> I gave him the course in a few seconds,</p><p>and he shouted it up the open companion- </p><p>way to the deck officer. </p><p> THUS, within twenty-four hours I</p><p>was metamorphosed from Jack Dix- </p><p>on, A. B., on the merchant ship </p><p>Magician to Mister Dixon, navigating officer </p><p>on the whaling bark Arclurus. I had </p><p>changed my flag from the “blood and guts’’ </p><p>of old England to the stars and stripes of the </p><p>United States. </p><p> I had twice been in danger of losing my</p><p>life—I had no doubt whatever that Captain </p><p>Silvera would have given me a swim had </p><p>not Joe Smith recognized me and mentioned </p><p>the fact that 1 was a navigator—and here </p><p>I was, logged for a lengthy voyage, with </p><p>exceedingly doubtful company, a brute of a </p><p>Portuguese Yankee for skipper, and in a </p><p>trade which I. as a merchant sailor, de- </p><p>tested with the hereditary hatred of the </p><p>bluewater shellback. However, I was in no </p><p>position to choose. I had benefited by the </p><p>change which luck had hove me into, but a </p><p>nameless dread gripped my heart whenever </p><p>I thought of the incident of the early morn- </p><p>ing. and I shivered involuntarily as I step- </p><p>ped into the berth assigned to me. </p><p> Scratching a match, I found the bulkhead</p><p>lamp and lit it, and by its feeble light I saw </p><p>that the room was of the ordinary type, with </p><p>bunk and drawers underneath, a washstand </p><p>with a tumbler and water-bottle rack over it, </p><p>a small table and a clothes locker. At the </p><p>foot of the bunk was a bookshelf equipped </p><p>with a brine-stained “Navigator.’' by </p><p>Nathaniel Bowditch, a book of azimuth </p><p>tables, “Nautical Almanac," directories and </p><p>“Sailing Directions"; and a few shallow </p><p>novels of the type affected by some officers </p><p>completed the library. The bedclothes in </p><p>the bunk were dirty and disarranged, and I </p><p>had another shock when I saw that the pil- </p><p>low was stained with blood. </p><p> “Lord Harry!” 1 muttered apprehen-</p><p>sively. “What Lind of a packet have I </p><p>blown aboard of?” </p><p> Silvera opened the door at this juncture.</p><p>He must have noticed me staring at the </p><p>bloody pillow. </p><p> “I’ll get th’ stooard t’ dear that dunnage</p><p>away an’ put fresh clothes in that bunk," </p><p>he said as he entered. “You're wonderin’ </p><p>whar that mess came from, eh?” </p><p> And as I nodded dumbly he laughed.</p><p>“That come from his head. He was </p><p>drunk when he come aboard in Noo Bedford </p><p>an’ fell down th’ cabin gangway an’ stove </p><p>his thick skull. I cal’late that’s what fin- </p><p>ished him.” </p><p> Then, with an assumption of heartiness,</p><p>he slapped me on the back. </p><p> “You don’t want t’ mind our little joke</p><p>this rnornin’, Dixon. We whalers are rough </p><p>an’ ready but we don’t mean no harm. </p><p>Marchant ways ain't whaleship wav's. </p><p>Thar’ ain't no brass an' gold lace aL-nr-i </p><p>these craft, but you'll find things’ll be all </p><p>right ef ye do yer duty. Now I reckon </p><p>ye’ll find Lamson’s rig-out ’ull ab-ut lit ye,</p><p>so jest take ’em an’ use ’em. </p><p> “Thar’s a good kumometer here—a noo</p><p>one showin’ Greenwich mean time an’ </p><p>rated one second slow daily. I’ve kep’ it </p><p>wound up while that joker was Ivin’ on his </p><p>beam ends. I’ve got a sex’ant in my berth </p><p>which I’ll hand ye later. Git them lime- </p><p>juicer’s dungarees off ye an’ come t' break- </p><p>fast. It’ll be ready in a few minutes." </p><p> Feeling a little more composed men-</p><p>tally, I changed my tarry rags for more re- </p><p>spectable apparel, and sat down to break- </p><p>fast with the queerest company of human </p><p>beings it was ever my lot to be shipmates </p><p>with. Two of the men were vellow-skinned </p><p>Portuguese half-breeds from the Azores, </p><p>named Fernandez and Francisco; the other </p><p>two were Polynesians—one being, without </p><p>doubt, the ugliest and most ferocious look- </p><p>ing character 1 had ever seen. His cheeks </p><p>were tattooed in bluish concentric rings </p><p>while his huge white teeth were filed into </p><p>saw-like poin ts. When he smiled, the aspect </p><p>of his countenance was frightful and repel- </p><p>lent. All four were clad in colored flannel </p><p>shirts, and they ate like wolves, boiled beef </p><p>and coffee disappearing down their capaci- </p><p>ous mouths like coal into a furnace. </p><p>The Whaler </p><p>55 </p><p> Having spent a good deal of time in the</p><p>Southern States, I could be excused for </p><p>wondering why four “blacks” were allowed </p><p>to eat aft in the cabin. The skipper must </p><p>have sensed my mental astonishment. </p><p> “Let me make ye acquainted with th’</p><p>second an’ fourth mates.” Fernandez and </p><p>Francisco nodded. “The other gents are </p><p>Hilo Peter an’ Tahiti Jack—our harpoon- </p><p>eers.” </p><p> The Polynesians grinned acknowledg-</p><p>ment, Tahiti Jack looking a veritable ogre </p><p>with his disfigured cheeks and serrated </p><p>teeth. </p><p> I have seen some hard cases in my day,</p><p>but that whaler’s crew impressed me as </p><p>being the most cut-throat looking crowd </p><p>I ever clapped eyes on. Not a man but </p><p>what had a scar or disfigurement of some </p><p>sort on his person; all had a lurching hard- </p><p>bitten appearance, while the language they </p><p>used was vile enough for an Atlantic packet </p><p>ship’s fo’c’s’le. </p><p>THE vessel seemed to me to be </p><p>rather an unusual craft for the whal- </p><p>ing business, by recollection of sun- </p><p>dry Nantucketers and Vineyard Haven </p><p>“spouters” I had seen at sea being vastly</p><p>different from the A returns in almost every </p><p>way. The orthodox South-Seaman was a </p><p>square-stemed, apple-bowed type f&gt;f wind- </p><p>jammer; clumsy looking, with wretchedly </p><p>cut sails, bowsprit steeved up like a mast, a </p><p>housed-in poop, and no sail above topgal- </p><p>lants. </p><p> The Arcturus had clipper lines and all</p><p>the appearance of a clipper; her yards </p><p>were very square, her masts lofty and with </p><p>a rake aft, and the length of mast above her </p><p>main royal induced me to believe that she </p><p>once crossed a sky sail yard. She was a </p><p>clipper to sail as well. Silvera afterwards </p><p>told me that she had beeen built for the </p><p>“live ebony” trade—otherwise slaving— </p><p>out when she had been put out of that busi- </p><p>ness he and a few others had bought her and </p><p>fitted her out for whaling. </p><p> Something of her appearance was spoiled</p><p>by the ungainly whaleboat davits—three to </p><p>starboard and one to port. Two spare boats </p><p>lay bottom-up on the gallows aft, and amid- </p><p>ships were placed the brick tryworks, with a </p><p>huge pile of kindling-wood stacked around </p><p>them. On top of the for’ard house was a </p><p>great tarpaulined box which, I deduced was </p><p>a water tank. </p><p> I counted thirty men in our crew. They</p><p>seem to have been composed of even' na- </p><p>tionality under the sun—Americans, Portu- </p><p>guese, Scotch, English, Polynesians, Scandi- </p><p>navians, and negroes; a rough-and-tough </p><p>looking crowd, but all expert whalemen, </p><p>filling the positions of harpooners, boat </p><p>steerers, coopers, blacksmiths and seamen. </p><p>So much for the Arcturus and her company. </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>I DRINK WITH SILVERA </p><p>WE PICKED up the northeast trades </p><p>after sighting Gran Canaria, and in </p><p>sunshine, under blue skies and over bluer </p><p>water, we ambled lazily on our aimless </p><p>course. At night we hove to in order to </p><p>cover the whaling grounds in daylight. </p><p> Silvera remained as agreeable as ever, but</p><p>the man seemed to be utterly heartless, </p><p>though I can not say he was severe in hand- </p><p>ling the crew; in fact he permitted liberties </p><p>which would not have been tolerated for an </p><p>instant upon merchant ships. He was pleas- </p><p>ant to talk to and a good conversationalist, </p><p>but I cannot remember in any of his dis- </p><p>courses with me a single sentence which </p><p>revealed a trace of sympathetic utterance. </p><p> He was an atheist and a man who scorned</p><p>emotion of any sort, and from the amount </p><p>of knowledge he seemed to possess regarding</p><p>the Congo and Bonny Rivers. Benin and the </p><p>Dahomey coast, I surmised that he had </p><p>been a slaver captain or officer at some time </p><p>in his life. Men who can calmly ‘‘jettison'” </p><p>their living cargo into a shark-infested sea </p><p>when pursued by a cruiser, have case- </p><p>hardened their hearts against any appeal to </p><p>feeling and compassion. </p><p> Looking over the notes from which I am</p><p>compiling this narrative, I find but a daily </p><p>sequence of entries for the next two weeks: </p><p> "Fine weather. Wind N. E., fresh. Vessel</p><p>under all plain sail running to s'thard. People em- </p><p>ployed on gear. No fish sighted. Lat. by obs.- </p><p>Long.-Log.-Bar.-. So ends this day." </p><p> At night we brought to the wind.</p><p> According to my instructions from Sil-</p><p>vera, we gave the Cape Verde Islands a </p><p>wide berth and stood well over to the east- </p><p>ward of the thirtieth meridian. </p><p> “A good whalin’ ground,” explained the</p><p>skipper. “Then we’ll go to the Brazil </p><p>bank.” </p><p>Adventure </p><p> But luck seemed to have deserted us on</p><p>reaching our objective point, and though the </p><p>mast lookouts were manned all day, not a </p><p>single hail of “There she blows!" was </p><p>sounded. </p><p> As we were right in the track of the home-</p><p>ward-bound ships from Australia and the </p><p>Cape bound for the British Channel, as </p><p>well as the outward ships from American </p><p>ports, we saw many of them at a distance. </p><p>With the desire for sighting and hailing </p><p>passing vessels which is imbued in all deep- </p><p>water sailormen, Silvera would always evince </p><p>an interest in the Cape Horners flying past </p><p>and endeavor to speak them. As home- </p><p>ward-bound deep water clippers are in a </p><p>hurry to get to port, none of them thought </p><p>of backing the maintopsail to “gam" with </p><p>a dirty “spouter.” </p><p> ‘‘Too good a breeze hereabouts for those</p><p>fellows. Captain," I remarked one day, after </p><p>a big dipper with stuns'l out had ignored our </p><p>signal. “We'll have to get down in the </p><p>Variables for speaking ships. Up in the </p><p>Trades they're all for cracking on.” </p><p> “Aye, I reckon so/’ he answered. “I</p><p>want t’ git some stuff for th’ medicine chest </p><p>an’ a little lime-juice. Don't want no scurvy </p><p>t* break out now th fresh meat an’ vegeta- </p><p>bles are done.” </p><p>THUS passed the lazy days. Tack- </p><p>ing to windward for a day; lying to </p><p>at nights, and running down the </p><p>wind at times, we literally became an ocean</p><p>loafer. Whales were conspicuous by their </p><p>absence and I would have welcomed the </p><p>sight of one as eagerly as the oldest whale- </p><p>man aboard. I was becoming heartily tired </p><p>of this dolce far nientc, with nothing to do </p><p>but squint at the sun and wind up a chro- </p><p>nometer. There were no books aboard, </p><p>save what I found in my own room, and to </p><p>while away the time I read the trashy novels </p><p>from cover to cover and even perused the </p><p>dry Sailing Directories and the “Nautical </p><p>Almanac.” </p><p> I had thought of taking Silvera in hand</p><p>and teaching him the use of sextant and </p><p>chronometer, but on second thought I </p><p>dedded that the less he knew about naviga- </p><p>tion the better for me. That he knew noth- </p><p>ing about the science was correct, as I was </p><p>not long in finding out. Though it struck </p><p>me as being rather an unusual thing for the </p><p>master of a deep-sea vessel to be ignorant </p><p>of navigation, yet it was by no means un- </p><p> common in certain trades. In the Pacific,</p><p>I had known island trading vessels in com- </p><p>mand of masters who were not qualified as </p><p>navigators, while many sealers have two </p><p>captains—one as sailing master and the </p><p>other a practical sealer and ice expert. </p><p> l he skipper’s penchant for chasing ves-</p><p>sels was encouraged by me, as I hoped to </p><p>beg some reading matter from the first </p><p>craft that would wait for a boat from us. </p><p>So, when f came on deck one morning and </p><p>found us storming after a big full-rigged </p><p>ship whose upper canvas was just lifting </p><p>above the horizon to the east’ard, I was as </p><p>eager as any one aboard to overhaul her. </p><p>With royals mastheaded we brought the big </p><p>ship broad on the bow before noon, and </p><p>though she had lower and topmast stuns’is </p><p>out, we were overhauling her hand over </p><p>fist. </p><p> “Have a squint at her,” said Silvera,</p><p>handing me the glass. “What d'ye think </p><p>she is?” </p><p> “English ship," I answered, as &gt;o&lt;.n as I</p><p>looked at her. “Australiaman or a tea </p><p>packet from China. She’s a big lump of a </p><p>vessel, but I think we could sail rings round </p><p>her-" </p><p> “Waal, we’ll have a closer look at her</p><p>an’ see ef we kin induce her stubr rn lime- </p><p>juice skipper to back his maintops ii for a </p><p>spell. We’ll go below an’ have dinner now." </p><p> I had never known Silvera to be so pleas-</p><p>ant before. He joked with the officers and </p><p>Kanakas, and laughed heartily over my </p><p>remark that “the homeward - bounders</p><p>would think that the Flying Dutchman had </p><p>shifted his cruising ground by the way we </p><p>were chasing them all.” </p><p> It was a pointless joke, but it evidently</p><p>tickled his fancy immensely. </p><p> “Ha! Ha! Ha! Flyin’ Dutchman!" he</p><p>guffawed. “Great—simply great, Dixon. </p><p>We'll crack a bottle over that, by Godfrey! </p><p>Stoo'ard! Fetch a bottle of rum here.” </p><p>The liquor was brought. I filled my </p><p>glass and drank to his good health. He had </p><p>scarce put his lips to the tumbler before </p><p>Francisco sung out down the companion- </p><p>way: </p><p> “Better come on deck, Cap’en. Hagen</p><p>is took bad with his stomach again-" </p><p> Silvera rose from his seat angrily.</p><p> “Cuss Hagen,” he growled. “Why don't</p><p>he die or git well-” </p><p> As he stepped up the companion he</p><p>turned and spoke to me. </p><p>The Whaler </p><p>57 </p><p> ‘‘You'll excuse me a minute, Dixon.</p><p>Hagen is delirious again, I cal’late. Punish </p><p>th’ bottle. I'll be back, in a minute.” </p><p> The rum was particularly good, and I</p><p>must have punished the bottle, although I </p><p>have no recollection of drinking more than </p><p>two three-finger nips. I remember the </p><p>others getting up from the table and going </p><p>on deck; then a feeling of intense drowsiness </p><p>took possession of me and I staggered over </p><p>to the transom and went to sleep. </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>I OVERHEAR SOME TALK </p><p>** jLTEY, thar! Rouse an’ shine!” </p><p> I was shaken violently, and opened</p><p>by eyes to find Captain Silvera leaning </p><p>over me with his hand on my shoulder. </p><p>There was a smile on his face. </p><p> “Waal, sink me!” he rumbled. “Ef you</p><p>ain’t th’ primest hand for knockin’ out a </p><p>long calk, I don’t know who is. Lord </p><p>Harry, man, ye’ve been on yer beam ends </p><p>for ’most two watches-” </p><p> “Funny thing,” I muttered drowsily.</p><p> “What’s funny?”</p><p>“My sleepin* like this. I’m no Seven </p><p>Sleeper. Must have been that rum-” </p><p> “You jest bet it was,” replied Silvera with</p><p>a laugh. “Cripes, man, ye sat down an’ </p><p>finished th’ whole bottle.” </p><p> “The whole bottle? Why I only remem-</p><p>ber taking two nips-” </p><p> “Infernal big nips, Dixon. Reg’lar sec-</p><p>ond mate’s four-finger whacks, they must </p><p>ha’ bin. Come, turn out an’ have some</p><p>supper.” </p><p> With all the feelings of a man recovering</p><p>from a drinking bout, I rolled off the tran- </p><p>som and soused my aching head in a basin </p><p>of cold water. Then I staggered over to the </p><p>table and sat down to the supper the stew- </p><p>ard had laid out for me. The skipper was </p><p>in his room, but came out and helped him- </p><p>self to a slice of cold beef and a biscuit. </p><p>“Did you get anything from that lime- </p><p>WC werc chasing?” I inquired sleepily. </p><p>“Beggar refused t’ heave to,” replied </p><p>.Silvera “Her skipper told me t’ go to thun- </p><p>’r‘ ” asn t supplyin’ Yankee spouters </p><p>with medicines an’ stores every time they </p><p>nailed for them. Mean sorter swab he was, </p><p>but I had th’ laugh on him jest th’ same.” </p><p>How’s that?” </p><p>Swiped two of his men away from him.” </p><p> “What?” I ejaculated in surprise.</p><p>“Swiped two of his men? How?” </p><p> “They jumped overboard when we ranged</p><p>to wind’ard of him, an’ before old bully th’ </p><p>Britisher c’d git a boat off th' chocks, I </p><p>lowered an’ scoffed them in front o’ his eyes. </p><p>He howled an’ jumped round like a sperm </p><p>bull in a flurry.” </p><p> “Whatever made two members of a home-</p><p>ward-bounder’s crew jump for a Yankee </p><p>whaler?” I questioned doubtingly. </p><p> “They were in trouble with the after</p><p>guard. Some fracas, I reckon, which they </p><p>stood a chanst o’ being jailed for in Eng- </p><p>land. It’s a great joke on Mr. Johnny Bull. </p><p>Now, sir, when you’ve finished, I’d like ye </p><p>t’ shape a course for t’ keep in th’ track o’ </p><p>them Cape Horners. I must git medicines </p><p>an’ limejuice. Hagen is pretty sick an’ </p><p>some o’ th’ crowd for’ard are showin’ signs </p><p>o’ scurvy.” </p><p> I pushed my cup away from me and</p><p>looked at him in some surprise. </p><p> “Why,” I replied wonderingly, “we’re</p><p>right in the sailing track now. All the </p><p>homeward-bound craft from the southard </p><p>plan to cross the Line in twenty-three West </p><p>or thereabouts. But what d'ye want to </p><p>speak north-bound vessels for? Why don’t </p><p>you hail the outward-bounders? </p><p> “Why don’t ye make for the Cape Verde</p><p>Islands? You can get all the fresh vegeta- </p><p>bles, oranges, limes and fresh truck you </p><p>want there, and it’s only a couple of day’s </p><p>sail to the east’ard.” </p><p> And I glanced at him with a vague dis-</p><p>trust in my mind. </p><p> Silvera laughed.</p><p> “My dear Dixon, it’s easy seen that</p><p>you've never been skipper of a whalin’ </p><p>craft. As a marchant sailor it’ll seem queer </p><p>to you, but it’s or'nary enough to us spouter </p><p>men. We never git nawthin’ from the out- </p><p>ward-bounders. They have th’ best part of </p><p>their v’y’ge afore them an’ consequently </p><p>they keep a tight fist on their auti-scorbu- </p><p>tics ’cause they never know how long they’re </p><p>agoin’t’ be box-haulin’ about in the Varia- </p><p>bles north an’ south o’ th’ Line. Th’ home- </p><p>ward craft have a port ’most over their </p><p>bows when they get north o’ twelve latitude </p><p>an’ ef they’ve got potatoes, limejuice, an’ </p><p>sich truck aboard, they'll give it freely </p><p>’cause they’re ’most home. Y’ see?” </p><p> “But why don’t you make the Islands</p><p>and do away with this chasing for to beg </p><p>stores?” </p><p>5^ </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Now, thar’s another thing 'bout whalers</p><p>ye don't know, Dixon. I dursen’t make a </p><p>landfall in a place like Cape Verde, or some </p><p>o’ my bullies ’ull skip out. Some o' them </p><p>are sick o’ th’ v’y’ge already, an’ ef they </p><p>thought St. Vincent was anywheres near, </p><p>them Portygees aboard here ’ud swim ashore </p><p>even ef we lay ten mile off. Now d'ye un- </p><p>derstand?” </p><p> I nodded, and with his plausible explana-</p><p>tions my doubts fled. </p><p> “Well, Captain, just keep her about as</p><p>we are and you’ll raise all the Cape Horn </p><p>fleet, besides the River Platers and the </p><p>Indiamen.” </p><p>NEXT morning I noticed the two </p><p>strangers loafing around the fo’c’s’le </p><p>door with others of our crew. It </p><p>was evident that they had fallen among </p><p>friends by the manner in which the others </p><p>hung around listening to every word they </p><p>were sav ing. However, I did not pay much </p><p>attention to them, though I could hardly </p><p>credit any sailor leaping overboard from a </p><p>homeward-bound Britisher and taking a </p><p>chance of being picked up in a shark- </p><p>infested sea by an American whaling bark. </p><p>The fellows looked tough enough to have </p><p>done anything up to murder, and there was a </p><p>possibility that they had done as Captain </p><p>SDvera had said. </p><p> During the day wre raised the royals of a</p><p>large American ship and we bore away until </p><p>we had him close aboard. Silvera looked at </p><p>the vessel through his binoculars for a long </p><p>time and afterward I saw him conversing </p><p>with one of the new additions to our crew. </p><p>When he came aft he ordered the helmsman</p><p>to come up and we braced the yards and </p><p>swung away without speaking, merely dip- </p><p>ping the ensign. </p><p> “What's the matter with him?’’ I in-</p><p>quired, pointing to the other ship. </p><p> “No good,” answered the skipper.</p><p>“That’s th’ Lillian Cullen. Master’s an old </p><p>shipmate o’ mine an’ I wouldn’t ask him for </p><p>a rope-yarn. He’s a sw'ab.” </p><p> And he walked away.</p><p> “Humph,” I said to myself. “You’re</p><p>infernally particular. Whalers’ ways ain’t </p><p>merchant ways, that’s a certainty. First </p><p>vessel I was ever on that could afford to </p><p>loaf around and pick and choose the craft </p><p>she’ll speak for a bit of stores. ” </p><p> Early next morning, another English</p><p>ship was sighted and given chase to, and </p><p>again our skipper declined to speak her alter </p><p>he had overhauled the vessel. When I </p><p>asked him his reasons he lost liis temper and </p><p>told me to mind my own business. I did so, </p><p>and retired to my bunk to think out a true </p><p>bill for all these peculiar happenings. </p><p> As it was very hot below decks, I opened</p><p>the small square port in the cabin trunk </p><p>to let some air into my room, and while I </p><p>laid ruminating and reflecting over the </p><p>events of the previous weeks I overheard </p><p>the skipper talking with one of the deserters </p><p>from the English ship. The conversation </p><p>was disjointed, but I listened in astonish- </p><p>ment to the words. </p><p> “Ye say John was shippin’ in Melb’u’n</p><p>. . . th’ next ship what had anythin’?” </p><p>The stranger answered: </p><p> “Aye . . . fortnight or so . . . pot o’</p><p>stuff cornin’ down country . . . big Ben- </p><p>digo strike . . . Ballarat ...” </p><p> “Any difficulty . . . signin’ on?”</p><p> “None . . . eighty vessels when I left</p><p>. . . crews cut an’ run for diggin's. Skip- </p><p>per’s payin’ eight pounds a month for </p><p>A. B.’s . . . easy.” </p><p> “What . . . ship’s name?”</p><p> “Yankee built clipper . . . three sky-</p><p>s’lyarder . . . Britisher . . . named Sea . </p><p>. . big ship . . . loaded ...” </p><p> Then I heard my name mentioned by the</p><p>stranger. </p><p>■	“Aye . . . curious beggar . . . Dixon</p><p>. . . navigator . . . fell off jibboom, ye </p><p>say?” </p><p> Silvera’s growling voice replied and I</p><p>strained my ears. </p><p> “Yes . . . hard job . . . hocused him</p><p>. . . bottle . . . rum . . . knows naw- </p><p>thin’.”</p><p> And they moved away.</p><p> “Hocused? Bottle of rum?” I mut-</p><p>tered. “Humph! That’s why I slept so </p><p>hard. There’s something mighty fishy </p><p>aboard this packet.” And I set my wits to </p><p>work. </p><p> Why should I have been drugged? W’hat</p><p>happened to make Silvera remove me from </p><p>the scene for a space? How comes he to be </p><p>so familiar with a runaway sailor from an </p><p>English ship? What had he to do with </p><p>“John” who was “shipping in Melbourne?” </p><p>What had the Yankee-built clipper Sea- </p><p>Something-or-Other to do with a whaling </p><p>bark or Silvera himself? W’hy should I be </p><p>the subject of discussion between my skip- </p><p>per and a runaway stranger? </p><p>The Whaler </p><p>59 </p><p> I asked myself these questions a hundred</p><p>times and failed to find a possible solution. </p><p>All morning I remained in my berth turning </p><p>the problems over in my mind until my </p><p>brain boiled, and when I went on deck to </p><p>take a moon sight, I made a resolution to </p><p>keep my weather eye lifting for squalls. </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p> THE ARCTURUS HAULS BY THE WIND</p><p>R several days the skipper never </p><p>spoke to me. Then all at once he be- </p><p>came affable and friendly, even making me </p><p>a present of some of his favorite cigars. I </p><p>felt he had something up his sleeve and I </p><p>kept on my guard for new developments. </p><p>We had been yarning away for a while when </p><p>he inquired suddenly— </p><p> “Are you religious?”</p><p> “Religious?” I reiterated. “Well, that’s a</p><p>hard question to answer. I’ve got as much </p><p>religion as most sailormen have a chance to </p><p>get, but I'm no devil-dodger by any manner </p><p>of means. I’ve lived pretty square though, </p><p>and done my best for a shipmate-” </p><p> “Humph!”</p><p> He interrupted with a grunt and con-</p><p>tinued pacing the quarter. </p><p> “Did you ever kill a man?” was his next</p><p>query. </p><p> “No,” I replied decisively, “and I hope</p><p>I never will.” </p><p> “Ever been in th’ live ebony trade? Ever</p><p>been privateerin’?” </p><p> “No, sir,” I answered. “But I’ve been</p><p>blockade running.” </p><p> He seemed to think very little of that</p><p>and resumed his pacing. </p><p> "Looky here,” he continued, pausing in</p><p>his three steps and a turn. “Ef you got a</p><p>chanst to make a pile of dollars easily would </p><p>you be particular as to how ve got it? Espe- </p><p>cially ef nobody ’ud ever know or find out? </p><p>A pile of dollars, mind—a fortune enough </p><p>to low ye to retire an’ live at ease for th’ </p><p>rest of yer days. Eh?” </p><p> That altogether depends, Captain. I’m</p><p>open to grab all I can get, but I’d like to </p><p>know how it’s to be done first.” </p><p> Say piracy—lootin’ vessels,” returned</p><p>he^stanng JHto my face with a steady gaze. </p><p>., ' -Piracy?’ I gasped. “Lord, man, but </p><p>that s a terrible thing, and means the gal- </p><p>lows if caught. Besides, it means mur- </p><p>der-” </p><p> A fearful thought flashed into my mind,</p><p>and he must have noticed the terror in my </p><p>eyes. </p><p> “Pah, man!” he said with a half laugh.</p><p>“You must think I’m a second Cap’en </p><p>Kidd. I don’t mean this throat-cuttin’ </p><p>business: black flag, walkin’ planks an’ </p><p>that sorter guff. I hev a little bit o’ a </p><p>scheme for borryin’ stores from them passin ’ </p><p>vessels an’ sellin’ them down south in th’ </p><p>Falklands. Ye see, while we're cruisin’ on </p><p>these grounds we kin be askin’ passin’ ves- </p><p>sels for barrels o’ flour, pork, beef an’ sich- </p><p>like-” </p><p> He paused with a sheepish smile on his</p><p>face, while I almost burst out laughing. </p><p>What a mean, cadging schemer he was! </p><p>And this was his piracy? Holy sailor! </p><p>I had met stingy skippers in my day, but </p><p>this whaleman had them all hull dov.n. So </p><p>this was his little game! This explained </p><p>his chasing of ships! Begging for stores to </p><p>sell on his own account! </p><p> “You can count me in. Captain.” I an-</p><p>swered heartily. “I don’t mind if that’s </p><p>the game-” </p><p> “Sure! That’s what I was a drivin' at, but</p><p>I didn't know how ve’d look at the idea." </p><p> “Caramba1 I don’t care a hang. My</p><p>conscience don’t bother me on that score. </p><p>We’ll hail every ship in sight, and take all </p><p>we can get.” </p><p> He laughed pleasantly and walked away</p><p>for’ard. </p><p>'“Wrhat a game!’’ I ruminated, but as I </p><p>turned his conversation over in my mind I </p><p>began to think I was more of a fool than he </p><p>was. What pile of dollars was to be made </p><p>out of a few barrels of stores? Why should </p><p>he ask me if I’d ever killed a man? I was </p><p>beginning to get horribly tangled up in my </p><p>thoughts, and as I was not particularly </p><p>quick-witted. I judged I had better go below</p><p>and in the privacy of my berth overhaul my </p><p>experiences from the hour I was thrown </p><p>aboard the A rclurus. </p><p> I went over events from the time I was</p><p>threatened with a long swim, and then came </p><p>the memory of the bottle of rum; chasing </p><p>the English ship and the two supposed </p><p>strangers who came aboard mysteriously </p><p>while I laid in a drugged slumber; the dis- </p><p>jointed conversation I had overheard, and </p><p>now this farcical conversation with its pre- </p><p>posterous and picayune suggestion. Silvera </p><p>to make a “fortune” by such a petty scheme! </p><p>Pah! It was unheard of! </p><p>6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>WHILE I scratched my thick down- </p><p>east head in perplexity, a hail from </p><p>aloft came to my ears. </p><p> “Vessel down to loo’ard, sir!”</p><p> I rolled out and pulled on my boots.</p><p>"Must go and see Silvera cadging his </p><p>stores,” 1 muttered. </p><p> When 1 went on deck it was to see him</p><p>and one of the deserters aloft in the hoops </p><p>on the fore and main scanning the upper </p><p>sails of a ship which gleamed like tiny pearls </p><p>above the blue of the sea line. When he </p><p>came down, he gave me 3 knowing wink </p><p>and passed the usual order to bear down. </p><p> “We’ll borry somethin’ from this packet,</p><p>I hope,” he said softly. "Big ship—three </p><p>skys’l-yarder.” </p><p> I remained on deck for over an hour,</p><p>until the other vessel hove her hull up above </p><p>the horizon. She was a big ship, deep- </p><p>laden, and carrying double topsails, single </p><p>topgallants, royals, and skysails on each </p><p>mast. There was a fresh breeze blowing and </p><p>with all our own kites set and drawing, our </p><p>little clipper bark sped rapidly through </p><p>the water in the direction of the stranger. </p><p> It was about four in the afternoon when I</p><p>went below to get a drink from the rack in </p><p>the saloon. The skipper met me as I </p><p>stepped down the ladder. </p><p> “Where are ye goin’?” he inquired.</p><p>“Just to get a drink of water,” I replied. </p><p>“Oh,” he muttered, and he stepped on </p><p>deck as I went over to the table. </p><p> The steward was coming out of my room</p><p>just as I lifted the water bottle from the </p><p>rack and found it empty. He looked across </p><p>at me quickly. </p><p> “Water, sir? You’ll find some fresh from</p><p>the tank in your room, sir. I’ll fill that one </p><p>in a minute.” </p><p> He reached over for the bottle and I</p><p>handed it to him. </p><p> Entering my room I closed the door.</p><p>“Now,” I said to myself, “here’s where I </p><p>get my bearings. Steward is a liar, for he </p><p>filled my water bottle this morning before </p><p>I turned out.” </p><p> I reached for the article and was just in time</p><p>to see the last grains of a whitish powder </p><p>effervescing into nothingness in the bottom. </p><p> “Just what I expected,” thought I. “The</p><p>rum bottle won’t work twice, but the water </p><p>bottle will. Humph!” </p><p> With a plan of action mapped out, I</p><p>poured the water out into a tumbler and </p><p>thence into the wash bucket. Then I threw </p><p>myself down on my bunk and awaited de- </p><p>velopments. </p><p> I must have been lying some twenty min-</p><p>utes when 1 heard stealthy footsteps ap- </p><p>proach my door and some one tapped </p><p>lightly. </p><p> “Mr. Dixon!”</p><p> It was the steward's voice. I shut my</p><p>eyes and snored. </p><p> “Mr. Dixon!" came the voice again, and</p><p>the door was quietly opened and the man </p><p>entered the room. 1 had my back turned to </p><p>him, but I could almost |sense everything </p><p>he did, even to picking up the tumbler and </p><p>examining it. After bending over me he </p><p>left the room and closed the door. </p><p> “So much for him,” I murmured when he</p><p>had departed. Glancing out of the square </p><p>port above my bunk 1 could see the big </p><p>skysail-yarder coming up to leeward. Fear- </p><p>ing lest I should be seen staring through the </p><p>small window I half drew the curtain and </p><p>lay down again. </p><p> Once more heavy footsteps approached</p><p>my door and a voice boomed. </p><p> “Dixon! Dixon!”</p><p> It was Silvera, but I made no answer.</p><p>Then he looked in on me and I heard him </p><p>say to the steward who was in the cabin: </p><p> “He’s out of th’ way for a Jong spell f</p><p>he drank a tumbler o’ that water. Look in </p><p>on him now an’ again.” </p><p> And the door was closed quietly.</p><p>THERE was a great deal of tramp- </p><p>ing overhead. 1 felt that all hands </p><p>were out and preparing for some- </p><p>thing by the scurrying of booted feet w-hich </p><p>resounded on the deck above me. Silvera </p><p>was at the poop rail, singing out orders. </p><p> “Check in weather braces! Square the</p><p>yards . . . Git your engine set up, Camer- </p><p>on .. . Whalin’ gear out o’ boats . . . </p><p>Stand by.”</p><p> I glanced through my port, but could see</p><p>nothing but a portion of the quarter rail </p><p>and the empty sunlit sea. </p><p> “Now, Fernandez!” came the skipper s</p><p>strident voice. “Got that Brazilian ens n </p><p>bent? Ease down yer helm. . . . Slack </p><p>away weather, haul taut lee braces..... </p><p>Haul up on yer mains’l. . . . Haul up yer </p><p>fores’1. . . . Smartly, men!” </p><p> “Hauling by the wind,” I murmured.</p><p> As the bark heeled over with the pres-</p><p>sure, I took another look through my port </p><p>and saw the strange ship close aboard. She </p><p>I </p><p>The Whaler </p><p>61 </p><p>was a big two-thousand-tonner at least, </p><p>with built lowermasts and long spars. </p><p> “American built ship loaded with Aus-</p><p>tralian wool for England," was my mental </p><p>comment. What a magnificent picture she </p><p>made with her snowy cotton duck canvas </p><p>full and drawing, and her long black hull </p><p>slipping through the blue water with a line </p><p>of foam streaming aft from her beautiful </p><p>clipper bow! </p><p> I could make out the officer walking</p><p>the weather side of her long quarter; see </p><p>the passengers she carried standing upon the </p><p>coach-house staring at us; see, too, the </p><p>crew's heads peering over the rail for’ard </p><p>and a man in a red shirt sitting astride of the </p><p>martingale stays under the bowsprit—evi- </p><p>dently spearing dolphin, for he had a four- </p><p>pronged grain in his hand. My attention </p><p>was suddenly arrested by the actions of </p><p>this fellow when he commenced waving his </p><p>neckerchief in a peculiar manner. A voice </p><p>sounded close above me. </p><p> “There’s John, Cap’en. D’ye see him</p><p>hangin’ to th' martingale an’ wavin’-” </p><p> Startled, I glanced at the clipper’s name</p><p>board on the quarter rail and read, Sea King. </p><p> “Sea King . . . Three skys’I-yarder . . .</p><p>Melbourne . . . John?” I muttered, and </p><p>I felt that something was going to happen </p><p>which would materially clear the fogginess </p><p>of my mind and elucidate the mystery </p><p>of the whaling bark Arcturus and her pe- </p><p>culiar skipper. </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>I QUOTE FROM MY LOG </p><p>‘ VTW'HAT ship is that?” came a faint hail </p><p> *	* from the clipper ship.</p><p> “Brazilian trainin’ frigate Arcturus!”</p><p>thundered Silvera. </p><p> “Brazilian frigate be blowed!” came from</p><p>the other, and the voice continued:</p><p> “Sheer off now! D’ye want to run us</p><p>down?” </p><p> The Sea King's lower sails were ashiver.</p><p>owing to our stopping up the wind. As we </p><p>were jammed up to windward, we could not </p><p>bear away without coming down on the </p><p>other ship, and I could hear the officers on </p><p>the Australiaman cursing at us as they put </p><p>their helm up to get clear of us. </p><p> “You confounded Yankee spouter!”</p><p>bawled a little red-faced man shaking liis </p><p>list at us. What in blazes d ye mean?” </p><p> I could hear Silvera laughing.</p><p> “Slap it into him, Cameron!’’ he cried.</p><p>“Wheelhouse, mind!” </p><p> Bang! There came a detonation ^vhich</p><p>caused the Arcturus to shake in even- plank, </p><p>and as I stared in consternation through the </p><p>port, I saw the Sea King's wheelhouse liter- </p><p>ally swept from the deck in a crumple of </p><p>splinters—wheel-gear, helmsman and the </p><p>wooden house knocked clean over the lee </p><p>quarter. Fascinated by the suddenness and </p><p>horror of the action, I kept my gaze fixed on </p><p>the now* unmanageable clipper; heard the </p><p>shouts of fear and rage which came from her </p><p>people, and saw' the panic-stricken crew </p><p>running about on her decks. An officer ran </p><p>to her break rail shouting: </p><p> “Haul aft your weather head sheets!</p><p>Slack away lee braces-” </p><p> “Sweep th’ quarter, Cameron!” roared</p><p>Silvera excitedly. “Don’t give ’em a chance </p><p>to wear ship or they'll run away from </p><p>us-” </p><p> jBang! Another explosion, and a wild yell</p><p>from our crew as the shot smashed across </p><p>the cabin trunk, tearing skylights, com- </p><p>panionway, and chart-house into a shov. er of </p><p>splinters and clearing the poop of all living </p><p>creatures. </p><p> “Give ’em another, Cameron. Bring</p><p>that mainm’st down ef you can. Look out </p><p>for John.” </p><p> John—the man in the red shirt—was still</p><p>astride the martingale and safe enough if </p><p>he stayed where he was. </p><p> Before the third shot was fired, I heard</p><p>footsteps approaching my room, and I had </p><p>just time to fall back on my blankets and </p><p>commence snoring when some one looked </p><p>in on me. The gun spoke again, but I con- </p><p>trolled my nerves so that I made no move- </p><p>ment. </p><p> “Dead to th’ world,’’ muttered the in-</p><p>truder, and the door was closed quietly. </p><p>Wrhen I stared through the port once more, </p><p>it was to see the clipper ship lazily drifting</p><p>to leeward with yards abaci; and sails slat- </p><p>ting. The third shot had torn a great gap </p><p>in the bulwarks amidships, but the main- </p><p>mast was still standing. </p><p> “Lower away yer boats!” commanded</p><p>Silvera sharply. “Fernandez! Take charge </p><p>and work down to loo’ard an’ pick us up </p><p>when we’re ready.” </p><p> I shall quote from my log as to what</p><p>happened next, as I consider it requires no </p><p>elaboration: </p><p>62 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Four boats towered. Six men in cach. AU armed</p><p>with cutlases and firearms. Captain Silvera in </p><p>leading boat. Two boats ranged to starboard and </p><p>two to port of Sea King. Crew made fast to main </p><p>chains and scrambled aboard, leaving one man in </p><p>boat.	/</p><p> Whalemen went aft in company with man in</p><p>red shirt. A show of resistance was made by Sea </p><p>Kings officers. Some shots lired and ship's people </p><p>driven forward and locked in fo'c's'le. </p><p> Numerous boxes were fetched out of cabin and</p><p>lowered carefully into boats. All boats returned </p><p>within half an hour to our vessel. Man in red shirt </p><p>coming off with Silvera. </p><p> Time, 6 p. m., January 21, 1867. Latitude,</p><p>140 10' North. Longitude 310 6' West. 780 miles </p><p>east of Cape Verde. </p><p>IT WAS piracy—nothing more and </p><p>nothing less. Horrified by the events </p><p>I had witnessed, I laid back on my </p><p>pillow, while the crew hoisted their boats </p><p>and booty aboard. A number of men </p><p>came down into the cabin and I was </p><p>conscious that Silvera was among them. </p><p>Snatches of their conversation fell upon my </p><p>ears. Our villainous Portuguese Yankee </p><p>skipper was giving orders. </p><p> “Yes! stow th’ stuff in th’ lazareet. . . .</p><p>No! he’s sure for another six hours yet. . . . </p><p>Won’t know anything. Easy now. Heavy, </p><p>eh? ... A great haul. ...” </p><p> “Holy sailor. Cap, but I was afraid ye’d</p><p>never show up," an unfamiliar voice was </p><p>saying. “I’ve hardly slept a wink sence we </p><p>crossed th’ Line. You picked up Billy all </p><p>right. . . . Good haul. Waal, I cal’late </p><p>that’ll finish us now, an’ I’m cussed glad. </p><p>What’s yer plans for that joker t’ windward? </p><p>Soon be dark. . . . Better hurry.” </p><p> The shuffling feet left the cabin and</p><p>there was a scurrying about on deck. The </p><p>Sea King was lying on our starboard side and </p><p>I was unable to see her from my window. </p><p> “All right, Cameron,” sung out the skip-</p><p>per. “Plant one amidships. Look sharp or</p><p>it’ll be dark.” </p><p> The boom of the gun came to my ears, and</p><p>I realized what the fiends were doing. They </p><p>were sinking their victim! </p><p> I saw through every tiling now. As I lay</p><p>with the clammy sweat breaking out on my </p><p>face, the mysterious actions of the past two </p><p>months unfolded themselves before my men- </p><p>tal vision, and the scales fell from my eyes. </p><p>Nineteenth-century pirates masquerading </p><p>in the guise of whalers! It seemed impossi- </p><p>ble and improbable, but what else would </p><p>account for the events and things 1 had seen </p><p>and heard? The patrolling of the sailing </p><p>tracks; the chasing of many ships upon triv- </p><p>ial pretenses; the nature of our crew, and </p><p>the skipper’s peculiar conversations. Two </p><p>vessels had been looted—I had no doubt </p><p>whatever that the ship we chased when I </p><p>was drugged had been despatched in a man- </p><p>ner similar lo the Sea King—and upon both </p><p>ships were confederates who in some mys- </p><p>terious manner had means of communi- </p><p>cating with Silvera. </p><p> How was it all arranged? Both ships were</p><p>Australiamen homeward bound. The con- </p><p>versation of Silvera and the stranger came </p><p>to mind: </p><p> “Bendigo,” “Ballarat,” “pot o’ stuff</p><p>coming’ down country,” he had said. </p><p> What stuff? It was as plain as a dead-</p><p>eye to me now. Bendigo and Ballarat, the </p><p>new Victoria goldfielcls where everybody </p><p>was flocking to. The “stuff,” gold! </p><p> Bang! The gun spoke again, and changed</p><p>the tenor of my thoughts. What would </p><p>happen to me? It was a disturb - ig ques- </p><p>tion, and I realized my helplessness. Could </p><p>Silvera do without my services? I couldn’t </p><p>answer. It was a deuce of a position for a </p><p>man to be in, but after a vast amount of </p><p>brain-racking, I concluded that the less I </p><p>pretended to know about what had hap- </p><p>pened the better for me. If Silvera thought </p><p>that I suspected his game, I had absolutely </p><p>no doubt but what I would be given a toss </p><p>to the sharks. Men of Silvera’s type had no </p><p>compunctions. I knew that already. </p><p> My action after this may seem strange,</p><p>but you must remember the state of mind I </p><p>was in. I had been an eyewitness of an </p><p>act of piracy on the high seas. I was among </p><p>a crowd of suspicious cutthroats who </p><p>wished me to know nothing; a ship and her </p><p>human freight was being sunk alongside, </p><p>and I was supposed to be oblivious to it all </p><p>in a drugged slumber. To calm my nerves </p><p>and add realism to my feigned sleep, I</p><p>poured out a small drink from the water </p><p>bottle and tossed it off. Within a minute </p><p>I could feel the drug working its soporific </p><p>influence. I had a faint recollection of </p><p>hearing the boom of the gun again, and </p><p>then I lost consciousness. </p><p>CHAPTER VIII </p><p>I CARRY OUT A PLAN </p><p>T AWOKE naturally and saw that it </p><p>was daylight. The steward was setting </p><p>the breakfast on the cabin table, and feeling </p><p>as if I had passed a nightmarish sleep, 1 </p><p>The Whaler </p><p>63 </p><p>turned out, washed and went on deck. </p><p>The steward looked sharply at me as I </p><p>passed, but his “Good morning, sir!” was </p><p>as civil as usual. </p><p> The skipper was pacing the trunk deck</p><p>when I came up the companion, and he </p><p>hailed me with a laugh. </p><p> “By th’ great horse-block!” he cried.</p><p>“Have ye really woke up? Caramba I I </p><p>thought ye were in a trance by th’ way ye </p><p>snored. Th’ second mate said he c’d hear </p><p>ye up on deck here. Cripes, man, but you’re </p><p>a heavy sleeper.” </p><p> I gave a sickly grin, and he stepped</p><p>towards me. </p><p> “Run up ag’in’ another hard case yester-</p><p>day,” he said softly. “That skys’l-yarder </p><p>was another screw. Said he wanted me t’ </p><p>pay for all th’ stuff I got, so I swung off. </p><p>My scheme’s no good, Dixon, so we’ll get </p><p>down to huntin’ whale again. When ye’ve </p><p>fixed up th’ reck’nin’ I’ll ask ye t’ drive her </p><p>south. Thar ain’t no fish hereabouts, so </p><p>we’ll make th’ Pacific an’ try th’ Line </p><p>grounds thar. South we go, an’ ho, for th’ </p><p>stormy Horn!” </p><p> I placed our position and give the course</p><p>for the Line. The bark had been lying to </p><p>the wind all night with fore and main royals </p><p>and topgallantsails furled, and when I gave </p><p>Silvera the course, he sung out to the watch </p><p>loafing for’ard: </p><p> “Swing th’ mainyard! Make sail!”</p><p> To the second mate pacing to leeward he</p><p>said: </p><p> “Get the muslin on her, Mr. Fernandez.</p><p>We’ve a long stretch to make an’ we don’t </p><p>want to be all year makin’ it. Rouse out yer </p><p>stu’n’s’l gear. Get th’ booms out an* set </p><p>lower an’ topm’st stu’n’s’ls to port. Clew </p><p>up th’ maintack an’ sheet everything well </p><p>down. This little barky is goin’t’ sail now!” </p><p>Among the men hurrying around to exe- </p><p>cute the orders I noticed the fellow in the</p><p>red shirt: and helping to break out the </p><p>booms and stu’n’s'lyards lashed on top of the </p><p>for’ard house was Hagen, the sick man, look- </p><p>ing as fit as he ever was. Yet Silvera had </p><p>said he was delirious and dying! </p><p>DURING the weeks which passed </p><p>on our run to the south’ard. the skip- </p><p>per treated me with every courtesy, </p><p>and I guarded my emotions so well that he </p><p>never suspected for a: moment that I was </p><p>aware of the crimes which he and his crew </p><p>had committed. Lideed, things were so </p><p>monotonous and usual, that I began to doubt </p><p>myself; the whole affair seemed but a vivid </p><p>dream. </p><p> Though I hunted around for proofs to</p><p>substantiate my suspicions, yet absolutely </p><p>nothing could I find. No trace was there </p><p>of any gun aboard, nor did I ever run across </p><p>any weapons other than a shotgun in Sil- </p><p>vera’s room. I knew that the officers had </p><p>revolvers—most officers have—but rifles, </p><p>cutlases, cannon and shells were conspicu- </p><p>ous by their absence. </p><p> As I was not an officer of the ship I had</p><p>no right to go prying around the vessel, but </p><p>on the occasional strolls I made to the fo’- </p><p>c’s’le head I found nothing to characterize </p><p>the Ardurus as being anything but what she </p><p>was—a whaling bark bound on her lawful </p><p>occasions with a perfect right to cruise </p><p>wherever she listed in pursuit of the ceta- </p><p>ceans. I might, have got substantial proof </p><p>if I could examine the lazaretto, yet I knew </p><p>that any attempt on my part would mean </p><p>sudden death. I did not try. </p><p> We passed the East Falklands after a</p><p>fine run down, and we crossed Burdwood's </p><p>Bank to edge up to the stormy comer of the </p><p>southern world. The weather was fine for </p><p>the high latitudes—fresh sou’westerly wind </p><p>and a smooth sea—and with royals furled we </p><p>swashed on our lonely way. I had been </p><p>asleep all afternoon on the third day after </p><p>passing the Falklands, and in my stocking </p><p>feet I ascended the companion for a breath </p><p>of fresh air. The night was black dark. </p><p>Filling my pipe in the gangway, I stepped </p><p>on deck intending to ask the watch officer </p><p>for a match. As I passed along the lee </p><p>alley towards the break rail. I heard my </p><p>name mentioned by some one over to wind- </p><p>ward, and stopped to listen. </p><p> With the sough of the wind and the wash</p><p>from our passage through the water, the </p><p>conversationalists were obliged to speak </p><p>loudly, and being to leeward I caught the </p><p>words distinctly.</p><p> “Get him out o' th’ way after we make the</p><p>Island. . . . We don’t want him after that. </p><p>. . . Need good navigator to pick it up. </p><p>. . . Afterwards I can take her to 'Frisco. </p><p>. . . Think Dixon knows anything?” </p><p> It was Slocum’s voice—he of the red</p><p>shirt—and he was talking to Silvera. </p><p> “Nawthin’ . . . Doped out both times.</p><p>. . . Albemarle . . . Sea King. Get him </p><p>to fetch us to Hiva Nuku. . . . Jake </p><p>Thompson’ll have his schooner there an' </p><p>64 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>we’ll ship th’ stuff. . . . Give his a toss to </p><p>th’ sharks. ..." </p><p>FEARFUL of being discovered, I </p><p>crept away with the hair of my head </p><p>tingling. So that was the lay! I </p><p>wras to be used for my navigating abilities </p><p>in picking up some Pacific Island rendez- </p><p>vous and then cast adrift like a worn-out </p><p>swab. Red Shirt would navigate the bark </p><p>to San Francisco—any one who could steer </p><p>and keep track of a log could do that; but </p><p>picking up some isolated Pacific atoll re- </p><p>quired more accurate knowledge. </p><p> Slipping quietly into my room, I lit my</p><p>pipe and turned into my bunk to think </p><p>things out. A number of schemes came to </p><p>my mind, but I dismissed them all as im- </p><p>probable and impossible. I had no friends </p><p>among the crew whom I could rely upon. </p><p>All were deep in the scheme and none would </p><p>act against Silvera. Joe Smith, my former </p><p>shipmate of the blockade days, had never </p><p>spoken a word to me since the eventful </p><p>night I fell aboard the bark, and I knew I </p><p>could expect nothing from him. </p><p> Escape was impossible. If I attempted to</p><p>swim to a passing ship I would be shot or </p><p>quickly recaptured, and the chances of </p><p>swimming in the icy seas of the Southern </p><p>Ocean were not feasible. I couldn’t launch </p><p>a boat without some one seeing or hearing </p><p>me. I had to dismiss that. I had no weap- </p><p>ons other than a sheath-knife, and even if I </p><p>had a revolver, what could I do with it? </p><p>Shoot Silvera and a few others, maybe, but </p><p>it would not be long before I would be killed </p><p>myself. No, I had to admit that my chances </p><p>were mighty slim. </p><p> I reached down a chart of Cape Horn and</p><p>the Straits of Magellan and studied it for a </p><p>moment, and I remembered how, that very </p><p>morning I had to explain to Silvera the </p><p>great easterly variation which prevailed in </p><p>the vicinity. He had questioned me with </p><p>regard to the amount of wasting in the</p><p>course I had given him; in his ignorance he </p><p>had reckoned when steering south, the </p><p>course should necessarily be south, varia- </p><p>tion, deviation and other errors of the com- </p><p>pass being a mystery to him. </p><p> It w’as the easterly variation which gave</p><p>me the idea. Desperate and all as it was, </p><p>I decided that it was the only thing I could </p><p>do. If I were destined to die, then I would </p><p>take good care that others went with me. </p><p>Briefly, I determined that 1 w'ould put </p><p>the Arcturus ashore on one or other of the </p><p>dangerous rocks which fringed the Horn! </p><p> 1 lay awake the best part of the night,</p><p>smoking and thinking. At da s light I </p><p>slipped into my pocket a steel watchchain </p><p>I had found in the desk and went on deck. </p><p>Francisco, the watch officer, was lolling </p><p>over the break rail for’ard, and a stupid </p><p>Chileno was at the wheel. Going over to </p><p>the compass 1 told him to steer by the </p><p>weather leach of the mainto’gallan’s’i for a </p><p>minute. Standing in front of him, I took </p><p>off the binnacle hood, noted the point at the </p><p>lubber mark on the compass, and after </p><p>slipping the steel chain under the right </p><p>side of the card I placed the cover on </p><p>again. </p><p> “All right,” I growled to the helmsman.</p><p>“Keep her as she w'as.” </p><p> And I left him pulling the spokes over to</p><p>head up on the vast amount of westing I </p><p>had introduced into the compass. </p><p> “Now!” I muttered. “I'll play a little</p><p>game of my own, Captain Silvera, and we !! </p><p>see who wins out—you or me. If I can’t </p><p>pile you up inside of twenty-four hour; then </p><p>I’m a Dutchman.” </p><p> At noon I got a sight, and fixed our posi-</p><p>tion as some eighty miles northwest of </p><p>Staten Island. There was a fresh breeze </p><p>blowing and we were logging seven to eight </p><p>knots with a southerly wind. We were sail- </p><p>ing close-hauled, heading about W. S. W. </p><p>by correct compass course, but in reality </p><p>the bark was actually making that course, </p><p>as my steel chain more than compensated </p><p>for the easterly variation. </p><p> “Now, sir,” I said to the skipper, after I</p><p>had shown him our position on the chart, </p><p>“we’ll be opening out the Horn by daylight </p><p>and we’re feeling the set of the South Drift </p><p>now. Crack on and make the most of this </p><p>breeze. We’ve plenty of sea room to clear </p><p>Cape St. John and w*e w'ant to make all the </p><p>westing we can while the wind holds.” </p><p> He nodded curtly. When he went on</p><p>deck, I heard him singing out for the fore</p><p>and main royals, topmast staysails and </p><p>gaff-topsail to be set. </p><p> “Now,” said I to myself, “slam away,</p><p>you bloody-minded pirate! Four bells in </p><p>the first watch'll have us trying to push </p><p>Staten Island out of the water and a grand </p><p>Ice shore the cliffs will make with this </p><p>souther blowing. There are no lights in </p><p>this part of the world and there’s sure to be </p><p>fog inshore, and it’s a safe bet that no </p><p>The Whaler </p><p>65 </p><p>lookout will ever report land until the </p><p>breakers are heard.” </p><p> THE afternoon seemed intermina-</p><p>bly long, and as it was Summertime </p><p>down south, the night came tardily </p><p>over the waste of rolling gray sea and </p><p>grayer sky. I paced the quarter, smoking, </p><p>until nine o’clock. Looking over the log </p><p>slate in the chart-house, I made a mental </p><p>calculation of our position as being about </p><p>fifteen miles off the land. The breeze still </p><p>held strong and the vessel was storming </p><p>steadily on the course I had laid for her. </p><p>Within two hours she would strike. </p><p> I glanced around the ship, heard the</p><p>growling talk of the watch mustered aft in </p><p>the lee of the half deck, smoking and yarn- </p><p>ing; heard a ribald chorus come from the </p><p>fo’c’s'le, and saw Fernandez steadily pacing </p><p>the weather alley. Silvera was below asleep. </p><p>The harpooners were playing cards in the </p><p>half deck. A shivering negro tugged with </p><p>mittened hands at the spokes of the wheel. </p><p> All were oblivious to impending disaster.</p><p>But they deserved the fate I had in store </p><p>for them, and when I felt my nerve waver- </p><p>ing, I thought of the murdered crews of the </p><p>Albemarle and Sea King. Aye! I could </p><p>save my sympathy. </p><p> I went below and locked myself in my</p><p>room. Sitting on the transom I made a </p><p>mental overhaul of my life, and, finding </p><p>the slate fairly clean, waited calmly for </p><p>the crash which meant the end. </p><p>CHAPTER DC </p><p> SILVERA AND I ARE QUITS</p><p>HTHE reader of this narrative will proba- </p><p>A bly think I was extremely phlegmatic </p><p>in my desperate actions. I was. Life held </p><p>very little for me then. I had no home and </p><p>no relations, no friends except an odd ship- </p><p>mate here and there. I held a master’s cer- </p><p>tificate, but hard times and hard experi- </p><p>ences had practically killed all my ambition, </p><p>and I hated the life I was living; hated the </p><p>sea; hated everything. Existence for me</p><p>had by now developed into a mere pro- </p><p>longation of life by eating and drinking. </p><p>Scheming and planning had jaded my brain, </p><p>and I was quite prepared to die if I could be </p><p>sure of blotting out the horde of scoundrels </p><p>I was shipmates with. God would give me </p><p>credit for that, I was sure. </p><p>6 </p><p> Therefore it was with an easy conscience</p><p>that I waited for the inevitable, and with- </p><p>out any nervousness I turned into my </p><p>bunk. When the bark struck, I would re- </p><p>main where I was. Just as easy to die below </p><p>decks as to be engulfed and tossed about in </p><p>the open. </p><p> I must have fallen into an apathetic doze,</p><p>for when I awoke it was to hear Femande2 </p><p>scream inarticulate words down the com- </p><p>panionway. The quietness of the night was </p><p>broken by a sonorous booming. When a </p><p>medley of shouts and running feet sounded </p><p>overhead, I knew we wTere in the breakers. </p><p>I felt the bark staggering and lurching, </p><p>heard the steward open his door and clatter </p><p>up the ladder, and Silvera roaring and </p><p>swearing. </p><p> Some one shrieked, “Hard down! Hard</p><p>down!” and then came a frightful shock. </p><p> I was hurled bodily to the floor. I made</p><p>no attempt to rise, but lay where I fell, </p><p>listening to the thunder of the waves </p><p>breaching over the vessel and the hoarse </p><p>shouts of the panic-stricken crew. The </p><p>bark was lifting and pounding with dreadful </p><p>concussions upon the rock or ledge, and </p><p>amidst the din of falling spars, rending </p><p>woodwork and crashing seas, the voice of </p><p>Silvera could be heard directing the launch- </p><p>ing of a boat with frightful oaths. </p><p> All hands seemed to have swarmed aft</p><p>on to the poop. I could hear the stamping </p><p>and shuffling of their booted feet on the deck </p><p>above me; their yells and curves, and the </p><p>boom and crash of the boarding breakers. </p><p>Then I remember Slocum bawling some- </p><p>thing about “dead wall of rock ahead” and </p><p>“drop off jibboom.” There was more </p><p>stamping of the booted feet, and some one </p><p>clattered down the companion ladder. </p><p> “Dixon,you swine! Ahoy, Dixon! Where</p><p>are you, you dog! Bum my soul, but I’ll </p><p>cut yer heart out!” and a string of vile </p><p>oaths. </p><p> It was Silvera. I made no answer. He</p><p>groped about in the darkness until he came </p><p>to my door. He tried the handle. Finding </p><p>it locked, he roared: </p><p> “Open th’ door, you--! You’ve</p><p>spiked me, but by - I'll spike youl </p><p>Open!” </p><p> Receiving no answer, he hammered on</p><p>the panels with his fists, snarling like a dog </p><p>and swearing dreadfully. The vessel shud- </p><p>dered to the shocks of the waves breaking </p><p>over her. Then came a resounding crash </p><p>66 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>on the deck above, with a splintering and </p><p>tearing of woodwork; and a roaring welter </p><p>of sea came like a cataract into the cabin. </p><p>The water was spurting into my room </p><p>through the cracks in the door. I expected </p><p>that the end was coming. Silvera was still </p><p>in the cabin, but he had desisted from his </p><p>endeavor to force an entrance to my room. </p><p>I expect he thought I was dead. </p><p>THE water was swashing over my </p><p>body with every pound of the vessel, </p><p>when she suddenly canted to star- </p><p>board and I was thrown violently against </p><p>the bulkhead. As my room was to port </p><p>the water drained out, and I found myself </p><p>lying on the wet planking and still very </p><p>much alive. Instead of wishing to die, a </p><p>desire to live was beginning to take pos- </p><p>session of me, and I rose to my feet. </p><p> The vessel was not pounding now, and</p><p>though she trembled to the shocks of the </p><p>seas which broke over her hull, yet it </p><p>seemed to me she was far from breaking up. </p><p>The massive oak beams and stanchions in </p><p>my berth were still holding in spite of the </p><p>awful hammering the bark had undergone, </p><p>and I noticed that the oak hanging-knees </p><p>had not started, nor had the planking open- </p><p>ed up. I could not see through the port, </p><p>owing to the fact that the deadlights had </p><p>been shipped over them when we passed the </p><p>Rio Plata in readiness for the stormy </p><p>weather of the Horn. </p><p> The shocks were perceptibly lessening,</p><p>and as I puzzled myself for an explanation, </p><p>I remembered the tide. </p><p> “Why, to be sure, the tide is falling, and</p><p>we must have canted over with our decks </p><p>toward the shore.” Thus thinking, I struck </p><p>a match and lit a candle. </p><p> Quietly unlocking my door I peered out.</p><p>The lee side of the cabin was swashing </p><p>with water and littered with the debris of </p><p>table and seats. A great gap where the </p><p>skylight had been yawned overhead, and </p><p>across the square of gray daylight which </p><p>showed came streams of chilly spray. The </p><p>candle was blown out, but there was enough </p><p>light to discern things by. As I glanced</p><p>around the flooded apartment I could see </p><p>no sign of Silvera. </p><p> “Must have gone on deck,” I murmured,</p><p>and scrambling across the sloping floor I </p><p>crawled up the companionway and looked </p><p>around on the ruin I had wrought. It was </p><p>blowing very hard and the spindrift from </p><p>the welter of whitcwater we were lying in </p><p>was flying athwart the air. Ahead towered </p><p>a great wall of cliff which loomed hazily in </p><p>the half light of the semi-antarctic morning, </p><p>and which was blotted from sight inter- </p><p>mittently by veils of rainy mist. </p><p> I he vessel was lying over on her star-</p><p>board bilge with her bottom facing seaward. </p><p>All the masts had gone by the board and </p><p>could be seen in a tangled ralBe of spars, </p><p>canvas and cordage, swashing among the </p><p>rocks at the foot of the dills. The for’ard </p><p>house was still standing, and I made out </p><p>something which had been a mystery to me. </p><p>The tank which had once reposed on top of </p><p>the house had disappeared, and in its stead </p><p>I saw the shining barrel of a cannon known </p><p>as a Parrott rifle-gun! </p><p>AS MY eyes got used to the gloom, </p><p>I saw that we were lying in a slight </p><p>indentation in the cliff wall—a sort </p><p>of cove or fiord with a litter of broken rocks </p><p>and boulders rising in a steep* pile to the </p><p>apex of a triangle formed by two unbroken </p><p>walls of stone. By crawling for'ard and </p><p>clambering out on the bowsprit, :t would be </p><p>possible to drop on to dry land. And with </p><p>the craving for life still strong within me. I </p><p>jumped below to ransack the pantry for </p><p>food and water. The storeroom lay to </p><p>starboard, and to reach it I had to wade </p><p>waist deep in chilly water. </p><p> Entering, I stulled my pockets and the</p><p>inside of my shirt with biscuits and some </p><p>dried apples. There was no water in the </p><p>place, and trusting to find some when I </p><p>reached the shore, I crawled along the </p><p>weather rail to the fo’c's'le head and out </p><p>on the bowsprit. The headstavs were dang- </p><p>ling down from the spar, and I was soon </p><p>slipping and sprawling around on the weed </p><p>and kelp covered rocks. </p><p> Before 1 gained high-water mark, I was</p><p>destined to stumble, over three almost un- </p><p>recognizable bodies, but the sight excited </p><p>no qualms of conscience. They deserved </p><p>their fate, and though I had the blood of </p><p>some thirty-three men on my head, 1 felt </p><p>that I had become but an instrument of </p><p>vengeance in the hands of a just Deity. </p><p> Heedless of the cold, I scrambled up the</p><p>slippery boulders to the apex of the cleft. </p><p>It was with some satisfaction that I noted </p><p>that the cliffs were not so inaccessible as </p><p>they appeared from seaward. There were </p><p>numerous ledges and cracks which would </p><p>The Whaler </p><p>67 </p><p>not make climbing difficult to a sailorman </p><p>used to scaling giddy heights. </p><p> I was tightening my belt and buttoning</p><p>up my coat in preparation to make the as- </p><p>cent, when I heard the rattle of boulders </p><p>behind me, and I wheeled around in time to </p><p>see Silvera in the act of hurling a mighty </p><p>rock in my direction. With a smothered </p><p>oath, he hove the stone, and I leaped aside </p><p>in time to escape being dashed to the </p><p>ground. </p><p>TWy I HAD no weapons, and I was no </p><p>^5 match for Silvera in strength. But </p><p>I could see by the terrible look in his </p><p>eyes that he meant to kill me, and so, as he </p><p>rushed toward me with his great hands out- </p><p>stretched to grasp my throat, I picked up a </p><p>small stone and struck him square in the </p><p>face with it. He stopped and clapped his </p><p>hands to his mouth. While I backed away, </p><p>he grabbed another piece of jagged rock and </p><p>advanced with the blood streaming from </p><p>his nose and his tangled beard streaked </p><p>white with crusted salt. </p><p> “I’ll fix you, my bully!” he roared. “You</p><p>think you’ve finished my hash-” </p><p> I leaped behind a huge sea-bleached</p><p>stone just as he hurled his missile, and </p><p>while he stooped to pick up another, I </p><p>pelted him with all my strength with an- </p><p>other small piece of rock. It struck him on </p><p>the cheek, cutting it to the bone, and wrhile </p><p>I grabbed two more, he drove a chunk </p><p>smack into my ribs with terrific force. I </p><p>gasped and hurled both my missiles at him. </p><p>One missed, but the other bowled him over. </p><p>Following up my advantage, I grasped a </p><p>large stone and launched it at his head. It </p><p>struck him square in the middle of the back </p><p>as he rolled over, and he collapsed with a </p><p>growl of rage. </p><p> Several times he attempted to rise to his</p><p>feet, but somehow or other he was powerless. </p><p>While I waited with another stone poised to </p><p>brain him with as soon as he gained his </p><p>knees, he gave an agonized cry, more like </p><p>that of a wild beast than of a human being, </p><p>and shrieked: </p><p> “Kill me! Kill me! My back is broken!”</p><p> And as I watched him groveling on the</p><p>pebbles and clawing out with his hands in a</p><p>vain effort to rise, I saw that this evidently </p><p>was the case. My missile had caught him </p><p>in the small of the back just as he was jump- </p><p>ing to his feet, and the blow had broken </p><p>his spine. </p><p> I stepped up to him, still holding on to my</p><p>stone. He snarled at me like a trapped wolf. </p><p>His face dripped blood, and with his matted </p><p>hair, tangled beard, and the eyes literally </p><p>ablaze with hate and savage defiance, he </p><p>made a frightful picture as he lay on the </p><p>gravel with his fingers tearing into the peb- </p><p>bles in his helpless rage. </p><p>gj"g “CAPTAIN SILVERA!” I said </p><p>inmi calmly. “You and I arc quits now. </p><p> You’ve got to make your peace with</p><p>God for the lives you have sent into eternity </p><p>for greed of gold. You’re a dying man!" </p><p> “Dyin’ be cussed!” he shrieked. “Oh,</p><p>blast you, Dixon! It’s you that has done </p><p>all this! It’s you that piled th’ vessel </p><p> “Yes,” I answered. “I piled her up and</p><p>I did it purposely-” </p><p> “You did?”</p><p> He snapped the question out doubtfully.</p><p>“Aye, I did. I fixed your compass; told </p><p>you to crack on, and there’s the result." </p><p> And I pointed to the hulk King a cable’s</p><p>length belowr in the spume and froth of the </p><p>breakers. </p><p> “What-made you do that?" he said after a</p><p>pause, a little more calmly. “I always </p><p>treated you well.” </p><p> “Yes,” I replied, “and I was to navigate</p><p>the bark to Hiva Nuku and then you’d toss </p><p>me to the sharks. It was my skill as a </p><p>navigator which saved me, that’s all. You’d </p><p>have hove me over the side off Nantucket </p><p>Shoals if Joe Smith hadn’t told you I had </p><p>been an officer. I owe you nothing.” </p><p> He remained quiet for a spell and the</p><p>savage light died out of his eyes. </p><p> “What do you know?’ he inquired at</p><p>length. </p><p> “I know' that you and your crew were</p><p>nothing more than pirates pretending to be </p><p>whalers,” I answered. “I know that you </p><p>looted and sunk two ships, murdering their </p><p>crews. I wasn't drugged the time the Sea </p><p>King was looted. I did not drink the water </p><p>until after the crime wTas committed.” </p><p> He nodded.</p><p> “D’ye think I’ll die?”</p><p> “You’ll die ultimately,” I replied without</p><p>emotion. “We may both die, but 3’ou’ll </p><p>die first. A broken back won’t kill you </p><p>right away, but starvation will get you very </p><p>soon.”</p><p> And as I shot a glance behind me, I saw</p><p>the tide was on the turn. </p><p>68 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> ‘‘I’ll have to leave you,” I said. “Will</p><p>1 haul you up the beach?" </p><p> “No!” he growled. “Let me be.”</p><p> “Will you have a biscuit?”</p><p> “No! Save it for yourself; you'll need it</p><p>soon enough.” </p><p> 1 was about to say good-by to him when</p><p>he spoke. </p><p> “Wait a spell, Dixon. I'm go in’ t’ slip</p><p>my shackle soon, but I might as well give </p><p>you a true bill. Stand by for a minute or so, </p><p>an I’ll get all hands into the tar-pot. Will </p><p>ye hear me?” </p><p> I nodded and sat down on a boulder</p><p>alongside him. It was raining and bitterly </p><p>cold. The wind was howling in the fissures; </p><p>slaty storm-racked sky, gray sea, and gray </p><p>cliffs fringed with roaring breakers made </p><p>up a melancholy vista of desolation and </p><p>misery. Add to the picture of dreary land </p><p>and sea the battered hulk in the surf, the </p><p>scattered bodies, the two living creatures— </p><p>one helpless and doomed already and the </p><p>other with but a doubtful span of life before </p><p>him—and the weird and mournful squawk </p><p>of the penguins in the fissures, and you have </p><p>an idea of the depressive background in </p><p>which I listened to Silvera’s confession. </p><p>CHAPTER X </p><p>SILVERA UNBOSOMS HIMSELF </p><p>“TF YOU get clear, Dixon, I’ll have you </p><p>-*■ make a report on what I 'm goin’ to say. </p><p>Go to th’ nearest Yankee Consul an’ tell </p><p>him th’ whole yarn. I'll bet it’ll raise his </p><p>hair some. Now if you'll listen I’ll spin you </p><p>th’ story. </p><p> “I’ve been most kinds of a sailor in my</p><p>day—privateerin’, slavin’, an’ running’ th’ </p><p>slave embargo. Then I went my last two </p><p>or three voyages whalin’ as boat-steerer an’ </p><p>harpooneer. In ’6t, me and our cooper, </p><p>a man called Jake Thompson, jumped the </p><p>ship in New Zealand an’ sundowned it </p><p>for the Otago gold diggin’s. We struck it </p><p>rich, sold out for fifty thousand dollars </p><p>apiece, and went to San Francisco with our </p><p>pile. </p><p> “Thompson started a kind of tradin' ven-</p><p>ture among the Islands and I came East an’ </p><p>did some gun-runnin’ in a schooner ’round </p><p>th’ Gulf ports. I lost a good deal o’ my dol- </p><p>lars at that game an’ lost th’ schooner as </p><p>well, so I went West again and found </p><p>Thompson in ’Frisco doin’ a roarin’ busi-</p><p>ness with his tradin’ company. Then I </p><p>broached my scheme to him. </p><p> “They were raakin' big strikes in th’</p><p>Bendigo an’ Ballarat gold fields of Aus- </p><p>tralia, an’ miners were cornin' over to </p><p>’Frisco with stories of th’ gold that was </p><p>bein’ shipped out o’ th’ country in th' clip- </p><p>pers ’round th’ Horn. This give me an </p><p>idea, an’ I reckoned if a man had a fast </p><p>sailin’ packet an’ a crew he could rely on </p><p>there wouldn't be much difficulty in piratin' </p><p>a few o’ them gold ships. </p><p> “We talked th’ thing over an' we decided</p><p>that th’ best kind o’ craft to use for th’ </p><p>business would be a whaler. Whaleships </p><p>have a kind o’ rovin’ commission; they kin </p><p>go anywhere an’ cruise aroun’ without </p><p>causin’ suspicion. Ye kin carry a pile o’ </p><p>boats an' keep steady masthead lookouts, </p><p>an’ your papers allow you to enter any port. </p><p> “Havin' both been whalemen, we de-</p><p>cided that a whaler would be th best kind o’ </p><p>craft to use. A schooner would be too </p><p>small an’ liable to be overhauled by th’ </p><p>first gunboat what seen her cruisin' around, </p><p>an’ a marchant vessel would be more sus- </p><p>picious than anythin', so th’ wjialer was la’ </p><p>best lay. </p><p>“NOW, as it wasn’t an}’ easy job </p><p>pickin’ out th’ craft what carried th’ </p><p>dust, we had t’ figure out *-me plan </p><p>for knowin’ likely vessels, as I didn’t calcu- </p><p>late on stoppin’ an’ overhaulin' every Aus- </p><p>traliaman we met. You must remember </p><p>that every ship we stopped would have to </p><p>be got rid of, or they’d be for reportin’ our </p><p>actions to th’ first cruiser they met, an' we’d </p><p>be done for. So, rememberin' this, we </p><p>picked up four likely fellows an’ let them </p><p>into our plans, and we fixed things up in </p><p>this way. </p><p> “I was to go East an’ buy an’ fit out a</p><p>likely craft for a whalin’ voyage. Thomp- </p><p>son supplied th’ rhino for th’ scheme. Th’ </p><p>four men who were in th’ game with us </p><p>were to make for Melbun an’ hang aroun’ </p><p>there until they heard of a ship leavin’ for </p><p>England with a consignment o’ gold, an’ </p><p>they were to sign on as foremast hands </p><p>aboard of her. We reckoned that two pack- </p><p>ets with a bunch o’ homeward-bound miners </p><p>an’ their dust would about do us. Th* two </p><p>men who signed on in each ship were to get </p><p>into each watch, port an’ starboard, so s </p><p>to be able to keep an eye open for us all th’ </p><p>time. </p><p>The Whaler </p><p>69</p><p> “Sailormen were scarce enough in Mel-</p><p>bun with th’ crews cuttin’ stick for th’ </p><p>diggin’s, an’ we knew they’d have no trou- </p><p>ble in shippin’ themselves. We were to be </p><p>cruisin’ about in th’ homeward track jest </p><p>west o’ th’ Cape Verde Islands, an’ they’d </p><p>arrange to signal us in some way or other. </p><p>We fixed things pretty well an’ there wasn’t </p><p>so much chance o’ mistakes as you’d maybe </p><p>think. </p><p> “I came East by the Overland Trail, an’</p><p>picked up the Arcturus in Savannah very </p><p>cheap, an’ scrapin’ up a crew I had her </p><p>brought to Noo Bedford an’ altered for </p><p>whalin’. Then I got a Parrott rifie-gun an’ </p><p>fixed boards over it to make it look like a </p><p>tank or bosun’s locker-” </p><p> “How did you allay suspicions around</p><p>New Bedford when you fetched that gun </p><p>aboard?” </p><p> “No suspicions at all. A lot o’ whale-</p><p>ships carried cannon for protection against </p><p>pirates in the Eastern channels an’ nobody </p><p>thought anythin’ about it. I sounded my </p><p>crowd what I had scraped together an’ made </p><p>sure they’d be ready for anythin’. </p><p> “Then I picked up a feller named Lam-</p><p>son for first mate an’ navigator. I was no </p><p>navigator myself, an’ for th’ business we </p><p>needed a good man. This Lamson was a </p><p>clever joker, but when I broached my plans, </p><p>he tried to escape while we were anchored </p><p>out in th’ Bay, an’ I brained him with a </p><p>handspike-” </p><p> “I thought you said he was drunk and</p><p>fell down the companionway?” </p><p> “Aye, I told you that; but I told you a lot</p><p>o’ things. No, he wasn’t drunk, but I hit </p><p>him too hard an’ he croaked. I had to </p><p>get away to sea after that, as th’ feller be- </p><p>longed to Noo Bedford an’ I was afraid some </p><p>of his friends might be cornin’ out to visit </p><p>him afore we sailed. I got outside an’ </p><p>cruised around intendin’ for to send a boat </p><p>in to shore next momin’ to get hold of an- </p><p>other mate, an’ while I was standin’ off </p><p>an on, your ship most cut us down an’ you </p><p>fell aboard. Lucky for both of us. You </p><p>were jest th man I needed; ef you weren’t, </p><p>1 d have had you over th’ side long afore </p><p>now. I reckon you know th’ rest o’ th’ </p><p>yarn pretty well-” </p><p> Tell me!” I interrupted. “What were</p><p>you going to do if the vessels had Dassed </p><p>you in the night?” </p><p> He smiled contemptuously.</p><p> I arranged for that. AJ1 th’ time we were</p><p>on th’ cruisin’ ground I had a red an’ white</p><p>lantern hangin’ under th’ bowsprit, an’ </p><p>ever)' vessel we saw, we gave chase to. We </p><p>only saw two craft at night, anyhow." </p><p> I nodded.</p><p> “Finish your story.”</p><p>“WAAL, there ain’t much more. We </p><p>picked up the Albemarle an’ got th’ </p><p>signal from our fellows aboard. </p><p>Then I hocused you out o’ the way, an’ </p><p>looted her, an’ sent her to th’ bottom. We </p><p>got ’most two hundred an’ fifty thousand </p><p>pounds o’ dust an’ raw gold out o’ her. You </p><p>knew nawthin’ about that. </p><p> “Then w’e picked up the other fellow on</p><p>th’ Sea King—his partner was killed off </p><p>the Horn—an’ you say you saw that bit o’ </p><p>work. We got a big pile out o’ her—’most </p><p>as much as the other. That’s about all. I </p><p>reckon, ’cept that we were to he in to Hiva </p><p>Nuku until a schooner arrived an' took th' </p><p>stuff to ’Frisco. We were to follow later an’ </p><p>divide up on th’ spoil-’’ </p><p> “The crewr as well?”</p><p> He gave a wTy smile.</p><p> “Some o’ them only. I would lose a few</p><p>between the Islands an? th' Golden Gate. </p><p>Sickness, y'knowT, forces me to give up th' </p><p>v’y’ge.” </p><p> I looked down on him with abhorrence.</p><p>“You’re a pretty dirty scoundrel,” I said. </p><p>“But I thank the Lord I’ve fetched you and </p><p>your gang up all standing. I’ve been a fool, </p><p>but I wasn't so foolish as you thought I was, </p><p>and two can play at a game of bluff. How- </p><p>ever, it’s all finished now and I wish you no </p><p>harm. Pray, if you know how, for I've got </p><p>to be moving.” </p><p> He laughed harshly.</p><p> “Pray? Huh! I’m no crawler! H there's</p><p>such a place as hell, then I'm bound for it, </p><p>an’ there’ll be plenty to hail me when I get </p><p>there, but we’ll all go th’ same road. Re- </p><p>member Jake Thompson. San Francisco. </p><p>Ef you get clear, go to a Consul an' swear </p><p>to what I’ve told you. I want him to swing. </p><p>Will you do what I say?'’ </p><p> “If I get clear, I will!”</p><p> I was rising to move away, when he cried</p><p>appealingly: </p><p> “Say, Dixon, I'm a goner, I know, but</p><p>don’t leave me to starve. I'll jest ask you </p><p>one thing an’ I hope ye’ll do it. Knock my </p><p>brains out an’ put me out o’ misery--” </p><p> “No, no, no!” I cried, shuddering with the</p><p>hideousness of the suggestion. </p><p>7°	Adventure</p><p> “Then strangle me! Kill me in some way!</p><p>God, man, don’t leave me here to perish</p><p>alone!” </p><p> Sick with cold and the horror of the</p><p>tilings I had seen and heard, I staggered up </p><p>against the rock wall with his entreaties </p><p>ringing in my ears. </p><p> “Come on, Dison, 1 ike a good fellow'! Fix</p><p>me somehow, but don't leave me, for God’s </p><p>sake. Heave me in tli’ surf! Drown in’s </p><p>easy.” </p><p> I steeled my nerves and rushed toward</p><p>him. </p><p> “God forgive me!” I murmured, and I</p><p>dragged and lugged him down to the edge </p><p>of the advancing breakers. </p><p> “Out to th' ledge there an’ topple me in!”</p><p>he commanded. </p><p> Obeying his commands, I pulled him over</p><p>the kelp-covered rocks to the edge of the </p><p>ledge. Then for a moment my resolution </p><p>wavered. </p><p> “Over with me, man!” he roared. “Over</p><p>with me! It will be a mercy!” </p><p> I stood back in terror.</p><p> “I can’t! I can’t!” I wailed.</p><p> His hands clawed at the wTeeds and he</p><p>dragged himself to the brink. </p><p> “So long!” he shouted, and as I stared at</p><p>him in paralyzed fright, he rolled into the </p><p>churning sea. </p><p>CHAPTER XI </p><p>I CHANGE MY VOCATION </p><p>HOW I scaled the cliffs I do not know', </p><p>but when I came to my natural mind </p><p>again I was stumbling through the tussock </p><p>grass and causing an uproar among the pen- </p><p>guins, boobies, and other sea fowl nesting </p><p>in the coarse vegetation. I wandered </p><p>around for many hours until I stumbled </p><p>upon a rude hut constructed out of wreck- </p><p>age and sail cloth. Here I lived for days, </p><p>subsisting upon raw eggs and the biscuits </p><p>I had brought with me, until I was picked </p><p>up by a small Falkland Islands schooner </p><p>beach-combing around the coast for wreck- </p><p>age. </p><p> I told them of the wrecked whaler, but</p><p>nothing of the gold in her lazaretto nor the </p><p>circumstances which led to my being cast </p><p>ashore on Staten Land. They cruised in </p><p>the direction of the place where she was ly- </p><p>ing, but not a vestige of her fabric remained, </p><p>though pieces of her hull and spars were </p><p>seen in the clefts and ledges. </p><p> After being landed at Port Stanley I made</p><p>my way over to Montevideo and reported </p><p>the affair to the United States Consul. </p><p>That gentleman promptly had me arrested </p><p>and confined as a lunatic. I was released</p><p>and went to Bueuos Ayres, and the Consuls, </p><p>both British and American, listened to my </p><p>tale with incredulous wonder, and quickly </p><p>had me thrown out into the street. Not a </p><p>soul would believe me, and the newspapers </p><p>published an account of a crazy sailor </p><p>whose mind had been upset by reading of </p><p>the disappearance of two homeward-bound </p><p>Australian clippers. </p><p> Eventually I joined a ship lx»und for</p><p>'Frisco. Upon arrival I saw the authorities </p><p>and told tJiem of the connection of one </p><p>Jake Thompson with the affair. Thomp- </p><p>son's trading company had gone u </p><p>business a few months before arid Thomp- </p><p>son himself was no longer in tlfe city. I </p><p>was laughed at and discredited wherever I </p><p>went; the affair was a standing joke in the </p><p>newspapers for many weeks. They wil- </p><p>lingly believed that I was one of the tu- </p><p>rns's. crew. They believed the peculiar man- </p><p>ner in which I had come to be aboard of her. </p><p>But the rest of my tale was put down to </p><p>a disorder of the brain induced by the hard- </p><p>ships I had undergone. </p><p> Rebuffed, laughed at, and jeered on every</p><p>hand, I soon came to the conclusion that </p><p>the less I said about the events the better </p><p>for me and my future prospects. 1 left the </p><p>city and went inland gold prospecting, with </p><p>a determination never to go seafaring again. </p><p>I kept my word, and the foregoing account, </p><p>written some forty years after the affair </p><p>happened, is the only statement 1 have </p><p>made since I shook the dust of ’Frisco from </p><p>my feet. </p><p> I am a very old man now, but the Lord</p><p>has kept my memory green, and though I </p><p>often desire to forget, nevertheless the </p><p>horror of those far-off days is still in my </p><p>mind. </p><p>IT MIGHT </p><p>HAVB </p><p>HAPPENED </p><p>OTHERWISE </p><p>Hug]' </p><p>Pendexfer </p><p>Author of “The Chelsea Vase," “The Crimson Track," elc. </p><p>HE growth of the thing in his </p><p>mind had been gradual. When </p><p>it had obtruded upon his con- </p><p>sciousness at first he had drawn </p><p>back in mingled fear and anger. By de- </p><p>grees, however, he tolerated the thought, </p><p>only always at a distance, and concluded </p><p>by allowing it to make a rendezvous of his </p><p>idle meditations, receiving it much as one </p><p>might welcome an unwholesome but highly</p><p>fascinating acquaintance. All the time he </p><p>knew its real name was Theft. </p><p> For three years Parsly had served as sta-</p><p>tion agent and telegraph-operator at the </p><p>Junction. Each day he had observed the </p><p>transient bustling by the long platform, </p><p>the spectacle never varying. Long vesti- </p><p>buled trains halted impatiently, and always </p><p>the same curious or apathetic faces peered </p><p>out at him from the Fullmans. </p><p> It was the branch line, tapping the lum-</p><p>ber country, that contributed humanism, </p><p>consisting of a nodding acquaintance with </p><p>timber operators and forlorn commercial </p><p>travelers. The first were always in a hurry </p><p>to make the big city connection; the latter </p><p>lingered in his company for the sake of gain- </p><p>ing an audience while they cursed the </p><p>country. </p><p> The last because the Junction was not the</p><p>liveliest place in the world to put in an </p><p>hour or two of waiting. Situated where the </p><p>engineering problem had been the simplest, </p><p>it was surrounded by blueberry plains, </p><p>dotted at intervals with scrub pine. As the </p><p>locomotives annually set the pines afire, </p><p>the immediate foreground continuously </p><p>presented a dead, charred appearance. </p><p>Far-off, the objective point of the Pullmans, </p><p>loomed the cool silhouettes of mountains, </p><p>guardians of inland lakes and famous fish- </p><p>ing. </p><p> More than once Parsly compared him-</p><p>self with Robinson Crusoe in his isolation; </p><p>only he had no man Friday to enliven his </p><p>dull routine. He saw much of the passing </p><p>world but was never of it. Thus, at the end </p><p>of three years, the hurrying by of the heavy </p><p>trains aroused a species of resentment. </p><p>Every one was at liberty to take flight but </p><p>him. Then again, fifty dollars a month for </p><p>his combined duties was hardly a com- </p><p>pensating solace. </p><p> It was the matter of salary that caused</p><p>the idea to germinate while he was sullenly </p><p>working the semaphore one day. He had </p><p>just received from the night branch some </p><p>four hundred dollars express money which </p><p>he must deliver to the agent on the morning </p><p>rity-passenger. Having just received his </p><p>monthly wages he could not help but con- </p><p>trast its meager total with the bulking roll </p><p>in his hip-pocket. </p><p> If he had four hundred dollars, all his</p><p>own, he would throw up the job and use it </p><p>in one delicious round of travel. By the </p><p>time it was exhausted he could obtain an- </p><p>other position in a pleasing environment.</p><p>In logical sequence he decided he might as </p><p>well allow his imagination a wider range </p><p>and play at taking a vacation with the </p><p>largest sum ever entrusted to his care for a </p><p>single night. He remembered this to be an </p><p>even thousand dollars, sent down by a big </p><p>72 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>operator in payment for horses in the lum- </p><p>ber camps. </p><p> A thousand dollars offered his fancy</p><p>vastly more possibilities to work with. The </p><p>four hundred became insignificant. As his </p><p>duties permitted him much time for reflec- </p><p>tion, he carried the thought back to his </p><p>dingy office and entertained it by consulting </p><p>maps in the railroad folders. In this fashion </p><p>he took a hurried excursion across the con- </p><p>tinent and spied out the land. Then he </p><p>became critical and weighed and balanced </p><p>different localities. </p><p> The Southwest, free from cold, gray Au-</p><p>tumnal rains, howling snows and Spring </p><p>inundations, finally appealed to him as be- </p><p>ing ideal. Of course, there might be two </p><p>thousand dollars entrusted to him any night, </p><p>especially now that it was Autumn and the </p><p>lumbermen were stocking up for the Winter </p><p>campaign. </p><p> It was at that precise point that his</p><p>cheek reddened and he felt a touch of </p><p>alarm as he angrily told himself such </p><p>imagining was immoral, for it was based </p><p>on the suggestion that he steal the money. </p><p>He condemned the suggestion wrathfully </p><p>as he walked a quarter of a mile to the </p><p>lonely home where he boarded, and yet </p><p>he was more downcast than ever over </p><p>his colorless place in life. </p><p> On returning to the station to close up</p><p>for the night, which meant a weary wait for </p><p>the up-passenger to pull in, he returned to </p><p>the suggestion abruptly and recklessly. It </p><p>wTas the sight of the porters making up the </p><p>berths, the comradeship in the smoking </p><p>compartment, that plunged him into full </p><p>revolt; only now he proceeded on the theory </p><p>the money was legitimately his. </p><p> “Well, I guess I've earned it. What if I</p><p>should take it, providing I could get away </p><p>with it? How would I spend it?” </p><p> This surrender eased him much. Of</p><p>course he wouldn't take it, not a penny; </p><p>but it’s impossible lo picture a career of </p><p>spending until the imagination has logically </p><p>furnished the requisite possession. Now </p><p>he had mentally satisfied his imagination </p><p>as to possession, although the technique</p><p>was illegal. Fortunately there is no law </p><p>punishing a man for inwardly discussing the </p><p>possible assets of a crime. </p><p> Of course, Parsly merely intended to pur-</p><p>sue his day-dreams unhampered by any </p><p>irritating self-criticism. He had systematic- </p><p>ally arranged his data and could spend a </p><p>million a day, should he choose. That was </p><p>where he erred. His imagination became a </p><p>hard taskmaster, very exacting. Once he </p><p>accepted the suggestion that the money </p><p>was to come to him through theft, his </p><p>methodical mind insisted on reviewing the </p><p>possibilities of detection before permitting </p><p>him to enjoy the fruits. </p><p> "Wouldn't you be caught and arrested</p><p>before you could make a beginning?” was </p><p>the cautious query he was forced to put to </p><p>himself. </p><p> Such nagging is very annoying, and to</p><p>satisfy his mysterious Pu rrhonist and con- </p><p>tinue with his Spanish architecture, he set </p><p>himself about planning how the trick could </p><p>be done without his being detected. </p><p> This was a hopeless morass at first, and</p><p>very unpleasant; for instead of picturing </p><p>innocent expenditures he found himself </p><p>sweating and struggling with the problem </p><p>of how he could keep the money once he </p><p>secured it. The more he labored the more </p><p>nimble became his other self in raising perti- </p><p>nent objections, exploding seemingly sound </p><p>theories and ridiculing his most astute </p><p>hypotheses. </p><p> To merely appropriate the money and</p><p>disappear was quickly shown to be the </p><p>height of idiocy'. That spelled a life of </p><p>slinking and fear, the flying from phann'ms. </p><p>It ttook some thought to clear the fore- </p><p>ground of discarded theories and plans and </p><p>approach the realm of finesse; but at last he </p><p>seemed to be building on a firmer founda- </p><p>tion. </p><p> Probably the frequent raids by veggmen</p><p>on rural post-offices and isolated railroad </p><p>stations stimulated this office of his imagina- </p><p>tion. For in reading the paper, presented </p><p>him gratis each evening by the newsboy on </p><p>the up-passeuger, he noted the veggmen </p><p>always securely tied whoever stood between </p><p>them and loot, cut the tell-tale wires and </p><p>cscaped. </p><p> Then came the great idea; and slapping</p><p>the paper he glanced apprehensively around </p><p>the small office, and whispered: </p><p> “If I faked a holdup the yeggs would get</p><p>the credit and I'd get the dough. It would </p><p>be a cinch, if a man wanted to play</p><p>crooked.” </p><p> Stay'! Was it so easy? The various</p><p>precautions necessary for counterfeiting a </p><p>robbery, each simple in itself, quickly </p><p>loomed into mountains. Then he decided </p><p>on just how the furniture should be broken </p><p>It Might Have Happened Otherwise </p><p>73 </p><p>and overturned to approximate realism; </p><p>just when the wires should be cut; whether </p><p>the station door should be left open or </p><p>closed, and the condition of his clothing and </p><p>pockets. As there was no safe in the office </p><p>the agent carried the moneys upon his per- </p><p>son. At first he imagined his pockets </p><p>turned inside out, then repudiated the </p><p>thought as being too clumsy. </p><p> But what about the tying-up portion of</p><p>the programme? Could a man tie himself </p><p>so as to convince his rescuers that his pre- </p><p>dicament was genuine? Of course, there was </p><p>a chance, rather a good one, too, of his land- </p><p>lord, foreman of the section crew, coming </p><p>to his aid and cutting the cords without </p><p>making any particular observations. Still, </p><p>only perfection of detail would satisfy his </p><p>exacting critic. </p><p> Now, Parsly, if slow of thought at times,</p><p>was dogged in his persistence once he grap- </p><p>pled with a problem. He now gave his </p><p>spare time to studying ropes and knots. </p><p> The newspapers had charged up the vari-</p><p>ous robberies to Fresno Red and his gang, </p><p>and had dwelt at length on the method </p><p>used in each case in tying up watchman or </p><p>agent. Invariably one end of the rope was </p><p>made fast about the feet and ankles of the </p><p>captive, then passed up and around the </p><p>waist, the hands being caught and tied be- </p><p>hind the back; the loose end finally being </p><p>made fast about the captive’s neck in a slip- </p><p>noose. </p><p> It was done very quickly, each victim had</p><p>averred, and so hampered a man that the </p><p>more he struggled the more he endangered </p><p>his life by self-strangulation. It was a </p><p>method worthy of the redoubtable Fresno </p><p>Red, and one Parsly now attacked to satisfy </p><p>his insistence on correct detail. </p><p>THAT night he surreptitiously car- </p><p>ried a piece of new rope home. He </p><p>had already discovered that new </p><p>rope would not slip like old, smoothly worn </p><p>rope. In the secrecy of his small chamber </p><p>he essayed the simple task of tying his own </p><p>feet. His heart beat rapidly as he pulled </p><p>the knot tight; then he laug'hed vacuously </p><p>and told himself it was all a game. It ended</p><p>where it began, merely a pastime. He did </p><p>not attempt to duplicate the veggmen’s </p><p>knots further that night. </p><p> He would not concede that he stood in</p><p>fear of the trooping suggestions now be- </p><p>setting h:m and eagerly offering aid. Yet </p><p>he fought hard to put the thoughts from his </p><p>mind during the morning hours and felt </p><p>extremely virtuous as he handed the down </p><p>agent the customary parcel of money. </p><p> That night he relaxed and deftly tied his</p><p>feet, passed the line about his waist and </p><p>clumsily wound it around his wrists. He </p><p>remained awake more than an hour trying </p><p>to solve the rest of the problem—how to </p><p>fasten the rope about his wrists so it would </p><p>be impossible to free himself and then </p><p>secure the end about his neck. He decided </p><p>it couldn’t be done, and fell asleep. </p><p> Toward morning, when but half awake,</p><p>he heard a voice adWse— </p><p> “Tie the rope first about the neck.”</p><p> He popped up to a sitting posture and</p><p>stared wildly about the dark chamber. He </p><p>knew it was a suggestion from his inner </p><p>self, yet so distinctly did he hear the words </p><p>it seemed as if they must have been voiced </p><p>aloud. Throughout the early morning he </p><p>brooded over the suggestion. At first he </p><p>could not discern any sense in it. Subcon- </p><p>sciously, however, he had often noticed the </p><p>lumberman’s trick of using a clove-hitch— </p><p>two half-hitches—and gradually the recol- </p><p>lection thrust itself above the threshold of </p><p>consciousness. He believed he had succeeded. </p><p> He must make the rope fast about his</p><p>neck while standing, then secure it about </p><p>his ankles with practically no slack, con- </p><p>tinuing the loose end to his waist and tying </p><p>it, talung care to have it pass outside the </p><p>rope running from neck to heels. Then by </p><p>throwing back his head and heels he would </p><p>obtain enough slack to make the two </p><p>double loops, or half - hitches, through </p><p>which he could work his wrists. </p><p> The last operation, he realized, would</p><p>demand great care, as he must thrust his </p><p>hands in from opposite direcions until wrist </p><p>overlapped wrist. If it would work he </p><p>would dismiss the matter and resume the </p><p>pleasing visions of spending the money. </p><p> The morning’s paper contained a glaring</p><p>account of a daring yegg robbery at the </p><p>Centerville station. The agent had been </p><p>trussed up and some fifteen hundred dollars </p><p>taken. </p><p> “Those guv’s certainly got the nerve,”</p><p>commented the newsboy as the agent was</p><p>reading the item. “Didn’t even gag </p><p>Roberts. Just corded him up like a bale </p><p>of hay, copped his roll and beat it. Roberts </p><p>is so scared he’s working his notice.” </p><p> That afternoon Parsly was curious to</p><p>M </p><p>Adventure </p><p>examine all baggage fastened with ropes. </p><p>Several parcels of sample dowels, sent by </p><p>express from the up-country mill, held his </p><p>attention the closest. They were tied with </p><p>new rope and the clove-hitch held tightly, </p><p>even when he worked an end loose. Just </p><p>before he closed up for supper the branch </p><p>train brought in a hundred-odd dollars, but </p><p>the agent confidentially assured: </p><p> “Tomorrer’U be a record breaker. Two</p><p>parties I know of are going to send down a </p><p>thousand per. Together with the other </p><p>money you’ll have close to three thousand </p><p>bones to nurse over night. The danged </p><p>company ought to put a safe in your </p><p>office.” </p><p> Off duty for the night, he hastened to his</p><p>room where the supreme test awaited him. </p><p>If he succeeded there was nothing to pre- </p><p>vent a man from robbing himself and leav- </p><p>ing no clues. When from the open door he </p><p>could catch the sound of his landlord’s </p><p>heavy, regular breathing, he removed his </p><p>shoes, seated himself on the edge of the bed, </p><p>and began experimenting with the cord. </p><p> He fastened the noose about his neck and</p><p>stood up and noted where the rope in a </p><p>direct line touched the floor. Then seating </p><p>himself he tied it tightly about his ankles </p><p>and brought the loose end up to and around </p><p>his waist. There was scarcely any slack </p><p>when he straightened out his legs. At first </p><p>he feared he had drawn the cord too tight </p><p>and, anxiously turning on his face, threw </p><p>back his head and heels. </p><p> With a thrill of elation he found the slack</p><p>would enable him, by an effort, to form the </p><p>hitch. After a moment’s fumbling he suc- </p><p>ceeded, and even wriggled his hands through </p><p>the loops until the tips of the fingers rested </p><p>on the upper forearm. It wearied him, and </p><p>with a sigh of physical relief he extended </p><p>his legs. </p><p> In an instant his tongue felt too large for</p><p>his mouth, and with a gasp of horror he de- </p><p>cided he was choking to death. He did not </p><p>lose his nerve as he remembered the remedy, </p><p>and he drew back his legs. But although </p><p>this gave a bit of slack to the rope he could </p><p>not induce the hitch to loosen. From the </p><p>satisfaction of having proven his theory he</p><p>quickly glided into the fear that he had cal- </p><p>culated too nicely. </p><p> Had the rope been old and smooth, or had</p><p>his hands been imprisoned palm to palm, </p><p>finger tip to finger tip, he might have secured </p><p>a leverage and by working them apart have </p><p>succeeded in wrenching one free. But the </p><p>new rope refused to give, and for a minute </p><p>he lay quiet, panting for breath, and taking </p><p>great care to bring no strain on his neck. </p><p> Down-stairs the old clock was ponder-</p><p>ously ticking off the seconds; and he re- </p><p>mained a prisoner. His heart chilled as he </p><p>feared he must summon the foreman to </p><p>come to his rescue. But how could he </p><p>explain his peculiar plight? What suspi- </p><p>cions might not his predicament arouse? </p><p> This dread quickly gave way before one</p><p>more chance. The noose seemed to be tight- </p><p>ening about his neck, and he remembered </p><p>the foreman was a heavy sleeper. His wife </p><p>occupied a room with her small children at </p><p>the other end of the house. He doubted his </p><p>ability to call help; if he did not he might </p><p>slowly strangle to death. </p><p> Already the cold sweat was trickling into</p><p>his eyes and it required a mighty effort </p><p>of the will to restrain himself from thrashing </p><p>about. He knew, however, that the mo- </p><p>ment he lost control of his nerves and moved </p><p>incautiously his wind would be shu* off. </p><p>Gritting his teeth he drew his heels far back </p><p>like an acrobat. He was lying face down </p><p>with the bedclothes half smothering him. </p><p>Then he gently picked at the rope with his </p><p>finger tips. Useless. The cords held his </p><p>wrists like bands of iron. </p><p> Finally he managed to work the cord</p><p>between the fingers of his left hand and </p><p>exert a pressure upward, hoping to loosen </p><p>the hitch. His essay was barren of results </p><p>for some moments, and it was not until he </p><p>was about to collapse that he felt his right </p><p>hand moving more freely. With an in- </p><p>articulate cry of triumph he wrenched his </p><p>wrist smartly, and instantly felt the cord </p><p>renew its grip like a sentient thing. It was </p><p>like a cat playing with a mouse. </p><p> Breathing in dry sobs he slowly sought to</p><p>recover the lost ground and persevered </p><p>until he again was pushing upward on the </p><p>cord. For the second time he felt the right </p><p>hand move a bit; this time he worked it </p><p>back and forth most gently and at last man- </p><p>aged to pull it free. Even then it required </p><p>some minutes to remove the rope from his </p><p>throat. </p><p> “- the thing!” he choked, sinking</p><p>back exhausted. “It nearly got me!” </p><p> That night he dreamed of the money</p><p>brought in by the branch train; only there </p><p>were cars and cars loaded with it, and it </p><p>was all in gold, and men were removing it </p><p>It Might Have Happened Otherwise </p><p>75 </p><p>with huge scoops, just as they shovel out </p><p>yellow corn. </p><p> By morning he had regained his normal</p><p>tone and even felt inclined to laugh at him- </p><p>self. After all, had he not done what he </p><p>set out to accomplish—to prove a man </p><p>could effectually make himself a prisoner? </p><p>Had he been engaged in a bona fide robbery </p><p>he would not have attempted to free him- </p><p>self. His success in escaping detection </p><p>would be his utter inability to do so. In </p><p>that case, of course, he would expect to en- </p><p>dure the torture till help reached him. </p><p> What odds if a man suffered a few hours</p><p>of physical agony, if it resulted in supply- </p><p>ing him with several thousand dollars? He </p><p>now clearly appreciated that had his experi- </p><p>ment been less successful he would have </p><p>been grievously disappointed; the problem </p><p>would have remained an obstacle to his </p><p>imagination, and his dangerous, although </p><p>alluring, fancies needs must be postponed. </p><p>On the whole he felt rather proud of his </p><p>achievement. </p><p>ALL day the great idea kept </p><p>pounding through his head. He </p><p>had it in his power to obtain more </p><p>than two thousand, possibly three thousand, </p><p>dollars without being suspected. His tem- </p><p>ples throbbed and ached as the thought as- </p><p>sailed him. Once or twice during the after- </p><p>noon he was called to the baggage-room to </p><p>check a trunk. Each time his gaze involun- </p><p>tarily sought the coil of new rope hanging </p><p>behind the door. </p><p> It was w'ell known to students of crime</p><p>that veggmen pick up their tools on the </p><p>premises of the place robbed, traveling un- </p><p>hampered by the burglar’s usual outfit. </p><p>How natural that they should appropriate a </p><p>piece of this very cord to bind him with! </p><p>That would necessitate the shattering of the </p><p>lock, but the door was old and w'eak and a </p><p>well-delivered kick would smash it loose. </p><p>He had no appetite for supper and heard </p><p>but little of the foreman’s gossip. </p><p> “I was saying I'd like to play you a game</p><p>of crib tonight if you feel in trim,” repeated </p><p>the foreman. </p><p> “Crib? Oh, of course. Sure, Danny.</p><p>I’ll play crib. I’ll be home right after the</p><p>up-train pulls out. I’ll be home in good </p><p>season,” eagerly promised Parsly, suddenly </p><p>realizing the foreman might get impatient </p><p>at waiting, might take alarm at his board- </p><p>er s failure to reach home, and go in search </p><p>of him. That would eliminate long, slov,- </p><p>hours of torture on the office floor. </p><p> “Yes, I’ll be home right after the nine-</p><p>o'clock goes up,” he said. “I won’t keep </p><p>you waiting.” </p><p> While returning through the woods it</p><p>suddenly came home to him that he had </p><p>planned to steal the money. For a mo- </p><p>ment he felt strongly moved and made a </p><p>feeble pretense of denying the accusation. </p><p>Then with a drawn face he muttered: </p><p> “- it! Why sidestep? It’s been in</p><p>my nut for days. I’ll never get another </p><p>chance like this—so much dough and the </p><p>yeggs near.’1 </p><p> He sought to distract his mind by bitterly</p><p>assailing the railroad and express com- </p><p>panies and assuring himself the thought </p><p>would never have occurred to him had he </p><p>been paid something beyond a starvation </p><p>wage for a fourteen-hour day. It really </p><p>wasn’t robbery. Laws were made by men. </p><p>It was reprisal. When it came to the ethic? </p><p>of it—only Parsly didn’t know what the </p><p>word meant—he’d earned the money, at </p><p>least a part of it. </p><p> The night connived at his purpose, blow-</p><p>ing up cold and desolate and on the verge </p><p>of a storm. By the time the branch pulled </p><p>in, the platform was streaming rivulets from </p><p>the heavy downpour, and the express agent </p><p>made the office on the run. </p><p> “Here’s the stuff!” he yelped, tossing a</p><p>package on the table. “Nothing to hold </p><p>us and we’re going right back. So long." </p><p> Parslv breathed more freely. Sometimes</p><p>a mixup over freight, or a hot-box, kept the </p><p>train, with the men careless of the passing </p><p>minutes, as they had no schedule to make </p><p>on the return run to Waverlv, the first </p><p>station, where they would hold the siding </p><p>for the night. </p><p> Outside, the rain was falling with a thun-</p><p>derous clamor, smearing the window panes </p><p>till it was impossible to make out the </p><p>switch-lights directly in front of the station. </p><p>Parsly rose, his eyes glittering. The money </p><p>must be concealed safely till the morrow. </p><p> He had never read Poe’s story of the pur-</p><p>loined letter, yet instinct urged a simple </p><p>hiding-place. He decided on the greasy can- </p><p>vas coat, hung back of the door. He wore </p><p>it only when cleaning the -witch-Iamps.</p><p>The packge fitted nicely into one capa- </p><p>cious pocket. No one would ever find it </p><p>there. Now to arrange the stage settings, </p><p>the overturned furniture, the open door- </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The door opened. Four men were</p><p>crowding in through the miniature water- </p><p>fall released from the loaded eaves. Parsly </p><p>eyed them as one entranced, his gaze frozen </p><p>with horror. It was no physical fear he </p><p>dreaded, but for the moment it seemed as </p><p>if his evil purpose had escaped him and now </p><p>stood crystallizedfcinto tangible shapes, each </p><p>a unit of wickedness. </p><p> “Nail the mutt!” sharply ordered the</p><p>leader, a man with a heavy shock of red </p><p>hair. </p><p> One of the men twisted Parsly’s arm</p><p>behind him and thrust an iron wrist under </p><p>his chin. Two others stood near, one hold- </p><p>ing a revolver, the other caressing a “life- </p><p>preserver. The leader was glancing about </p><p>the office. </p><p> All this occurred in a single motion, yet</p><p>it seemed to cover ages to the stupefied </p><p>agent. It was the red-headed man’s </p><p>prowling gaze that brought Parsly to his </p><p>senses. They were veggmen—Fresno Red </p><p>and his gang. They were after the money </p><p>and the leader was seeking the safe. </p><p> The man who had seized the agent was</p><p>deciding he had never in ail of his strong-arm </p><p>jobs encountered so thoroughly frightened a </p><p>victim as now’, when Parsly’s chin hugged </p><p>in and his strong teeth bit deeply into his </p><p>captor’s WTist, causing him to scream with </p><p>pain. At the same instant, the agent’s long </p><p>leg kicked out, overturning the table and </p><p>the one lamp. </p><p> The room was plunged in darkness and</p><p>the man with the revolver discharged his </p><p>weapon, evoking a shriek of mortal agony, </p><p>but not from the agent. Fresno Red called </p><p>loudly for a light while he attempted to </p><p>strike a match. Parsly had the advantage; </p><p>he knew one of the robbers was dead or seri- </p><p>ously wounded, and while every man was </p><p>his enemy in the darkness, the yeggmen </p><p>feared to injure a pal. </p><p> “Block the door and window!” roared</p><p>Fresno Red. </p><p> During this brief leeway Parsly’s groping</p><p>hands found, the office stool and he swung </p><p>it around his head in a deadly circle." By </p><p>the sickening crunch he knew at least one of </p><p>the enemy was off the active list. Then a </p><p>match flared up for a second and the leader’s </p><p>revolver exploded, the agent experiencing a</p><p>stinging sensation in the side. </p><p> For an instant Parsly felt strangely numb;</p><p>then the stool rose like a llail and the man </p><p>with the “life-preserver” sank to the floor. </p><p> Somehow the agent now felt a riotous</p><p>elation. Fear was a very distant emotion. </p><p>His veins were filled with molten lead in- </p><p>stead of blood. He breathed hate rather </p><p>than the smoky air. It was a monstrous </p><p>thing that these murderers should seek to </p><p>rob his employers. </p><p> With a wild howl of rage he plunged into</p><p>the remaining two men, kicking and smash- </p><p>ing like a maniac with the fragment of the </p><p>stool. Out through the door they poured, </p><p>another of the gang falling with a’fractured </p><p>skull. Then Parsly discovered he was alone. </p><p> He stood stupidly for a few moments,</p><p>weaving back and forth. He aroused him- </p><p>self as his dull ears caught a familiar sound. </p><p>A hand-car was being pumped down the </p><p>grade. His mind cleared to supernormal </p><p>lucidity. He saw his advantage. He had </p><p>been brutally attacked and seriously </p><p>wounded. The one man escaping would be </p><p>charged with having stolen the money; </p><p>they wrested it from him in the struggle. </p><p>He had fought hard; he'd earned it. And </p><p>yet, should he pull the lever close by his </p><p>right hand, he could throw’ open the switch </p><p>down the line and send Fresno Red crashing </p><p>into the empty coal-cars on the siding. </p><p> “You’ll never get a better chance! It</p><p>simply can’t be known and-" </p><p> “No!” he yelled, springing to the lever</p><p>and pulling it back with his last ounce of </p><p>strength. </p><p> “No,-you! No!”</p><p> Within the next minute he heard a dull</p><p>crash and knew the yegg leader had collided </p><p>with the coal-cars. Then he concluded the </p><p>wet platform w’ould be an ideal place for a </p><p>red-hot body to rest on. </p><p> “FOR the love of Mike! Parsly</p><p>Blgl down and out! One man groaning </p><p>v3lv and another dead in the office, one </p><p>stiff out here! Good Heavens!” exclaimed </p><p>the horrified foreman as he held up the lan- </p><p>tern. He had come because Parsly had </p><p>failed to keep liis promise as to the game </p><p>of cribbage. </p><p> As he read the full story in the four pros-</p><p>trate forms he collected his wits and dragged </p><p>Parsly into the office, meanwhile begging </p><p>him to “Wake up,” and “Get back his </p><p>nerve.” </p><p> “What’s the row’?” feebly asked Parsly.</p><p>Then he remembered.</p><p> “I’ve been shot. Find the instrument</p><p>and see if the wires are O. K. Hold me up </p><p>Chiquita of the Legion </p><p>77 </p><p>where I can reach it. I must send in the </p><p>alarm. The leader is down on the siding </p><p>somewhere. I shunted him off into the </p><p>empties.” </p><p> “The desperate devils was going to make</p><p>sure,” panted the foreman as he hunted for </p><p>the instrument. “They fetched two coils </p><p>of rope.” </p><p>THE papers made a great hero of </p><p>Parsly. Fresno Red, w'ho was </p><p>found with a broken shoulder, gave </p><p>him a brave record for being game. The </p><p>railroad sent a superintendent to tell him </p><p>he was in line for promotion and the express </p><p>company guardedly considered presenting </p><p>him with a reward. </p><p> “I don’t want any money,” growled</p><p>Parsly as the agent sat by his bed in the </p><p>little house. </p><p> “Cut that out. I did nothing but what’s</p><p>in the day’s work. But I’d like the Center- </p><p>ville job. Roberts, they say, is going to </p><p>quit. That pays a hundred a month.” </p><p> He was appointed two days later. Only</p><p>now he hates the sight of coiled rope and </p><p>looks upon express money as so much </p><p>junk. </p><p>CHIQUITA. </p><p>OPTHE </p><p>LEGION </p><p>Donald </p><p>Francij </p><p>McGrew </p><p>Author of “The Grenadier,” “The Guns of the Seventy-Third.etc. </p><p>I	j MET the man first when be came</p><p>in with a batch of recruits for the </p><p> ■	First Regiment of the Foreign</p><p>I—AJ Legion at Sidi-bel-Abbes, Algeria. </p><p>The girl I had known for some time, tie </p><p>was big, young, blonde, the product of rich </p><p>American parents of this day and age; she </p><p>was Spanish youth and fire. They called </p><p>her “Chiquita of the Legion.” </p><p> Him being the only American with the</p><p>bleus—ittcrde! his clothes were cut the way </p><p>they are cut along Fifth Avenue, and it </p><p>gave me a gulp in the throat—I was tempted </p><p>to fall on his neck. But he gave me a </p><p>slight chill at the outset—he w'asn’t used </p><p>to the soldiers’ method of self-introduction. </p><p> My God! ’ I heard him groan under</p><p>us breath. “My God!” And his eyes </p><p>took in the surroundings. </p><p>I read his thoughts. He was sizinir up</p><p>the barracks of the Legion—his home for </p><p>the next five years. The big yard, all </p><p>sprinkled with gravel, and bare as the </p><p>prison parade at Aden; the monstrous un- </p><p>painted barracks, looming up like so many </p><p>bams in the middle of a Wyoming plain; </p><p>the high thick walls like those that clamp </p><p>in the dead city’ of Nire; overhead a hot </p><p>African sun beating down from a glazed </p><p>blue sky—say! It was a cheerful picture. </p><p>Three thousand ligtonnaircs in white fatigue </p><p>clothes couldn't enliven it—their faces had </p><p>soaked in something as listless as the voice </p><p>of the muezzin calling to prayer. </p><p> “My God!” he muttered again. “Five</p><p>years-■/” </p><p> ‘‘You’ll get used to it,” was my cheering</p><p>comment. “What’s your name, now? </p><p>And bow’d you come to do it?” </p><p> He started to turn away from me, but I</p><p>caught him by the arm. </p><p> “Son,” I said, “we try to grin and bear</p><p>78 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>one another here. Especially countrymen. </p><p>Try’ to get into my company—the ninth— </p><p>and maybe I can help you out.” </p><p> Well, he apologized then; and after he</p><p>was assigned to my company, I was able to </p><p>help him quite a bit. But all through his </p><p>bath, and drawing his clothes, he acted </p><p>like a man in a sick dream, answering me </p><p>only with short grunts; and when he drew </p><p>his kit, and stood there moping over that </p><p>pile of blue trousers, blue tunics, white </p><p>trousers and kepis, not knowing which </p><p>strap was which, I had to give him what- </p><p>for. On the outside I would have dropped </p><p>him; but he had good cigarettes, and money </p><p>—which means wine, in the Legion. </p><p> “Buck up,” I said. “You’re in for it</p><p>now. Here—here’s how you make the </p><p>paquelage; and this is the way you make </p><p>your bunk; and here’s what you put in your </p><p>knapsack. You’ve got it to do—that or </p><p>prison. So do it.” </p><p> Perforce he did buck up a little then, but</p><p>when soup call came, he stuck up his nose </p><p>at the thought of la gamclle. We old </p><p>legionnaires were banging on the table with </p><p>our tins and yelling: “Alles schieb’ I os/ A </p><p>la soupt, soup el'' at the garde chambre— </p><p>that famous yeU of the Legion—when he </p><p>hunches me and wants to know where we </p><p>can buy a good meal. </p><p> Instanter my pan had gone to another</p><p>fellow and we were heading past the ser- </p><p>geant at the gate. Trust me to know where</p><p>I could get a good meal—after six months </p><p>in the Legion! </p><p> “I’ll take you to the Cafe de la Legion,”</p><p>I told him as we hurried through the yellow </p><p>sand of the streets and into the alley district. </p><p> He stuck up his nose with a wry face—</p><p>those Spanish Jews and Arabs in the Ghetto </p><p>district do smell bad—they and the filth </p><p>and the heavy, sweet odor of musk and Arab </p><p>cigarettes; and he cast a longing look back </p><p>at the better streets. </p><p> “You’re not welcome back there,” I</p><p>grinned. “All, ces malheurcux legionnaires! </p><p>I’ll take you to Chiquita’s place—Chiquita </p><p>of the Legion.” </p><p> “Chiquita?” he says. “That means</p><p>sweetheart in Spanish, don’t it?” </p><p> I nodded, and he looked at me, grinning</p><p>cynically. </p><p> “The sweetheart of the Legion,' he mur-</p><p>mured. “Is she-” _ </p><p> “No,” I cut in, “she is not. And I</p><p>added with some heat: </p><p>“She’s the sweetest, cleanest thing </p><p>Sidi-bel-Abbes. The Legion swears </p><p>her.” </p><p>in </p><p>by </p><p> He whistled, looking at me sideways, and</p><p>begged pardon. </p><p> “Tell me about her,” he says then; so I</p><p>told him about Chiquita of the Legion as </p><p>we walked through the alleys of Sidi-bel- </p><p>Abbes.	^</p><p> She was a young Spanish girl, I toldjairn,</p><p>who had been thrown on her own resources </p><p>when her daddy died mysterious!’, after </p><p>some trouble with the Algerian-French </p><p>government. Some way they’d taken his </p><p>vineyard. So she gathered together a few </p><p>chairs and tables, put up the shack which </p><p>she graced by the name of “Cafe de la </p><p>LSgion,” and started to sell coffee to the </p><p>foreign soldiers. </p><p> It wasn’t such good coffee, I pointed out,</p><p>but it was cheap. And somehow she had a </p><p>way of giving a friendly smile—even a co- </p><p>quettish smile—with each cup and still </p><p>retaining the respect of the	s.</p><p>She was the only woman in Sidi-bel-Abbes </p><p>who deemed them worthy of being treated </p><p>on terms of equality, and the Legion did </p><p>not forget. Whenever the companies were </p><p>ordered against the Arabs in the South, </p><p>many knapsacks full of loot came back </p><p>across the hot sands to Chiquita. Con- </p><p>sequently her walls were hung vrith purios, </p><p>draped about among her drawings—oh, be</p><p>would find hers an interesting place. </p><p> “You’ll find her interesting, too,” I added.</p><p>“Only be careful she don’t become too in- </p><p>teresting. We all fall in love with her now </p><p>and then—but it’s of no use. I think she’s </p><p>in love with her drawings?” </p><p> “Drawings?” he said real quick. “You</p><p>mean she does them herself?” </p><p> “Yes,” I said. “Crude pieces of work,</p><p>but very good for one who has never bad </p><p>any instruction.” </p><p> “Ha!” he exclaimed then. “This is</p><p>getting interesting. An undiscovered gen- </p><p>ius, perhaps, with beauty—surely she has </p><p>beauty—who cooks your meals and does </p><p>a crayon of you—in the city of the Foreign </p><p>Legion. Tris bicn, nton camarade—let us </p><p>hurry.” </p><p> His eyes began to sparkle, and his lips</p><p>to quirk at the corners; and after we’d taken </p><p>aboard some wine and arrived at last at </p><p>Chiquita’s, he’d begun to act like a real live- </p><p>young American who’d never “stuck up </p><p>his hand” in the Legion. </p><p>Chiquita of the Legion </p><p>79 </p><p>CHIQUITA-1 remember how </p><p>she looked that night, and how he </p><p>bowed to her in a sort of humorous </p><p>mocking way when I introduced him; and </p><p>how her eyes sparkled when she laughed </p><p>and tossed her black head at him in return. </p><p>They made a picture, those two, with us </p><p>red-trousered legionnaires in the back- </p><p>ground. I sha’n’t soon forget it. </p><p> Chiquita—she was a picture, a little</p><p>colored masterpiece; only she laughed at </p><p>you out of the canvas. She was real, </p><p>which is better than the result of a brush. </p><p>For some reason she used to affect a Moor- </p><p>ish costume without a veil—possibly be- </p><p>cause it was cooler—a sort of white-hemmed </p><p>blue overgarment that hung from her head </p><p>and over the shoulders to her ankles. Un- </p><p>derneath that was a shorter garment of </p><p>heavy purple, which in turn covered baggy </p><p>trouserlets of yellow silk caught up and </p><p>fastened at the ankle. It went well with </p><p>her olive cheeks and black eyes; she was all </p><p>color and piquancy and life sitting up there </p><p>with her little slippers poised on the rungs </p><p>of her high stool, </p><p> Riordan? He saw it, never fear. And</p><p>she saw him. Which was natural enough, </p><p>too. There aren’t many big blond Ameri- </p><p>cans come into the Legion who show un- </p><p>mistakable earmarks of culture and ur- </p><p>banity, and have blue eyes that sparkle</p><p>and red lips that curve besides. Voila! </p><p>Who made the world the way it is, anyway? </p><p> ‘This is excellently done,” he made a</p><p>beginning, going over to one of the etchings. </p><p>“And this—the touch here is very, very </p><p>good. Surely mademoiselle has been with </p><p>a master?" </p><p> Well! Did we have that meal? We did.</p><p>Chiquita was indeed glad to serve us—she </p><p>told us so—and she did, while the other </p><p>poor devils of legionnaires sat around and </p><p>envied us. The taste of that meal stuck in </p><p>my memory. </p><p> But between mouthfuls I got Riordan’s</p><p>story. It was simple enough, as was mine. </p><p>I got a berth at Bassorah on the Persian </p><p>Gulf as supercargo on the tramp Wizard </p><p>out of Seattle. A little fight ashore at </p><p>Oran tied me up with the French authori- </p><p>ties. It was either jail or the Legion. </p><p>Young Riordan, he'd had a berth spending </p><p>the old man’s money and dabbling in art </p><p>in France until the “art’’ of Monte Carlo </p><p>soaked him—that and some chit of a girl. </p><p>Instead of a bullet and a last sad note, </p><p>he decided to become a soldier of fortune. </p><p> “Lord!” he sighed. “I couldn’t see any-</p><p>thing but the governor’s face across the </p><p>pond. Then I got dreams—ye gods, </p><p>dreams-” </p><p> “Of maybe bringing a commission home</p><p>to the old man through some glor-ee-yus </p><p>deed on distant battlefield?” I filled in </p><p>the pause for him. “And they commenced </p><p>opening up your eyes even at Marseilles/ </p><p>“Don’t mention it,” he grimaced. “Let’s </p><p>have wine—red wine—I still have a little </p><p>money, at any rate. We’ll drink—we'll all </p><p>drink to the Legion. Eh—Senorita Chi- </p><p>quita?” </p><p> “To the Legion!” she laughed; and I saw</p><p>her eying him covertly from her stool when </p><p>he turned away. </p><p> She sold no wines, but for the first time</p><p>she allowed her legionnaires to send out for </p><p>it. So we made merry until time to go to </p><p>barracks. Now and then when she wasn’t </p><p>so busy she and Riordan stepped around </p><p>to the pictures, talking of “lines” and </p><p>“backgrounds” and “tones” and other </p><p>things alien to us; then Riordan got to sing- </p><p>ing songs and playing on Chiquita's guitar </p><p>to an audience that by that time crammed </p><p>the place full. Chiquita did a roaring </p><p>business that night—what time she wasn't </p><p>laughing with Riordan. </p><p> “She’s got real talent.” he told me on the</p><p>way home. “Gad! I’m quite interested.</p><p>If she only had a chance in Paris, now; or </p><p>Florence-’’ </p><p> "Most likely she never will,” I comment-</p><p>ed. </p><p> “No, I guess not.'' Then he seemed to</p><p>dismiss the matter, and started humming </p><p>a tune. </p><p> He didn’t hum a tune in the morning,</p><p>though. He got his first dose of gymnas- </p><p>tiqne des blcus, and it went as follows: </p><p>Awake just before six. Coffee in bed— </p><p>no breakfast; then reveille, sweep out from </p><p>under your bunk, get ready and fall in for </p><p>drill neatly and completely uniformed and </p><p>equipped for drill—all in ten minutes. </p><p>One button wrong meant barrack arrest, </p><p>la cellule or the Zephyrs, according to the </p><p>temper of the sergeant. Then out to the </p><p>drill grounds, and the command, “Forrn z </p><p>les faisccaux. Sac a tcrrc!" (“Lay down </p><p>your knapsacks and pile arms.”) Then, </p><p>“Pas gymnasliqud En avanll Marchs'" </p><p>Yes, that’s all. “At the double—march.” </p><p>Just that and nothing more. A run that </p><p>$0 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>is kept up, on no breakfast, for thirty-min- </p><p>ute stretches, interspersed with boxing and </p><p>Swedish gymnastics until first soup call at </p><p>ten o’clock. Lungs bursting, head split- </p><p>ting—Nom Ju ban Dieu, the Legion! It </p><p>has crumpled many a man’s lungs like </p><p>paper. </p><p> At ten Riordan dragged himself in and</p><p>threw himself on the bunk like a dead man. </p><p>He kept twisting himself from side to side </p><p>with the agony of his pumping lungs. His </p><p>face was gray and lined and old. </p><p> “My God!” he groaned. “It killed one</p><p>man this morning—hemorrhage of the </p><p>lungs.” </p><p> “They figure they have plenty more,” I</p><p>told him. </p><p> “But what’s it for?" he demanded in a</p><p>wail. </p><p> “To harden you so you can march.”</p><p> “ ‘Run,’ the corporal said, ‘run or die.’ ”</p><p> “Sure. March or die—c’est la Legion.”</p><p> “And what’s for this afternoon?”</p><p> “For you, ’ I said, "rudimentary in-</p><p>structions; for me, either a twenty-four- </p><p>kilometer march, or corvcc. Cleaning the </p><p>sewers of the Arab prison, building a villa </p><p>for some fat Levantine, piling forage for the </p><p>native Spahi cavalry. For five centimes </p><p>a day.” </p><p> “My God!” he groaned. “And that’s</p><p>■what I graduate to when I get turned for</p><p>full duty.” </p><p> He stared into space as I have seen con-</p><p>victs stare in the Death’s Row, then turned </p><p>back to me. </p><p> “Do they ever fight?” he asked.</p><p> “Sometimes.”</p><p> “Sometimes? Say—what is this Legion</p><p>for?” </p><p> “For?” I said. “My son, it is for France.</p><p>It is for students of social conditions to talk </p><p>about—and do nothing. It is for escaped </p><p>convicts. It is for hungry men who sell </p><p>their souls for five centimes a day. It is </p><p>for cheap colonization projects. It is for </p><p>building roads and cities. It is for the pro- </p><p>tection and filthy service of filthy Arabs </p><p>and harping Jews who spit on the men that </p><p>protect them. It is for fools. Work or </p><p>die, march or die, fight and die—c’est la </p><p>Legion/” </p><p> “And if you buck-</p><p> l,La cellule, the Zephyrs, or the prison</p><p>battalion.”	.</p><p> "La cellulcl” His face contorted into a</p><p>horrible grimace. “I went past the cells. </p><p>Thirty men in a room nine by twelve. I </p><p>could smell them thirty feet away.” </p><p> La gamelle went then, and we broke off.</p><p>He didn’t turn up his nose at it this time. </p><p>No. He fell on it like a wolf. </p><p> And so his life as a legionnaire began.</p><p> l'rom that time he was two distinct per-</p><p>sonalities—by day gloomy, silent, a ma- </p><p>chine, coming to life only at night. Wine, </p><p>red wine, and the sympathy of Chiquita— </p><p>he lived for the nights. And so, it seemed, </p><p>did she. He'd sing songs, and talk to her </p><p>about her pictures—oh, one could see how </p><p>things were going. If he happened to be </p><p>detained on guard, her face would fall. </p><p> Well, one night the sergeant at the gate</p><p>sent me back to repolish my shoes, and </p><p>Riordan went on ahead. It was then that </p><p>I saw with my own eyes how far things had </p><p>gone. </p><p> The sun was just setting when I left the</p><p>gate. The big molten disk swung down </p><p>back of the hook in the nearby Thessala </p><p>mountains, and its slanting rays played </p><p>over the flat roofs of Sidi-bel-Abbes like </p><p>spears from a sea of gold. I remember </p><p>how the place looked that evening; and </p><p>when I reached the Cafe de la Legion, those </p><p>two were alone in the dim interior. They </p><p>didn’t hear me. And how could they? </p><p>She was standing on tiptoe, crushed against </p><p>his breast, his lips on hers. Even th-.- dim- </p><p>ness couldn’t hide the light in her ia.ee. I</p><p>could see her tremble from ankles to head; </p><p>then her eyes closed- </p><p> I coughed, and they turned to me—she</p><p>red and sweet and confused. She ran into </p><p>the kitchen, while he and I bridged the </p><p>awkwardness over a liter of wine. But 1 </p><p>told him a few things later. </p><p> Said I:</p><p> “You’d best treat her right. She isn’t</p><p>merely Chiquita—she’s an ideal to these </p><p>men who have come to believe that there’s </p><p>no more good in the world. Treat her </p><p>wrong and they’ll tear you to pieces.” </p><p> He merely shrugged, with a remark about</p><p>handling his own affairs, so I didn't mention </p><p>it again. </p><p> Then one night some one stole the re-</p><p>mainder of his money from under his pillow. </p><p> That was the beginning of the end.</p><p>Perforce he had to stay at the barracks </p><p>more now, as he had no money to hire his </p><p>washing and polishing done. The only </p><p>time you get to do that in is after second </p><p>soup call in the evening. He'd never done </p><p>Chiquita of the Legion </p><p>81 </p><p>a day’s work in his life, and “policing up” </p><p>didn’t come natural to him; pretty soon he </p><p>got to getting into trouble with the non- </p><p>coms, and finally they soaked him two days’ </p><p>cellule for a dirty kit. </p><p> He came out of there smelling to heaven,</p><p>covered with vermin. His eyes were two </p><p>grim black, holes in a pasty ashen mask. </p><p> “It’s the last straw,” he swore. “They</p><p>ran me around with a knapsack filled with </p><p>sand on my back. God! I can hear that </p><p>corporal’s, ‘A droit—droit!’—I’ll hear it in </p><p>my dreams. I’m going.” </p><p> “Got money?” I asked.</p><p> “No!”</p><p> “Then you’re crazy. Without it you’ll</p><p>buck the desert; starvation that will drive </p><p>you to Spanish farmers who are only too </p><p>glad to give you up; the Arab gendarmes </p><p>who will turn you in for the prize-money, </p><p>and Arab tribes that will cut you up for </p><p>your clothes. Even if you pass them you </p><p>have to have papers at the ports, unless </p><p>you can smuggle aboard. Why don’t you </p><p>wait until you get money from home?” </p><p> He wouldn’t listen to the last. He</p><p>seemed afraid of his daddy. He only shook </p><p>his head, muttering to himself, then finally </p><p>took himself off to town. </p><p> “I’ll find some way,” he swore.</p><p> He did, too. He came to me an hour</p><p>later in the canteen, and took me off to one</p><p>side. His face was beaming. </p><p> “She’s going to lend me the money,” he</p><p>said, firing it all at me at once. “And get </p><p>me a suit of civilian clothes, and-” </p><p> “Hold on,” I said, leading him out of</p><p>there. “You’ll be giving this away. You </p><p>come with me down to Chiquita’s—you </p><p>two kids will need Tommy Patten to keep </p><p>your heads cool.” </p><p> “She says she’s going with me, too,” he</p><p>blurted then. </p><p> “Wait until we get there before you tell</p><p>me any more,” I said. “Then we’ll </p><p>straighten out the plans.” </p><p> Well, she confirmed what he had said</p><p>sitting there on his knee back in the lit- </p><p>tle cafe kitchen. Man, she was happy— </p><p>glancing down at him, and him looking up </p><p>now and then rather red as to face. Hers_ </p><p>the color came and went in her cheeks like </p><p> it1 gl0W-liShts of the Ranabas off</p><p>Marsel-Leroo, and every now and then the </p><p>round arms would tighten ’round his neck </p><p>with a little spasmodic jerk, and her red </p><p>lips touch all over his face in a hundred </p><p>6 </p><p>little kisses. All the while she prattled on </p><p>like a happy little kid. Thank the good </p><p>God, she said, she had saved enough to </p><p>meet this one time in her life. She had not </p><p>imagined the good God would be so good </p><p>to her. Spain—the Spain her father had </p><p>talked about—with Dick’; and an inex- </p><p>pensive little villa—oh, life had turned out </p><p>to be a wonderful thing. </p><p> At last, though, I had to cut in on her</p><p>and throw the cold water of common sense </p><p>on her outlook. They were taking grave </p><p>chances. They must take every possible </p><p>precaution against possible detection and </p><p>capture. </p><p> “That’s what I told her,” Riordan broke</p><p>in eagerly. “She wants to go with me. </p><p>They may put the two departures together </p><p>if we go, as she suggests, by carts to the </p><p>coast and then over to Spain in a hired </p><p>fishing-smack. It is best for me to take </p><p>chances on a steamer and have her follow </p><p>on another boat.” </p><p> “No!” she cried. “How do you know</p><p>what boats are in Oran? You would have </p><p>to leave there as soon as possible on the </p><p>first boat. Perhaps it would be one right </p><p>to France. With no papers—no. I will </p><p>not listen. You could not cable, for all </p><p>messages are censored here. Listen—” </p><p>and she turned in appeal to me—“see if </p><p>this is not the best plan.”</p><p> She was to take his measure, get his</p><p>clothes, then leave the cafe in charge of a </p><p>girl friend. She would then go into the </p><p>country on a visit to some trustworthy </p><p>friends of her father’s. The Arabs they </p><p>employed formerly worked for her family, </p><p>and these could easily be induced to take </p><p>them via cart train to Tjecamen, near Oran </p><p>on the coast- They would travel at night </p><p>with Dick under cover in case they met a </p><p>patrol. Three days she would wait at her </p><p>friend’s, so that there might be no con- </p><p>nection between the two departures; then </p><p>he was to come. Her Arab friends could </p><p>easily arrange with the fisherman at the </p><p>coast to take them to Spain. </p><p> “She’s right,” I told Riordan. “But</p><p>now'—what’s going to happen when you </p><p>get to Spain?” </p><p> She buried her face in his neck so quick</p><p>I could not see his eyes. </p><p> “What but one thing?” he retorted.</p><p>“We’ll be married; then I’ll cable the </p><p>governor that I’m off to a new' start. He'll </p><p>come across then, I’m sure.” </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “H’m,” I said. “Why don’t you get</p><p>married here?" </p><p> He looked out from behind her shoulder</p><p>pretty quickly at that. </p><p> “Whyl” he exclaimed. “That would</p><p>expose us sure. .No one could help putting </p><p>the two departures together then. Find </p><p>one, find the other.” </p><p> I had to admit that he was right, but on</p><p>the way home I put my hand on his arm </p><p>and stopped him. </p><p> “That girl is risking her savings, and</p><p>running chances of the prison battalion for </p><p>helping a legionnaire desert,” I said—“for </p><p>you.” </p><p> “She won't have it any other way,” he</p><p>muttered. </p><p> “No,” I said. “She won’t. She’s that</p><p>kind. The governor won’t have any cause </p><p>to be ashamed of the kind of grandchildren </p><p>she’s going to bring him—if she does.” </p><p> “I wish she’d listen to coming on another</p><p>boat,’’ he muttered in a troubled tone. </p><p> “She’s got the best plan,” I said. “Best</p><p>come on now and go to sleep.” </p><p> The next morning we heard that Chiquita</p><p>would be gone for a time from the Cafe. </p><p>We knew then the first move was on. But </p><p>during the next three days Riordan was so </p><p>fidgety I had to keep an eye on him for fear </p><p>he'd forget some part of his uniform and </p><p>get thrown into cells again. He fretted</p><p>himself about a possible slip here and a slip </p><p>there until he had me on the raw edge </p><p>myself. </p><p>FINALLY, though, the night came. </p><p>And how he did polish and primp to </p><p>make sure of passing inspection at </p><p>the gate! I had to warn him for fear his </p><p>very eagerness would warn the corporal of </p><p>our squad that something unusual was </p><p>afoot, and had to shake him up again </p><p>when we got beyond the gate. </p><p> “Don’t run,” I scolded. “Stroll along</p><p>like I do. I'll lead you out all right.” </p><p>“Oh!” he said. “Are you going beyond </p><p>the walls?” </p><p> “Certainly.”</p><p> “But if they catch you-”</p><p> “Pouf! Two days’ barracks arrest for</p><p>stealing grapes. You need me. You’re </p><p>too excited.”	j</p><p> “I’m afraid you'll be caught, he insisted;</p><p>but I wouldn’t listen. </p><p> So we made for the city walls by alley</p><p>routes, slipped by a patrol, and went up </p><p>and over and away through the vineyards. </p><p>1 couldn’t hold him back then—he hit </p><p>up the Legions’ double time, and I had </p><p>to follow. </p><p> We made those two miles in no time,</p><p>keeping in the shadows as much as possible. </p><p>Then we heard a swift rustling of soft gar- </p><p>ments, and Chiquita was in his arms. </p><p> I let her have him a minute; but time was</p><p>precious. I saw the shadowy carts and </p><p>Arabs waiting near by. I urged him to </p><p>hurry. </p><p> “Change quickly,” I told him, “and</p><p>bring back every piece of your uniform so </p><p>I can see that it finds its way to the quarter- </p><p>master. If you get caught you don’t want </p><p>to be tried for stealing your kit.” </p><p> He slipped into the shadows, and Chi-</p><p>quita ran to me and clutched at my arm. </p><p>I was so good to help—she would never </p><p>forget—surely the good God would not </p><p>allow him to be caught. </p><p> “Tut, tut,” 1 said, “everything is going</p><p>to be all right.” I assured her that L was </p><p>confident they would make it all right. </p><p> That is what I told her—but I sfca’n't</p><p>soon forget standing there with i-hat Ctrl </p><p>all atremble beside me. It isn’t any too </p><p>pleasant playing a sort of helpless iViter- </p><p>father to a young girl that’s sincere : r.d </p><p>true and good and playing a game for her </p><p>lover with all her possessions and freedom </p><p>at stake. No, it isn’t so pleasant—es- </p><p>pecially when you feel all her fears and</p><p>anxieties, and being a man and older, and </p><p>wiser, you see t\ lot more she hasn’t guessed </p><p>at as yet. She was that close to me—the </p><p>trembling of her hands—the faint, sweet </p><p>odor that came from her hair- </p><p> Then, after an age, Riordan appeared.</p><p>She ran to meet him and then walked back </p><p>with him toward me. </p><p> My eyes were on him, inspecting. The</p><p>clothes weren’t any too good, being second- </p><p>hand; si ill they fi tted well enough as far </p><p>as I could see. But I wasn’t noticing that </p><p>as much as something that was making </p><p>itself felt in his manner—something that </p><p>chilled me; and when he handed me his </p><p>uniform bundle with a remark about his </p><p>new shoes hurting his feet, a strange silence </p><p>fell on us all—a silence that made me sick </p><p>at heart. </p><p> She, too, felt it. She looked up at him,</p><p>wide-eyed. </p><p> “What is it?” she whispered.</p><p> “Chiquita,” he said, and stopped. His</p><p>Chiquita of the Legion </p><p>83 </p><p>voice was strange and husky. Then— </p><p>“I found the money in the clothes.” </p><p> “Yes, yes, five hundred francs. You</p><p>must handle the purse now.” </p><p> “But I want that you should take half</p><p>of it. I-” </p><p> He paused, then went on with a rush:</p><p> “I have been thinking about this all</p><p>along. It is not best that we go together. </p><p>I can go on to one of the up-country stations </p><p>and then to Oran by rail—oh, I’ll make </p><p>it all right — I’ll cable you when I am </p><p>safe.” </p><p> I remained silent. I was not amazed,</p><p>for I had been halfway expecting this; but </p><p>I looked at her. She stared at him in utter </p><p>unbelief—it was as if he had struck her a </p><p>blow. </p><p> Never have I seen greater misery depicted</p><p>in a human face. She had guessed the </p><p>truth at last. There was at least some- </p><p>thing honest enmeshed in the bottom of </p><p>the boy. His face and eyes were poor liars </p><p>even if his words did evade. He had never </p><p>intended to take her with him. </p><p> “Dick!” she cried very low. I can hear</p><p>it yet. It had sadder notes than the Wongo </p><p>lament of the women on Leno-La-Nee. </p><p> A great anger seized me then.</p><p> “You cur!” I choked; and was on him</p><p>like a wolf. </p><p> Big he was, but he stood no show with</p><p>me in that ;rage. He went ,'dowrn, fighting,</p><p>but with me on top, my bayonet at his </p><p>throat. </p><p> Then Chiquita grabbed my arm.</p><p> “No!” she screamed. “No! Would</p><p>you-” </p><p> “No, I’ll not kill him,” I said. “But I’ll</p><p>make him put on that uniform again and </p><p>go back to barracks.” And I tightened </p><p>my grip on his throat. </p><p> H’m. . . Yes, Haig and Haig, Willard.</p><p>Four fingers. . . Yes. . . </p><p> Well, I expect you’re wondering what</p><p>came next. I didn’t think she’d want me </p><p>to hurt him—that’s a woman’s way—but </p><p>I wasn’t prepared for what followed.* </p><p> “Let him up,’ she said, and her voice wras</p><p>that strange and quiet I did so in a sort of </p><p>trance. I have heard the same tones in the </p><p>voices of priests when they give the abso- </p><p>lution. </p><p> He got up stiffly, with a murderous look</p><p>at me, but stood still—her voice held him, </p><p>too. So they remained, she looking at him as </p><p>if she couldn’t look enough; then she spoke. </p><p> “You do not know what love is,” she</p><p>told him. “Some day you may learn. I </p><p>will always love you, no matter what you </p><p>do. No—” to me as I tried to speak— </p><p>“you must let him go. Five years—for </p><p>him—in the Legion? Nom du bon Dieu, </p><p>it would kill him. No! You must keep </p><p>the money—Dick. Now please go!” </p><p> Yes, that’s what that little girl said to</p><p>him out there under the stars in that Al- </p><p>gerian night. A girl that was born in the </p><p>provinces and had never seen her native </p><p>Spain. A girl born near—Beard of the </p><p>Prophet—the Foreign Legion! Yes. And </p><p>even in the temperate zone you get to think- </p><p>ing that all that’s good and noble is pic- </p><p>tured on the stage. </p><p> As for him, he mumbled something—he</p><p>couldn’t talk—and stumbled off through </p><p>the darkness, while she watched him, still </p><p>and dry-eyed. </p><p> No, she didn’t break down. If she did,</p><p>she kept it from me. </p><p> Ah! One needs a drink, remembering a</p><p>scene like that. A little more ice, Willard. </p><p>Thanks. . . It sticks in the memory. . . </p><p> Well—it stuck in his memory, too. Yes,</p><p>he made it all right. Made it to Florence </p><p>and the American colony. Quite a group </p><p>of artist friends, he found. And he cabled </p><p>his father, who, instead of sending him </p><p>money, came a-footing on the next boat to </p><p>take care of that prodigal son. Wouldn’t </p><p>trust him until he’d seen him. The boy</p><p>’fessed up then and made a clean breast of </p><p>the whole affair. </p><p> Then he wTote me.</p><p> No, I w'on’t tell you what he wrote. He</p><p>sent me the money with which I later made </p><p>my getaway. But I won't tell you what </p><p>he wrote. I wouldn’t want a man to tell </p><p>what T said if I penned him a letter straight </p><p>from the bottom of my heart, like that boy </p><p>did. Doggoned if it didn’t make me feel </p><p>almost as good as Chiquita did when he </p><p>wrote to her. </p><p> Yes, he saw his mistake. A little time</p><p>away from her had opened his eyes. He </p><p>sent for her. They’re up there now in a </p><p>villa, daubing at pictures together. Those </p><p>two, and the kid- </p><p> What? You thought the yam was going</p><p>to have an unhappy ending. Why- </p><p> I must have been in love with her, then?</p><p>You’re a liar! </p><p>ID </p><p>CHAPTER I </p><p>WATSON HEARS HIS CALL </p><p>[ID you ever kill a man?" </p><p> The question came quietly out</p><p>of a long silence. The younger </p><p>man looked up quickly from the </p><p>crackling camp-fire, his eyes searching his </p><p>partner’s grave face for an explanation of </p><p>the strangely dull note in his voice. . </p><p> “No, Johnny. I never killed a man.</p><p>Why?” </p><p> Johnny Watson made no answer for a lit-</p><p>tle as he drew thoughtfully upon his pipe. </p><p>The little, drying mountain stream upon </p><p>which they had camped for the night went </p><p>singing on its way under the stars. </p><p> Neither of the two men so much as stirred</p><p>until after the younger man had almost for- </p><p>gotten the abrupt question, and was think- </p><p>ing upon the bed he had made of willow </p><p>branches, when Johnny Watson took the </p><p>pipe from between his lips, ran a brown </p><p>hand across the grizzled stub of his ragged </p><p>mustache and continued in the same ex- </p><p>pressionless monotone: </p><p> “I have. Three of ’em. One close to</p><p>thirty years ago, Dick. A sailor, he was; </p><p>and a sailor of a sort I was, too, in those </p><p>days. Down where the South Seas is used </p><p>to man-killing. I had a little money, a good </p><p>deal for a sailorman to have all at one </p><p>time, sewed in a bit of canvas in my shirt. </p><p>Ben, he had been drunk and was mean and </p><p>reckless, or I guess he wouldn’t V done it </p><p>—Ben was a decent man after his fashion. </p><p> “He come up behind with a knife. I saw</p><p>his shadow, and 1 give it to him across the </p><p>temple with a bit of scrap-iron laying on </p><p>the little pier. Pie died two days later. </p><p> “One was twenty years gone now. They</p><p>called him DeVine, and he was the cr&lt; &lt; k- </p><p>edest man that ever put on white man’s </p><p>clothes. It began with cards, and ended </p><p>with him trying to do me on a mine. He </p><p>knowed when 1 had caught him. and pulled </p><p>his gun first. He missed me about six </p><p>inches, and we wasn’t standing more than </p><p>seven feet apart. . . . </p><p> “And one was something more than eight</p><p>years ago. He was no account. He mur- </p><p>dered old Tom Richards. Tom was a pard- </p><p>ncr of mine. Tom's body wasn’t cold yet </p><p>when the man as murdered him went to </p><p>plead his case with the Great Judge.” </p><p> Again the deep stillness of the mountains</p><p>shut in about them. Young Dick Farley </p><p>stared curiously into his partner’s face, </p><p>wondering. And since the ways of the cities </p><p>of the earth were not forgotten by him, the </p><p>ways of men, where judges and courts and </p><p>written laws were not, were new to him—be </p><p>shivered slightly. </p><p> For two years he and the man who was</p><p>speaking quietly of the murderous killing </p><p>of men, and the killing of men in retribution, </p><p>had lived together in that close fraternity </p><p>for which the West has coined the word </p><p>“pardncrship” from a colder word; and </p><p>84 </p><p>beyond the law </p><p>A Complete Novelette </p><p> bi/</p><p> OO</p><p> Jackson</p><p> Grejo%</p><p> Author of “The Crimson</p><p> Mask," “The Red Laic."</p><p>Beyond the Law </p><p>85 </p><p>never had he heard old Johnny Watson </p><p>talk as he did tonight. And still he </p><p>waited for the man to go on, knowing that </p><p>there was some reason for this unasked con- </p><p>fidence. </p><p> “There’s some things a man can explain,”</p><p>went on Watson. “There’s a Lord’s sight </p><p>more he can’t. When you’ve lived as long </p><p>as I have, Dickie, alone a big three-fourths </p><p>of the time, maybe you’ll be like me and </p><p>not try to look under things for the why </p><p>so long’s you know the what. </p><p> “I know now you and me are on the like-</p><p>liest trail I ever put one foot down in front </p><p>of the other on. And I know it’s my last</p><p>trail! It’s ‘So long’ for you and me, pard- </p><p>ner. And I’m going to know real soon </p><p>what’s on the other side of things.” </p><p> Dick Farley sought a light rejoinder with</p><p>which to meet an old miner’s superstition, </p><p>but he could find no words. So again there </p><p>was silence between them until Watson </p><p>once more spoke: </p><p> “I killed them three men in fair fight,</p><p>Dickie, and with the right o’ things on my </p><p>side. And it ain’t ever once bothered me. </p><p>And now the funny part of it—I ain’t so </p><p>much as thought of one of them men for a </p><p>month. </p><p> “You know we got too much to think</p><p>about, you and me, with the trail leading us </p><p>straight to more gold—our gold—than </p><p>would sink a battle-ship. And today? Well, </p><p>when the sun shines in ray eyes, and I wake </p><p>up slow, I’m kinder dazed for a little while, </p><p>and while I can’t get my bearings I’m back </p><p>in the South Sea country with Ben, the </p><p>sailorman. Just as plain as I’m seeing you </p><p>now, Dick, I saw him. Twisted thumb and </p><p>all—and I hadn’t thought about that </p><p>twisted thumb from that day over thirty </p><p>years ago until this very morning! And </p><p>all day I’ve been walking first with Ben </p><p>and then with Flash DeVine, and then with </p><p>Perry Parker, as did for poor old Tom </p><p>Richards.” </p><p> HE BROKE off suddenly, sitting</p><p>lurched forward, his eyes medita- </p><p>tively upon the fire. Then he con- </p><p>tinued: </p><p> “A man that didn’t know would think it</p><p>was all nonsense. But most men that live in </p><p>the way-out places of the earth, and who’ve </p><p>took men off, fair and square—or with a </p><p>knife from behind; it makes no difference— </p><p>would know what I know. I don’t know </p><p>the why, pardner. And I don’t care why. </p><p>You'll be looking for a new side-kick before </p><p>Summer dies.” </p><p> Dick stirred uneasily. Again he sought</p><p>for a light, bantering reply. But the words </p><p>did not come. A strange sense of fatality </p><p>had crept slowly over him. </p><p> He tried to tell himself that he was listen-</p><p>ing to the expression of an old miner’s </p><p>superstition, that the thing was an absurd- </p><p>ity. And while he refused to give credence </p><p>to a thing which he could not understand, </p><p>he had an odd sense that he and Johnny </p><p>Watson were not alone. Unconsciously he </p><p>drew a bit closer to the fire and to the man </p><p>who was “seeing things.” </p><p> “And this here the likeliest trail I ever</p><p>set foot down on,” said the older man, </p><p>with nothing but a vague regret in the </p><p>even tones. “Just two more days and </p><p>we’re there—maybe together and may- </p><p>be you finish the trail alone, pardner. </p><p>It’s a month ago I picked up that first big </p><p>yellow lump. The whole mountainside is </p><p>rotten with gold! .And then I come back </p><p>and picked you up like we’d said we would, </p><p>you wearing your shoes out on flinty rocks </p><p>where a man wouldn’t find a color in seven </p><p>lifetime;. And now we’re in two days of it, </p><p>and-” </p><p> He didn't finish, breaking off with a long-</p><p>drawn, deep breath. His pipe had gone out </p><p>and he leaned forward, picking up a blazing </p><p>bit of dry pine which he beld to the black- </p><p>ened bowl. Dick Farley noticed that the </p><p>bronzed, lined face was very calm, the eyes </p><p>somewhat wider opened than usual, the </p><p>fingers upon the fagot as steady as should </p><p>be the fingers of a man without nerves. </p><p> “Johnny—” Farley was speaking at last,</p><p>with an effort, keeping his tones as steady </p><p>as his partner's—“j'ou are right when you </p><p>say that there are some things which we </p><p>can’t explain. But it’s up to us to explain </p><p>what we can, isn’t it? You haven't thought </p><p>of those men for a long time, and now they </p><p>flash up before you all of a sudden, and clear. </p><p>Can’t it be that I have happened to use </p><p>some expression that Ben used, or that some </p><p>sound from the woods about us, or some smell </p><p>or even an odd color in the sunset-’’ </p><p> “That’s like you, Dickie. Fight until</p><p>you’re in the last ditch, and then go on </p><p>fighting!” Watson shook his head. "No, </p><p>that ain’t the right explanation this trip. </p><p>I’ve seen them three men today. I've </p><p>seen Flash DeVine jerk up his hiad with </p><p>86 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>a little i'unnv sort of twist to the left like </p><p>he always used to, and I've seen the red </p><p>spot by Parker’s ear. I’d clean forgot them </p><p>little things. Dick. No, pard’. There's no </p><p>use trying to explain. I got to thinking </p><p>about it this noon while you was staking out </p><p>the horses, and I made a little drawing you </p><p>can use it I pass out before we get to the </p><p>place. It’s on a dgareet paper, and I poked </p><p>it inside old Shaggy’s saddle-blanket. And </p><p>now, boy—” standing up, his shoulders </p><p>lilted and squared—“good night. If it hap- </p><p>pens I don’t see you any more-” </p><p> He put out his hand suddenly. Young</p><p>Dick Farley gulped down a lump in his </p><p>throat as he gripped Johnny Watson's</p><p>lingers. For a moment they stared into </p><p>each other’s eyes—then Watson turned </p><p>away abruptly and with no other word went </p><p>to his blankets. </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>FORWARD </p><p>TT WAS Johnny Watson’s voice swear- </p><p>ing at old Shaggy that awoke Dick </p><p>Farley in the early dawn. Farley stared up- </p><p>ward through the still tree-tops at the gray </p><p>morning, his mind groping for the unpleas- </p><p>ant something of last night. And when he </p><p>remembered he smiled, thinking how he </p><p>would chaff his partner about his night fears </p><p>and his dead men. </p><p> But when he caught a swift glimpse of</p><p>the deep-set eyes under the shaggy gray- </p><p>sprinkled brows, the bantering remarks </p><p>which were trooping to the end of his tongue </p><p>were left unuttered. In a blind sort of way </p><p>he realized that the thing which had come </p><p>upon Johnny Watson yesterday had not left </p><p>him. Those eyes were looking out upon </p><p>death calmly, expectantly, a bit reluctantly, </p><p>but not with fear and not with rebellion. </p><p>Farley said nothing as he turned away and </p><p>wxnt down into the creek-bed to wash his </p><p>hands and face. </p><p> Over their breakfast of coffee, bacon and</p><p>flapjacks the two men talked lightly of this </p><p>and that, with no mention of last night. </p><p>When Watson had finished he began speak- </p><p>ing of the day’s work into ihe cafion. He </p><p>told briefly where they would leave the </p><p>creek in three or four hours, where the)' </p><p>would find water for the noon camp, where </p><p>more water and grass for the evening camp. </p><p>“Tonight—we ought to be there by six— </p><p>we get over the ridge and into the Devil’s </p><p>Pocket country. There’s just one way to </p><p>get out of that country, Dick, and that’s the </p><p>way we’re going in. If a man looks for a </p><p>short cut, if he goes skallyhootmg east or </p><p>west, north or south of the place where our </p><p>trail is going to cut into the basin there, </p><p>he’s a goner. </p><p> “If you leave this trail on the way back</p><p>you’re going to run out of water first thing, </p><p>and your horse is going to break his leg, if it </p><p>ain’t his neck, the next thing; and then you </p><p>die because you can’t pick up another water- </p><p>hole. 1 was in that country more’n a dozen </p><p>years ago. There was three of us. Me being </p><p>lucky in them days, I got out. The others </p><p>didn’t. And I ain't never been back until I </p><p>took a whirl at it last month." </p><p> The morning sun had not yet peeped</p><p>down into the steep-walled ravine in which</p><p>their course lay when the two men led their </p><p>pack-horses out of its shadows, along the </p><p>higher bank upon the right, and ■;;. n the </p><p>little bench land there. They moved </p><p>swiftly, with long swinging strides, and a^ </p><p>Watson had said, within three or four hours </p><p>they left the creek entirely, moved east- </p><p>ward through a cut in the mountains which </p><p>rose steeply against them, and found what </p><p>might once have been a trail. </p><p> Conversation had died. Watson was in</p><p>the lead, at times hidden from his compan- </p><p>ion a hundred yards in advance. Then </p><p>came the two horses. And in the rear, his </p><p>brain leaping from the talk of last night to </p><p>Watson’s accounts of the place where ‘‘the </p><p>whole side of the mountain was rotten with </p><p>gold,” to wondering about this Devil’s </p><p>Pocket, Dick Farley followed silently. </p><p> They camped a little at noon by a spring</p><p>which Watson had marked upon his map, </p><p>and rested for a couple of hours. The older </p><p>man, unostentatiously and without effort at </p><p>concealment, unlimbered the two heavy re- </p><p>volvers at his belt and looked to them as a </p><p>man does when he expects he will use them. </p><p> ‘‘The cards ain’t played yet, Dick,” he</p><p>said. “And if it don't come too onexpectcd, </p><p>we’re going to give ’em a run for their </p><p>money, old timer.” </p><p> During the silent hours of the afternoon</p><p>Farley strove to keep his partner always in </p><p>sight, hurrying up the lagging horses, keeping </p><p>them at Watson’s heels. And. although he </p><p>still told himself that he did not and would </p><p>not believe in this senseless superstition, he </p><p>carried all day a forty-five-caliber Colt. </p><p>Beyond the Law </p><p>87 </p><p>ALL day they drove steadily into the </p><p>mountains. For ahead of them was </p><p>the thing which had called to them </p><p>across the miles of wilderness, which, since </p><p>the world was young, had drawn men into </p><p>hardship, exile and often enough to death— </p><p>soft, yellow, crumbling gold! And it was </p><p>almost eight, and dark in the narrow pass, </p><p>when Watson called out and Farley pushed </p><p>by the horses to his side and looked on the </p><p>site for their camp—“the last camp this side </p><p>the strike.” </p><p> It was a spring which bubbled out clear</p><p>and cold upon a little flat hardly bigger than </p><p>the barroom at the Eagle Hotel. And </p><p>oddly, there was no creek flowing from it to </p><p>mark its whereabouts. For the water ran a </p><p>scant ten feet westward and sank into a </p><p>great fissure in the rock.</p><p> “We’ll eat first,” said Watson when the</p><p>two men had drunk. “The moon’ll be </p><p>up pretty quick. Then I’ll show you some- </p><p>thing—what the Devil’s Pocket country </p><p>looks like.” </p><p> The day had died slowly. It did not</p><p>grow dark, for with the rising evening </p><p>breeze the full moon climbed up through a </p><p>tangle of fir-tops and barren peaks, its strong </p><p>white light driving all but the most valiant </p><p>stars from the sky. Watson knocked the </p><p>dead ashes out of his pipe and got to his feet. </p><p> “Come ahead, Dick. We’ll take a look at</p><p>where we’re going. Where a good many </p><p>men have been—and not many come back.” </p><p>They climbed from the trail along a spine </p><p>of rock to a black spire, rising clear of the </p><p>scanty brush. To the very top of the sloping </p><p>rock they worked their cautious way until </p><p>their two gaunt bodies stood outlined </p><p>against the sky. Here they found footing, </p><p>and here Watson stood with arm flung out, </p><p>pointing. Dick Farley was not unused to </p><p>the thousand moods of the mountain places, </p><p>and yet as his eyes ran along the pointing </p><p>arm, and beyond it eagerly, he muttered his </p><p>startled admiration. </p><p> The moon, full, round and yellow, had</p><p>floated clear of the distant ridges and hung </p><p>in rich splendor above a long, narrow, twist- </p><p>ing valley, the Devil’s Pocket. Trees, hills, </p><p>peaks and ravines stood out in the soft light, </p><p>black and without detail. The floor of the </p><p>winding valley took upon itself many shift- </p><p>ing shades, a dark silver-gray here where </p><p>there was a strip of sandy soil, a more som- </p><p>ber splotch there where the willows followed </p><p>a thin thread of a stream. </p><p> “There she is!” W’atson exclaimed. ‘‘That</p><p>thread of willows marks the only creek in </p><p>the valley. It runs from a big spring like </p><p>ours here, and the lake drinks it up. They </p><p>call the lake ‘The Last Drink.’ We’ll walk </p><p>fifteen minutes before we get to it. We hit </p><p>the southeast shore just about where you see </p><p>that little bay with the cliffs coming down </p><p>close. There’s a trail along the base of </p><p>them cliffs; we follow that worse'n six miles </p><p>fu’ther. And when we're there, Dickie boy, </p><p>we’re right on top of the biggest gold- </p><p>mine-” </p><p> His voice broke off sharply, and he</p><p>turned his back to it all. Dick heard him </p><p>move back down to the trail. With his eyes </p><p>filled with the panorama below him Dick’s </p><p>thoughts drew back from the trail and the </p><p>ore at the end of it and followed the man </p><p>who had found the thing, the precious thing</p><p>which they had so long sought, and who </p><p>had turned back for his partner that he, </p><p>too, might have his share. </p><p> And again he told himself that his fears</p><p>of last night, which had been growing all </p><p>day, were groundless, senseless—that John- </p><p>ny Watson could not be in danger of death. </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>FARLEY MAKES A VOW </p><p>T&gt;EFORE he climbed down the way </p><p>Watson had gone, Dick Farley again </p><p>turned his eyes along the trail which was </p><p>to lead him tomorrow to the Cup of Gold. </p><p>His wandering fancies built a golden dream </p><p>future. Then he turned back and climbed </p><p>slowly down to the trail. </p><p> The fire was dying upon the little rocky</p><p>ledge where he had built it an hour ago. </p><p>Beyond the camp-fire, where he had flung </p><p>his blanket at the base of the cliff, Johnny </p><p>Watson was already lying. Farlcv swept </p><p>up his own blanket from the ground and, </p><p>stepping around the fire, flung it down close </p><p>to Watson's. </p><p> “I don’t believe in your premonitions,</p><p>pardner,” he said with a little laugh “But </p><p>if they get one of us they'll have to take </p><p>two. Here’s where I pitch my tent." </p><p> Johnny W’atson made no answer. He</p><p>was already asleep. Johnny never wasted </p><p>time in wakefulness when he had turn- </p><p>ed in. </p><p> Farley straightened out his blankets,</p><p>jerked off his heavy boots and socks and lay </p><p>88 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>down, his elbow close to Watson's. And </p><p>so he went to sleep. </p><p> Something awoke him; it might have</p><p>been the moon, shining lull in his lace. He </p><p>rolled over upon his side, shifted his wide- </p><p>brimmed hat lo shield his lace from the </p><p>light, and still he did not go back to sleep. </p><p>He felt restless, uneasy—inexplicably un- </p><p>easy. Those confounded things Johnny </p><p>had said last night wouldn’t leave him. </p><p>There was no sound; not a ripple upon the </p><p>surface of the night’s silence save the mur- </p><p>mur and trickle of the water. He should </p><p>be able to hear the horses—the chain on old </p><p>Shaggy’s halter. </p><p> He sat up. Doing so, he put his right</p><p>hand on the ground beside him, beside </p><p>Johnny Watson. He felt something damp, </p><p>spongy, and sticky. He lifted his hand, </p><p>staring at it in the moonlight. There was </p><p>a dark stain. He put it to his nostrils. </p><p> ‘‘Good God!” he cried aloud. ‘‘Johnny!</p><p>Johnny!” </p><p> And then when Johnny Watson did not</p><p>answer, he did not need to look. He knew </p><p>Johnny Watson was dead—dead at the side </p><p>of his partner who had slept! </p><p> The young man staggered to his feet and</p><p>stared wildly around. Each rock and tree </p><p>and bush stood out clearly in the moonlight </p><p>with its shadow1 flung out very dark and </p><p>very distinct. His revolver was rigid in </p><p>the tense steel of his grip. There was noth- </p><p>ing, there was no one. And yet, while he </p><p>slept, some one had crept upon his partner. </p><p> He turned to where Watson lav. And</p><p>suddenly, as he saw how the man was ly- </p><p>ing, the way an arm lay at his side, the </p><p>other arm flung out, the truth came upon </p><p>him; and without looking at the wound he </p><p>knew that death had not come upon Wat- </p><p>son while the two men lay side by side. </p><p> It had come while Farley stood alone</p><p>upon the top of the cliff staring out into </p><p>Devil's Pocket, dreaming! For as Watson </p><p>lay now, so had he lain when Farley camc </p><p>down to him. He had been dead when his </p><p>partner called to him, saying they would </p><p>sleep side by side! </p><p> “While I was up on the rock,” Farley</p><p>muttered dully, “they got him. </p><p> He stooped low over the prostrate body</p><p>and gently, tenderly, he moved it so that it </p><p>lay face-up. The moonlight showed well </p><p>how Johnny Watson’s death had found him. </p><p>At the side of his bared neck was a cut such </p><p>as a broad-bladed knife would make, a great </p><p>gash, two inches long. Just one blow Lad </p><p>been struck, j\ist one such blow needed. </p><p> Farley got slowly lo his feet and for a lit-</p><p>tle stood looking down into the dead man’s </p><p>face. And the face of the man who looked </p><p>into the dead eyes was as oddly quiet and </p><p>calm. </p><p> ‘‘They got you, Johnny,” Farley was say-</p><p>ing in a voice void of expression, "with me </p><p>in calling distance— Oh, Johnny!” </p><p> For a moment he stood, his face sunk</p><p>into his two brown hands. And then sud- </p><p>denly he whirled about, his head Lifted, his </p><p>arm dung out, shaken with a frenzy of rage. </p><p> "My pardner — you've murdered my</p><p>pardner!” he shouted. ‘‘And I'm going to </p><p>lind you out! I’m going to kill you!" </p><p> Then he suddenly calmed as he realized</p><p>that he was alone in the mountains, a week’s </p><p>travel from the nearest mining-camp, alone </p><p>with his dead partner. He moved back </p><p>from the ledge and into the shadow, where </p><p>he sat down upon a broken boulder. All</p><p>once a thing which he had forgotten swept </p><p>back over him—the horses! He had missed </p><p>the noise of their crunching, he had failed </p><p>to hear the jingle of old Shaggy’s tie-chain! </p><p> He sprang to his feet and ran down into</p><p>the little clearing where they had tied the </p><p>two pack-animals. They were gone . I oth </p><p>gone. He stumbled over one of the pack- </p><p>saddles with its load. There had been no </p><p>time to take that. But the other, old </p><p>Shaggy’s saddle, was missing. </p><p> Slowly he made his way back to the lit-</p><p>tle ledge where Johnny Watson lay. Again </p><p>he sat down upon the bit of boulder, and </p><p>lighting his pipe pulled at it steadily, staring </p><p>down into the quiet canon. He could not </p><p>follow tracks until morning. </p><p>WITH the tirst glint of the new day </p><p>he buried johnny Watson. </p><p> For a moment Dick stood hat in</p><p>hand, looking at the little mound of earth </p><p>which he had made and piled high with </p><p>stones. And then he turned and, walking </p><p>swiftly, strode back to the spot where the </p><p>horses had been staked. </p><p> There was no difficulty in picking up the</p><p>trail. Upon that rugged, rocky mountain- </p><p>side the murderer, if he had taken the two </p><p>horses with him, must have moved east- </p><p>ward and into the Devil's Pocket, or in a </p><p>direction leading southwesterly over the </p><p>trail which Farley and Watson had come </p><p>yesterday. He could not have scaled the </p><p>Beyond the Law </p><p>89 </p><p>cliffs above, he could have made no prog- </p><p>ress through the dense brush of the deep- </p><p>cut ravine below. </p><p> For a moment Farley hesitated between</p><p>going forward toward the little mountain </p><p>valley and turning back. Then the thought </p><p>came to him that he could hope to learn </p><p>what he sought to know by going forward, </p><p>quicker than by swinging back toward the </p><p>southwest. For if the two horses had gone </p><p>eastward, it would be easier to pick up their </p><p>trail than upon the path which they had </p><p>cut up yesterday. If there should be any </p><p>fresh tracks leading into the Devil’s Pocket, </p><p>that would settle it. And not ten minutes </p><p>later, having followed the stony trail until </p><p>it dipped a little into a bit of soft soil in a </p><p>hollow, he found the tracks—fresh tracks </p><p>made by two shod horses. </p><p> Then he went back to last night’s camp,</p><p>made himself a small pack of bacon and </p><p>coffee and flour; and taking no useless thing, </p><p>no blanket even to interfere with the free</p><p>swing of his body, he turned east and struck </p><p>out swiftly. </p><p> He followed the trail for a mile, saw how</p><p>it wound in and out, climbing and dipping, </p><p>worming slowly toward the pocket. And </p><p>then, when he had been assured that the </p><p>tw'O horses were ahead of him, he left the </p><p>trail and fought his way due east, up the </p><p>face of a steep bank and to the crest of the </p><p>bleak mountains. He remembered Watson </p><p>had told him that following the trail they </p><p>would have to go a good fifteen miles to </p><p>travel ten, and now he sought a short-cut </p><p>to head off the man he followed. He knew </p><p>that he would pick up the trail again in the </p><p>valley. </p><p> Hour after hour he trudged on, his face</p><p>whipped by tangled brambles in the canons, </p><p>his hands torn by the crags over which he </p><p>continued to climb toward the top of the </p><p>ridge. </p><p> At last, about the middle of the forenoon,</p><p>he came to the top of the narrow divide. </p><p>From an out jutting crag he looked down </p><p>into the valley before him, seeing again the </p><p>winding course of the creek, the little lake, </p><p>the steep mountain walls and gorges Here </p><p>he stopped long enough to choose the way </p><p>he must go to make the best time. And </p><p>then with one long look back toward the </p><p>slope where the lone cedar flung its twisted </p><p>branches over his partner, he turned again </p><p>eastward and plunged down into the steep </p><p>canon, down into the Devil’s Pocket. </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>FARLEY TAKES A TUMBLE </p><p>ON THE floor of the Devil’s Pocket </p><p>Dick Farley came upon the trail again </p><p>as he had foreseen. Where it ran from the </p><p>ridges across the creek he found tracks. He </p><p>drank first and then studied them. And </p><p>slowly there came a frown into his eyes, </p><p>and then a look of pain. </p><p> For there were the tracks of one horse,</p><p>and of a man’s boot-heels in the soft wet </p><p>soil—tracks a month old, the tracks which </p><p>Johnny Watson had left when he drew out </p><p>of the valley to find his partner. </p><p> Back and forth Farley moved, stepping</p><p>slowly by the side of the path, searcidng </p><p>long and carefully for the fresh signs to teil </p><p>him that two horses had passed here during </p><p>the night or in the early morning. He did </p><p>not find them. But a moment later, at the </p><p>very edge of the stream, close to the spot </p><p>where he had just flung himself down to </p><p>drink, he found that another man had lain </p><p>there drinking. He saw the prints of the</p><p>heavy boots, saw that they had come from </p><p>the west; that the man had crossed the </p><p>stream here, stepping over the mere thread </p><p>of water, and had pushed on toward the </p><p>northern end of the valley. And the horses? </p><p> Dick had no doubt this was the man he</p><p>sought. For some reason he had left the </p><p>horses in the hills, hidden in some steep- </p><p>walled canon. </p><p> Again Farley pushed on, following the</p><p>trail, seeing now and again the outline of </p><p>the heavy boots where the soil was moist </p><p>or dusty. In a little he ceased to look for </p><p>the tracks, excepting at long intervals, for </p><p>they led straight ahead, keeping to the path </p><p>through the win- grass, straight toward the </p><p>lake. At noon he stopped to eat and smoke </p><p>his pipe. And then again he pushed on. </p><p> He was tired now, but be gave no respite</p><p>to the muscles which had been greatly taxed </p><p>after a night of wakefulness. </p><p> Finally, a little after noon, he came to</p><p>the lake shore, where the trail ran close to </p><p>the water’s edge, and at the base of the dills </p><p>which rose a perpendicular twenty feet here, </p><p>fifty feet there. And when he had drunk of </p><p>the dear, cold water and had turned from </p><p>looking out across the mile of dimpling </p><p>crystal, mountain fringed, he made a dis- </p><p>covery, a discovery which came very close </p><p>to costing him his life. </p><p>90 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Rising straight up through the clear air</p><p>above the cliffs at his side was a thin wisp </p><p>of smoke, such as climbs upward from a lit- </p><p>tle camp-fire. His heart beat quickly at </p><p>sight of it. It was back from the cliffs </p><p>maybe a quarter of a mile, he judged. </p><p>There must be a sort of table-land up there. </p><p>There he would find the man he had fol- </p><p>lowed. He saw that the tracks had come </p><p>to the lake here ahead of him; that they </p><p>continued northward along the shore. But </p><p>again he left them, again to make a short </p><p>cut, and began working his way up along </p><p>the cliff-side. Clinging with his fingers to </p><p>seams and crevices, driving the toes of his </p><p>boots into the cracks which they could find, </p><p>he drew painfully, slowly toward the top. </p><p> He was already so close to the edge above</p><p>that he could almost reach it with a hand </p><p>thrust up as far as he could reach, with fif- </p><p>teen feet between him and the ground be- </p><p>low. He was straining every muscle, his </p><p>face tight-pressed to the rocks, reaching up </p><p>for the rough hand-hold which just defied </p><p>him, when he was startled by a sound com-</p><p>ing clearly to him from below—the unmis- </p><p>takable sound of the dip of a paddle. </p><p> He saw the trap he had blundered into.</p><p>As he was, he could not turn, could not </p><p>draw a gun from his belt. There he was, </p><p>clinging to the face of the cliff, a mark to </p><p>be seen from across the lake, with no hope </p><p>of being overseen by the man who in a mo- </p><p>ment would drive a canoe around the rocky </p><p>point a few yards away, who could shoot </p><p>him in the back as easily as lift a finger. </p><p> Again he strained upward, and at last he</p><p>succeeded in grasping the rock which pro- </p><p>truded from the edge above, and drew him- </p><p>self up. Then he heard a cry from below, a </p><p>cry as of warning; the rock came away in </p><p>his hand, he clutched wildly to save him- </p><p>self, then plunged headlong, twisting as he </p><p>fell. As his body had struck he felt a swift- </p><p>driven pain through his head, and lost con- </p><p>sciousness in a black nothingness. </p><p> Luckily for him the fall had been broken</p><p>for he had twisted his body so that a part </p><p>of his solid weight struck upon his shoulder. </p><p>For life was still in him, and came back lit- </p><p>tle by little. He tried dizzily to lift his </p><p>head and could not. But he could turn a </p><p>little to the side so that he could see the </p><p>lake. There was the canoe, its paddle float- </p><p>ing in the water. And coming toward </p><p>^t was all so vague; he was so dizzy, the </p><p>blackness wavered so like a misty veil in </p><p>front of his eyes! For a little he would not </p><p>believe that his mind was clear yet, that he </p><p>was not wandering. For coming toward </p><p>him was a girl; a girl clad in rough, coarse </p><p>cloth, made into a short skirt and sleeve- </p><p>less blouse; a girl whose long braided hair </p><p>was scarcely a deeper, richer brown than </p><p>her bronzed cheeks, as brown as an Indian </p><p>maid, but with great, fearless gray eyes. </p><p>She came swiftly to his side and dropped </p><p>down upon her knees, flinging back the </p><p>thick braid which had brushed across his </p><p>breast. </p><p> “I tried to call, to tell you!” she was say-</p><p>ing, her low-toned voice coming to him </p><p>clearly through the singing in his ears. </p><p>‘‘Are you very badly hurt?” </p><p> He didn’t answer at once, but stared up</p><p>at the fresh, girlish beauty of her, frowning </p><p>to clear the mist from liis eyes, telling him- </p><p>self that it was impossible. </p><p> She leaned closer and put her quick light</p><p>hands upon his head. He felt a little shud- </p><p>der run through them. And then, before he </p><p>could speak, she sprang up, ran to the lake </p><p>and came back to him with water in h-.-r</p><p>two hands. She bathed the cut, washed the </p><p>blood away and, ripping a strin of cloth </p><p>from the hem of her skirt, tied it about his </p><p>head in a rude bandage. </p><p> “I thought—” he began, groping for</p><p>words. </p><p> “Yes, yes!” she broke in. “You could</p><p>not know how crumbling, how treacherous </p><p>to the climber those rocks are up there. I </p><p>tried to warn you. Are you very much </p><p>hurt?” </p><p> “No, I don’t think so,” he answered, still</p><p>frowning. And then, “You—where did you </p><p>come from?” </p><p> She laughed, sitting back from him—her</p><p>hands clasped about her two knees, her chin </p><p>tip-tilted, a glimpse of her round throat tell- </p><p>ing that the bronze and copper of her col- </p><p>oring were not racial, that the slender body </p><p>was of wonderful white and pink. </p><p> “No, you’re not badly hurt. Or you</p><p>wouldn’t be wondering about other folks! </p><p> With an effort of will he drew his eyes</p><p>away from her and turned them out across </p><p>the lake. He had come to find a man, the </p><p>man who had killed his partner; and in- </p><p>stead, this was what he had found. This </p><p>Naiad of a creature who was no shy back- </p><p>woods lass, tongue-tied and blushing, but </p><p>who looked at him with clear, amused eyes. </p><p>Beyond the Law </p><p>91 </p><p> Was Johnny Watson wrong about this</p><p>Devil’s Pocket, after all? He had said that </p><p>few men ever came into it; that they never </p><p>came back; that they never lived here. </p><p>Then how came this sparkling, radiant </p><p>woodland maid here? Where had she come </p><p>from now in her light canoe? Where was </p><p>she going? Were there others? </p><p> Slowly his eyes came back to her.</p><p> “I didn’t know any one lived here. I</p><p>thought-” </p><p> “Then what brought you here?” she</p><p>asked. </p><p> “I came looking for—some one.”</p><p> And then, realizing that this statement</p><p>contradicted the one he had just made, he </p><p>said by way of explanation: </p><p> “I meant that I did not know that wom-</p><p>enfolk ever penetrated so far into the wil- </p><p>derness. Miners, I know, lone prospectors, </p><p>get into all corners of the earth.” </p><p> “And womenfolk?” she challenged him.</p><p>“Are there then any places where men have </p><p>led that their womenfolk have not followed </p><p>them?” </p><p> He again tried to sit up, but sudden black-</p><p>ness swept upon him and he fell back. The </p><p>gleam of amusement went as swiftly from </p><p>her eyes, which were once more deeply wom- </p><p>anly, intensely feminine and soft. Her cool </p><p>hand was upon his forehead, pushing back </p><p>the tangled hair, smoothing it; and her </p><p>voice, cooing, tender, came to him like a </p><p>whisper out of a dream: </p><p> “You are hurt, badly hurt! Don’t try to</p><p>move. Just rest; be very still.” </p><p> Once more she sprang up and ran to the</p><p>lake shore to bring water in his hat. She </p><p>wet his forehead, readjusted the bandage </p><p>and let a little trickle of water run upon his </p><p>wrists. In a moment he opened his eyes to </p><p>look up at her, forcing a smile to meet her </p><p>anxious gaze. </p><p> “Can you tell me,” she said softly, “where</p><p>you are hurt? You can’t move?”' </p><p> 111 try again in a minute. It’s my whole</p><p>side, the right side.” He glanced down to- </p><p>ward his hand. “I think the wrist is broken. </p><p>I got it caught under me as I fell. I can’t </p><p>move it.” </p><p> “It is swollen already,” she told him after</p><p>a brief inspection. “Poor fellow, how it </p><p>must hurt!” </p><p> Then as professionally as a trained nurse</p><p>might have done it she moved her hand </p><p>down along his side. </p><p> “Where does it hurt most?” she queried,</p><p>her eyes upon his. “The shoulder, isn’t it?” </p><p> “Yes. Just a bad bruise, I think.”</p><p> “I hope so. Now, do you think that after</p><p>a while, when you have rested a little, you </p><p>can manage to walk? Just a few feet?" </p><p>“Yes. But where’Ll I walk to?” </p><p> “Just to the boat. And 1 11 take you the</p><p>rest of the way.” </p><p> “And the rest of the way?” he asked curi-</p><p>ously. </p><p> “You are a mighty inquisitive creature</p><p>for a patient!” she smiled. “Where do you </p><p>suppose? Home, of course!" </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>THE GIRL FROM THE LAKE </p><p>DICK rested for a long time. Then lean- </p><p>ing upon the girl’s firm shoulder, he </p><p>got to his feet and moved slowly with her </p><p>to the boat. When he had sunk in a hud- </p><p>dled heap in the narrow craft, his pulses </p><p>beating wildly, his head whirling, he began </p><p>to realize he had a great deal besides a scalp </p><p>wound and a broken wrist to reckon with. </p><p> With a swift flash of a glance at his white</p><p>lips and the little drops upon his forehead, </p><p>the girl stepped into the boat, took up the </p><p>paddle and pushed out into the lake. And</p><p>under her strong hands the canoe shot </p><p>through the water, headed for the north </p><p>end of the lake and for a little cove, cliU- </p><p>bound. </p><p> Dick half slept as the canoe sped on and</p><p>on. Finally he roused as they rounded a </p><p>rocky point, flashed by a Little green cove </p><p>into which a narrow spray of water fell </p><p>from the clifFs above, skirted a dense pine </p><p>grove, and turned suddenly into a second </p><p>tiny bay, sandy-beached. The canoe, its </p><p>slender nose thrust into the pebbles and </p><p>white sand, held there, swaying gently. Be- </p><p>fore Farley could move, the girl was out, </p><p>standing in the shallow water, her left hand </p><p>steadying the boat while her right reached </p><p>out to help him. </p><p> “If you feel strong enough, it's only a lit-</p><p>tle way, and you will rest better.” </p><p> Ashamed of his weakness in the face of</p><p>her confident young strength, he got to his </p><p>feet. Already it was a harder thing for him </p><p>to stand than it had been ten minutes ago. </p><p>His right shoulder, side and arm were utter- </p><p>ly useless. His leg. when he put a little of </p><p>his weight upon it, pained him so that with </p><p>his lip caught sharply between his teeth it </p><p>9- </p><p>Adventure </p><p>cost him much to keep back a cry of agony. </p><p> But in the end, leaning upon her, her arm</p><p>tight about him, he got into the water and </p><p>to the strip of sand. Looking anxiously for </p><p>some sort of camp, he saw ahead only a </p><p>thick grove of pine and fir like the one they </p><p>had passed, and the sheer clilTs beyond. </p><p> “I think,” she was saying to him, “that</p><p>if you rest again you will only be the stiffer, </p><p>sorer for it. Can you manage to walk a lit- </p><p>tle further?” </p><p> He nodded. And now he staggered on</p><p>with his guide and into the trees. And when </p><p>at last she stopped he again looked up, ex- </p><p>pecting to see the camp. Instead, he saw </p><p>that they had brought up at the edge of </p><p>the level strip with the cliff-wall in front of </p><p>them. </p><p> “We’re going up there,” she answered the</p><p>puzzled look in his eyes. “It isn’t as hard </p><p>as it looks. Can you go a little further?” </p><p> He nodded again painfully. So again</p><p>they moved on, ten feet along the cliffs, and </p><p>came, unexpectedly for him, upon a great, </p><p>gently slanting cut in the rocks, into which </p><p>bits of stone had been flung so as to make </p><p>rude, rough steps. It was harder now, slow- </p><p>er; for he had to lift, his left foot each time, </p><p>while she helped relieve the weight upon</p><p>the other, and wearily pull himself up. Ten </p><p>minutes dragged by before they had climbed </p><p>the twenty feet. </p><p> Upon the top was a plateau perhaps a</p><p>mile long, broken with trees and boulders, </p><p>five hundred yards wide. The fringe of </p><p>trees and ragged cliffs upon the side toward </p><p>the lake hid the table-land completely from </p><p>that direction. And, set between two gnarl- </p><p>ed cedars, at the very edge of a dense bit c&gt;f </p><p>the forest ,where it ran out from the sea of </p><p>verdure like a cape, was a low, rambling log </p><p>cabin, a thin spiral of smoke winding up </p><p>from its stone chimney. Here was “home.” </p><p> The cabin had all the signs of age, dis-</p><p>colored by many Winters, a vine a dozen </p><p>years old climbing over it. And Johnny </p><p>Watson, who had known the Devil’s Pocket </p><p>for a quarter of a century, had said that no </p><p>man ever lived here! </p><p> But Dick Farley was in little mood for</p><p>specu lation. He stumbled on, conscious on ly </p><p>of the dizzy nausea which drove even the </p><p>pain of his hurt side into a dim, faraway </p><p>background. After an endless groping </p><p>through a thickening fog he knew that they </p><p>had stepped from the sunlight into the </p><p>shade; felt rough boards under his boots; </p><p>felt that two arms, not ju*&gt;t one, were tight </p><p>around his body; knew wiih a grateful, long- </p><p>drawn sobbing breath that he was lying </p><p>upon blankets. </p><p> It was dusk in the cabin—twilight fra-</p><p>grant with the spicy odors dropping down </p><p>from the grove—when he found himself at </p><p>first groping for reality in a confused chaos </p><p>of emotions and then gradually coming to </p><p>full understanding. It was a great, low- </p><p>walled room, a rectangle of light marking </p><p>the door, two squares showing him the win- </p><p>dows and a deep-mouthed fireplace crack- </p><p>ling with a newly lighted fire. </p><p> Across the room from his bunk were a</p><p>heavy little table and rough chair. His </p><p>eyes went slowly to the floor—over the </p><p>squared saplings which went to make it, </p><p>across a bearskin, and to another door, </p><p>smaller, lower than the other, leading into </p><p>another room. He tried to lift himself up&gt;on </p><p>his elbow, and fell back stabbed by ihe </p><p>sharp pain in his shoulder. And then he </p><p>turned his head quickly toward the narrow </p><p>door. Then he had heard a step. </p><p> She came swiftly to him, looking down</p><p>at him with her great eyes filled witli con- </p><p>cern. When she saw the look in his she </p><p>smiled, and sitting down upon the edge of </p><p>his bed put her hand upon his forehead.</p><p> “You are better,” her rich voice was say-</p><p>ing in a matter-of-fact way. “You’re not </p><p>so feverish, and you know where you are, </p><p>don’t you?” </p><p> “Yes. Much better.” He called up a</p><p>twisted smile to meet hers. And then, “I </p><p>have been an awful nuisance.” </p><p> “You mustn’t say such things-”</p><p> But he insisted, looking steadily at her.</p><p>“If you hadn’t happened along—if you </p><p>hadn’t found me then, or soon—do you </p><p>know what would have happened to me? </p><p>If I hadn’t died from my fall and exposure, </p><p>I’d have died pretty soon from starvation. </p><p>Do you know that?” </p><p> “I know,” she retorted with great mock</p><p>severity, “that this is my case; you're my </p><p>patient, and I’m the doctor and the nurse. </p><p>And that you’re talking, whUe I believe the </p><p>proper thing for people who are sick is to </p><p>lie still. Also, you’re not going to die of </p><p>starvation now. When I heard you stir, I </p><p>was just making some soup for you. For </p><p>I’m the cook, too!” </p><p> When she had come back with a smoking</p><p>bowl of broth, she set the thing down upon </p><p>the floor for a moment while she insisted on </p><p>Beyond the Law </p><p>93 </p><p>propping him up with pillows. She shook </p><p>her head at him when he opened his lips to </p><p>protest, and thrust a spoonful of the soup </p><p>between them by way of further silencing </p><p>him. </p><p> “Good?" she demanded, when she had</p><p>set the empty bowl down on the floor. </p><p>“And now, do you know I am afraid that I </p><p>have about reached the end of my medical </p><p>knowledge! I’ve forbidden you to talk, and </p><p>I've fed you some broth. What next?" </p><p> “There’ll be nothing next. I’m going to</p><p>be all right soon." </p><p> “Of course you are! But we must do</p><p>something for your poor, hurt side. I have </p><p>some liniment-” </p><p> “Just the thing," he assured her. “I’ll</p><p>give myself a good rubbing-" </p><p> “You are very stupid,” she frowned at</p><p>him. “You will do nothing of the sort. I </p><p>haven’t dismissed my case yet, have I, Mr. </p><p>Man?” </p><p> “You’re discharged, Miss Girl!” he grin-</p><p>ned up at her. “And my other name is Far- </p><p>ley—Dick Farley.” </p><p> I won't be discharged that way, and my</p><p>name is Virginia Dalton, and you lie right </p><p>still, Dick Farley!” she laughed at him. </p><p> And when she came back she made him</p><p>lie upon his left side while she slit his shirt </p><p>from the shoulder down and bathed the </p><p>bruised muscles with the stinging oil. The </p><p>wrist, swollen and ugly, she bandaged with </p><p>soft white cloth. When she had finished </p><p>she sat back, flushed but triumphant, and </p><p>nodded at him approvingly. </p><p> \\ ith the fire roaring in the deep fireplace,</p><p> for chariness rather than from the need of</p><p> warmth, with a couple of misshapen, home-</p><p> made candles upon the mantelpiece, her</p><p> chair drawn up facing the bunk upon which</p><p> her guest and patient lay—at her request</p><p> lie was smoking his pipe and enjoving it—</p><p> \ irgima Dalton at last satisfied the man's</p><p> curiosity as well as she could</p><p> She and her father lived here together</p><p> had lived here for hrteen years. He had</p><p> wrought her, a baby of four, into this wil-</p><p> dness with him, had built the cabin, had</p><p> made this home. Of the world outside she</p><p> knew htHe more than she had known when</p><p> her lather brought her here—perhaps |esS-</p><p> as even the child's images of men Sd JS</p><p> en and cities, and the things thereof, had</p><p> been lost in the years. The father had</p><p> taught her had brought with them a few</p><p> books, had been always very dear to her</p><p>She did not know why he lived here, away </p><p>from his kind. He had once, long ago, told </p><p>her that his health demanded it. Of late </p><p>they had not mentioned the matter. </p><p> “But,” she ended, with a flush of eager-</p><p>ness lighting her face, “it’s nearly over! </p><p>We’re going to leave soon; go back to the </p><p>world where people are. Dear old Daddy </p><p>came in just this afternoon, a little while </p><p>before I went down to the lake, and I could </p><p>see right away that something had happen- </p><p>ed. He didn’t say what it was—he doesn't </p><p>say much at any time; but he told me that </p><p>he was going out again and might be gone </p><p>all night; but that when he came back I </p><p>could get ready to go! Isn't it glorious?" </p><p> But Dick, to whom there had come a sud-</p><p>den fear, made no answer, frowning as he </p><p>lay back staring up at the rough rafters. </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>VIRGINIA GETS A LETTER </p><p>npHE night dragged by, bringing little </p><p>sleep to Dick Farley, and Virginia </p><p>Dalton’s father did not return. It was the </p><p>longest night Dick had ever known. Hour </p><p>after hour he sat propped up against the </p><p>wall, the pillows behind him. and smoked, </p><p>staring out through the open door at the </p><p>shadows the moon made. They were deep </p><p>black shadows, and his spirit was caught in</p><p>them, strangely troubled. But at last, when </p><p>the tardy day was breaking, the spark in </p><p>his pipe-bowl died and he slipped down in </p><p>his pillows and slept. </p><p> When he awoke, the sun was flinging its</p><p>light through the tree-tops into the cabin. </p><p>Nature's was a soft mood this morning— </p><p>smiling, fragrant, audible with many low, </p><p>harmonious woodland notes. And through </p><p>the weave of still music, rising suddenly, </p><p>clearly, sweetly, a .girl’s voice floated in to </p><p>him in an old song. He watched the open </p><p>door expectantly. </p><p> In a little while she came in, her voice</p><p>hushed, walking tiptoe not to wake him, a </p><p>rod in one hand, a string of lake-trou t swing- </p><p>ing from the other. Her smile was as glori- </p><p>ously a radiant tiling as the morning itself </p><p>when her eyes met his expectant ones. </p><p> “Good morning!” she greeted him, com-</p><p>ing to his bedside. “Awake at last, are you? </p><p>I was afraid I should have to breakfast </p><p>alone.” </p><p>“Good morning," he answered, his eyes </p><p>Adventure </p><p>filled with the rosy beauty of her glorious </p><p>youth. “You have been fishing already!” </p><p>“I have been down to the lake—for my </p><p>morning plunge primarily, to tell the truth. </p><p>And in the second place for something for </p><p>my sick man to eat. Hungry?" </p><p> As she went to set the rod in its place in</p><p>the corner he looked after her approvingly. </p><p>Her hair hung aS" yesterday in two long </p><p>braids, one flung over her shoulder. Her </p><p>brown arms were bare from the shoulder. </p><p> “Yes,” he answered her, “I think 1 am</p><p>hungry. While you are starting breakfast I </p><p>think I’ll get up-” </p><p> “You'll do nothing of the kind,” she re-</p><p>torted positively. “I’ll put a table close to </p><p>your bunk, and we’ll eat here. After break- </p><p>fast, when the sun is a little higher and it’s </p><p>good and warm, maybe I’ll let you try to </p><p>get up.” </p><p>As she moved toward the kitchen with </p><p>her string of fi^h, he called after her: </p><p>“Your father? He hasn’t come in yet?” </p><p>“No. But we’ll look for him before long. </p><p>Dear old Daddy has dreadfully irregular </p><p>habits!” </p><p> Then he heard her clattering with pots</p><p>and pans, heard her singing broken snatches </p><p>of songs; and soon the $roma of coffee and </p><p>the sizzling of the trout told him that </p><p>breakfast was ready. She came in then, </p><p>removed the objects from the table across </p><p>the room—he saw with a little surprise that</p><p>they were several books carelessly scattered </p><p>—pushed the table to his side, dragged her </p><p>own chair up to it, and brought in the fish </p><p>and coffee and biscuits with tin cups, tin </p><p>plates, heavy iron knives, forks and spoons. </p><p> “There is no sugar, no butter, no cream,”</p><p>she laughed at him. “But you won’t mind, </p><p>will you?” </p><p> While they ate she told him more of her-</p><p>self; how she fished, or used the rifle to bring </p><p>down a squirrel from a pine, or to get a </p><p>deer, sometimes; how from her lookout, a </p><p>peak a mile behind the cabin, she mused </p><p>over the pale, shifting shades of daybreak </p><p>or the vivid splashes of color in the west </p><p>before the dusk came; how she let her eyes </p><p>go far out to the furthermost rim of the </p><p>vague, distant mountains and dreamed of </p><p>the other side—the land of men and women, </p><p>of cities where the cafions were streets, and </p><p>the peaks many-storied buildings. She </p><p>was not lonely because no one had taught </p><p>her the word, because she had known no </p><p>existence but this. She did not know un- </p><p>rest, because she had not lived in cities. </p><p> “But sometimes,” with a sudden wistful-</p><p>ness, “there is something here which talks; </p><p>and I can’t quite understand it!” She </p><p>pressed her two hands tightly upon her </p><p>breast. “When I have everything here, how </p><p>can there be anything lacking? When the </p><p>world is so big, how can it seem so little? </p><p>When the day is so filled with good things, </p><p>how can it seem so empty? When I am so </p><p>happy, how can I be, all of a sudden, so </p><p>sad? When I am laughing, why do I want to </p><p>cry-?” </p><p> He told her, too, of his own life; of the</p><p>schools he had gone to; of his work in cities </p><p>of the East; of the command to go West for </p><p>his health as her father had done; of the </p><p>fever of gold. But he said no word of his </p><p>partner—he could not speak of that, yet. </p><p>Nor did he mention the Cup of Gold, saying </p><p>merely that he had pushed into these moun- </p><p>tains, into her valley, prospecting. </p><p> “But you said,” she reminded him</p><p>frankly, “that you were looking for some </p><p>one?” </p><p> “Yes,” he admitted, turning from her</p><p>clear eyes to the door. “I will tell you </p><p>about that some other time.” </p><p>HE QUESTIONED her about her </p><p>father; and she, glad to find other </p><p>ears than the inattentive ones of her </p><p>woodland friends, spoke unreservedly. </p><p> He was a wonderful man, this James Dal-</p><p>ton, this “dear old Daddy.” A wonderful</p><p>man to look at: big, mighty of his hands, </p><p>handsome, a full-bearded giant. With a </p><p>great tender heart, too, forgetful at all times </p><p>of self, striving only for his daughter’s good </p><p>and happiness, doing all of the thousand </p><p>and one little things to please her, to make </p><p>life run smoothly and brightly for her. </p><p> He had filled the long hours with instruc-</p><p>tion, had taught her to read and write, had </p><p>read to her from the few books which had </p><p>come with them into their exile. He had </p><p>drawn pictures of busy cities with their </p><p>factories and hotels, their churches and </p><p>stores, and he had promised her that one </p><p>day he would take her with him to see </p><p>these marvelous things with her own eyes. </p><p> “And now,” she ended, her eyes luminous</p><p>with the dreamings of a golden fairyland </p><p>whose gates were to be thrown open to her, </p><p>“now we are going to see it all, very soon.” </p><p> She fell suddenly silent, looking beyond</p><p>the far horizon where her fancies led her. </p><p>Beyond the Law </p><p>95 </p><p> “It is worth being raised like this,” Far-</p><p>ley was thinking, “just to be able to walk </p><p>out into the other life—the life filled with </p><p>the things man has done. To wander </p><p>through it a little—and then to come back, </p><p>to stay." </p><p> When all of the chill of the mountain</p><p>morning had gone, drunk up by the warm, </p><p>thirsty sun, she allowed her sick man to </p><p>get up. Farley found that his wrist was </p><p>more swollen, more painful than it had </p><p>been last night, but began to hope that </p><p>there were no bones broken in it, that he </p><p>had sprained it badly and that in a few </p><p>days it would mend itself. His right side </p><p>was very nearly useless to him, the shoulder, </p><p>lower ribs and leg being sore and stiff; but </p><p>with a cane which she cut for him from a </p><p>sapling in the grove he was able to hobble </p><p>around slowly. </p><p> He realized, as he worked his way un-</p><p>steadily to the door, that it would be many </p><p>days before he could take up the trail which </p><p>he had vowed over his dead partner’s body </p><p>to follow until he found its end. </p><p> The morning passed, and they had lunch</p><p>together out under the trees at the edge of </p><p>the grove. Still Dalton had not come in. </p><p>But the girl seemed in no way surprised, </p><p>saying lightly that her father often was gone </p><p>a day or so without warning, that perhaps </p><p>he had found and was following the tracks </p><p>of a bear. </p><p> “I am going for my mail," she told him,</p><p>laughing at his wonder. “Do you feel </p><p>strong enough to come with me?" </p><p> “Mail?” he demanded incredulously.</p><p> "Yes! There may be a letter from</p><p>Daddy. The post-office is over yonder, </p><p>across the lake. If you think that you can </p><p>walk down to the canoe, we can paddle </p><p>over." </p><p> With the help of his cane, with the aid of</p><p>her hand when they came to the rude steps </p><p>in the clilT side, he finallv reached the edge </p><p>of the lake where they had left the canoe </p><p>yesterday. Leaving him here for a little, </p><p>she disappeared into the trees and came </p><p>back presently, carrying the light boat upon </p><p>her shoulders. </p><p> Helping him to get into it, she pushed out</p><p>from the shore, jumped in and paddled out </p><p>into the water, heading straight for the </p><p>western side a half-mile away. Upon a lit- </p><p>tle beach there, sandy and strewn with white </p><p>pebbles she grounded the canoe; and with a </p><p>word to him to wait while she asked for her </p><p>letter, hurried to a big rock, flat-topped? </p><p>set back a little from the water’s edge. </p><p> Turning so that he could see what she did,</p><p>she tossed toward him live pebbles which </p><p>she had picked up from the rock. And then </p><p>she came back to him. </p><p> “No letter?” he asked.</p><p> “Didn’t you see it?” she laughed into his</p><p>puzzled face. “Of course there was! Daddy </p><p>has gone over yonder,” pointing to the ridge </p><p>of hills sweeping upward into the westward </p><p>mountains. “How do I know? Those peb- </p><p>bles were in a row, pointing east and west, </p><p>with the biggest one at this end, the littlest, </p><p>our ‘pointer,’ at the west end And since </p><p>there were five pebbles, he means to be </p><p>gone about five days. No, he didn't add a </p><p>postscript saying what he was going for. </p><p>We need sugar, and we need ammunition. </p><p>Also—” with a little glance, purely femi- </p><p>nine, at her skirt—“I shall want a new </p><p>dress!” </p><p> “But,” suggested Farley, ‘‘there is no</p><p>town, no camp near enough for him to get </p><p>those things and be back in five days?” </p><p> “He is generally gone longer." she ad-</p><p>mitted as she got back into the canoe and </p><p>pushed off. “But it doesn’t matter what </p><p>he went for, does it? You'll have to put up </p><p>with my sole company for the five days.' </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>AFTER FIVE DAYS </p><p>nPHE days passed swiftly and pleasantly </p><p>for them—too pleasantly, Dick Farley </p><p>told himself with something of bitterness.</p><p>For what right had he to live from day to </p><p>day in this quiet haven, lured out of him- </p><p>self, out of his black lonesomeness for his </p><p>partner with that partner not a week dead? </p><p> It was true that his bruised side must</p><p>have kept him in a forced inactivity, that </p><p>he must have waited even as he was waiting. </p><p>But he should have spent day and night </p><p>with his thoughts oi “squaring things fur </p><p>poor old Johnny,” not in wandering through </p><p>the woods with a girl. </p><p> He told himself, as he lay unsleeping in</p><p>the quiet night, that he should go; that he </p><p>should go now that he could drag himself </p><p>away from her; that he had no right to stay </p><p>longer. Yet, where should he go? To pick </p><p>up the trail which he had followed to the </p><p>margin of the lake, and to follow it—where? </p><p> Would it bring him, after miles of winding,</p><p>96 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>back to the cabin perched upon the table- </p><p>land? Would he iind at the end of that </p><p>trail James Dalton, her father? Where was </p><p>Dalton now? Why had he gone away so </p><p>suddenly? Why had he said to her the </p><p>other day, the day before Johnny was </p><p>killed, that at last they could go back into </p><p>the world which so long ago he had left be- </p><p>hind him? Had he killed Johnny Watson? </p><p>If not he, who then? </p><p> If Dalton had killed Watson, then Farley</p><p>must kill Dalton. There was no other way; </p><p>there could be no other way. He must kill </p><p>the father of the girl who had brought him </p><p>here and cared for him, who had saved him </p><p>from dying alone and miserable—must kill </p><p>her “dear old Daddy,” whom she loved so </p><p>much, who had always been so good to her, </p><p>who was all that she had in the world. </p><p> And to stay here made matters worse.</p><p>To linger on in the home of the man whom, </p><p>perhaps, he was to kill; to listen to the in- </p><p>genuous, happy voice of the daughter; to </p><p>grow to see how wonderful a thing Nature </p><p>had built of this child of the wildwood; to </p><p>feel that day by day they were being drawn </p><p>closer together, that they were crossing a </p><p>frontier which in a little they could not re- </p><p>trace- </p><p> "If her father is the man who did it, have</p><p>I the right to take her father from her?” </p><p>he muttered. And again, “Has the man </p><p>who killed Johnny Watson a right lo live?” </p><p> So those five days were short days, fleeing</p><p>so swiftly for man and maid, filled with sun- </p><p>shine and the girl’s soft laughter and the </p><p>vague promise of life. And the nights were</p><p>long nights for the man; crowded with ugly </p><p>images, torn with doubts, beset with </p><p>threats of the future, thronged with ques- </p><p>tions to which he could find no answer. </p><p>Now there was nothing to do but to </p><p>wait. </p><p> But there was no waiting, no staying,</p><p>into the path into which their feet were </p><p>wandering, Dick Farley’s and Virginia Dal- </p><p>ton’s. It was the old, old story of a man </p><p>and a maid. And with the first gTeat throb </p><p>of understanding in the man’s heart (here </p><p>came, too, a contraction and a pain, and he </p><p>tore himself abruptly from the girl’s pres- </p><p>ence and went to stand frowning toward </p><p>the mountains into which Dalton had gone. </p><p>And her eyes, following him, were filled with </p><p>a tender light which was new to them, her </p><p>lips parted in a half-smile, her breast rising </p><p>and falling rapidly. For into her heart, </p><p>too, had come the throb, but not the pain of </p><p>the knowledge he had. </p><p> It was the sixth day. They had been t&lt;»-</p><p>gether so much; had talked of self and of </p><p>the other so frankly; had been so lost to the </p><p>world and drawn close to each other in the </p><p>solitude of the still mountains; had come to </p><p>find a new peace and contentment as they </p><p>were silent together watching the coming </p><p>of the dawn, the passing of the day, the slow </p><p>voyages of the moon through clouds and </p><p>stars; had been so all-sufficient each to each </p><p>that the short five days seemed like long, </p><p>bursting years when they looked back upon </p><p>them. It was only natural that the thing </p><p>which was happening with them should </p><p>happen. </p><p> Now, upon the morning of the sixth day,</p><p>the day which was to bring Dalton home, </p><p>their talk had died down suddenly. Farley </p><p>had fallen into an abrupt silence, his eyes </p><p>refusing to come back to hers. .And in a </p><p>little the girl’s mood followed his, and with </p><p>a faint trouble in her eyes she moved about </p><p>the cabin, as silent as he. The forenoon </p><p>passed; they lunched, with now and then a </p><p>fitful burst of conversation which ended </p><p>wretchedly, forced and unnatural, and the </p><p>afternoon wore on. It was nearly dusk </p><p>when James Dalton came home. </p><p> He was a very big man, tall, heavy, broad</p><p>of shoulder, and very dark; with sharp </p><p>black eyes under bushy brows, black hair </p><p>and beard shot with gray. He came upon </p><p>them from the lake, walking swiftly, his </p><p>rifle caught up under his arm. The girl was </p><p>sitting upon the doorstep, Farley upon a </p><p>rock a few feet away. Dalton’s eyes weDt</p><p>quickly from the young man to his daughter, </p><p>very keen, with a glint of surprise in them. </p><p> “Daddy!” the girl cried, running to meet</p><p>him, throwing her two arms about his neck. </p><p>“So you have finally got tired of roving and </p><p>have come back, have you?” </p><p> He ran an arm about her, and then,</p><p>with no reply to her bantering, demanded </p><p>quietly— </p><p> “Who is that?”</p><p> Farley was on his feet now, missing noth-</p><p>ing that the big man said, no gesture he </p><p>made. </p><p> “My name is Farley,” he returned for</p><p>himself. “A miner. I came into this coun- </p><p>try prospecting. Had a bad fall, and your </p><p>daughter took care of me.” </p><p> “Prospecting?” Dalton laughed unpleas-</p><p>antly. “Don’t you know, young man, that </p><p>Beyond the Law </p><p>97 </p><p>this country, every foot of it, has been gone </p><p>over and over during the last twenty years, </p><p>and nothing ever found? Prospecting!’’ </p><p>He strode by Farley towards the cabin, mut- </p><p>tering, “So they come right under our nose </p><p>and prospect!” </p><p>SAS HE went, Farley’s eager eyes saw </p><p>the hunting-knife which swung un- </p><p>scabbarded from his belt—a knife </p><p>more than usually broad-bladed; and his </p><p>heart sank. Little as he liked the looks of </p><p>this man, he had prayed that he prove to be </p><p>innocent of Johnny Watson’s blood. At the </p><p>door Dalton stopped and swung about, look- </p><p>ing steadily, deep into Farley’s eyes. </p><p> “When did you get here?” he asked</p><p>shortly. “How long have you been here?” </p><p> “I came five days ago—the day you</p><p>left.” </p><p> "Where did you come from?”</p><p> “From the coast. Then from Three</p><p>Sisters and the Yellow Queen country, </p><p>where I’ve been prospecting.” </p><p> “What brought you in here? Don’t you</p><p>know that this country has been combed </p><p>over a hundred times—that there is nothing </p><p>here?” </p><p> “I believed,” Farley retorted quietly,</p><p>“that there was gold in these mountains. </p><p>Since my fall I have not had a chance to get </p><p>about. So I haven’t learned yet that there </p><p>isn’t.” </p><p> Virginia Dalton had stepped a little from</p><p>her father’s side, and now stood with trou- </p><p>bled face looking from one man to the other. </p><p>There was an atmosphere of distrust, al- </p><p>most of open hostility, and she could not</p><p>understand. </p><p> Dalton turned slowly from Farley to the</p><p>girl. As he moved the iron rigidity left his </p><p>face, the cold glint passed from his eyes. </p><p>It was wonderful how the man’s whole ex- </p><p>pression softened. </p><p> “Come here, Virginia,” he said gently.</p><p>“I want to talk with you a little. Mr. Far- </p><p>ley,” with grave courtesy, “will pardon us?” </p><p> Farley bowed. Dalton, with his arm</p><p>about his daughter, entered the cabin, clo- </p><p>sing the door behind them, leaving the </p><p>younger man alone with his doubts, his sus- </p><p>picions, his fears. Their voices came to him, </p><p>confused, indistinct. He supposed that the </p><p>father was asking all about this intruder </p><p>in their quiet Eden; whence he had come, </p><p>what she knew of him and his purposes. </p><p> 1- mally the door opened and Dalton stood</p><p>7 </p><p>on the threshold looking steadily out at </p><p>Farley. </p><p> “I trust that you will overlook my rather</p><p>scant courtesy in greeting a guest, Mr. </p><p>Farley.” The tone was open, frank, pleas- </p><p>ant. “I am afraid that living a sort of exile </p><p>in the wilderness so many years has made </p><p>me forget the social usages. Will you come </p><p>in for a pipe? We can talk things over." </p><p> “I think,” Farley replied, his eyes running</p><p>past the broad form so nearly filling the </p><p>doorway to the form of the slender girl </p><p>standing within the room, “that I have al- </p><p>ready allowed myself to become a nuisance. </p><p> “Miss Dalton has been very kind to me.</p><p>But for her, I imagine, I should never have </p><p>come so easily out of my accident. Now I </p><p>am able to be about again, and I think that </p><p>I’ll take up the thing which brought me </p><p>here. I have some work to do. But—” </p><p>the two men’s eyes meeting again, each </p><p>studying the other—“I shall see you again </p><p>before I leave the valley for good. And’ — </p><p>with slow significance—“I shall tell you all </p><p>about what brought me here before I go </p><p>next time.” </p><p> He lifted his hat to the girl, said a brief</p><p>word of thanks and of good-by, and limped </p><p>away toward the lake. And his heart was </p><p>very bitter as he went, and there was little </p><p>hope in him. </p><p>CHAPTER VIE </p><p>FARLEY FOLLOWS THE TRATL </p><p>/”\UT of the few scanty details which </p><p>seemed to him to have any bearing </p><p>upon the thing he sought to know, Dick Far- </p><p>ley strove to piece together a chain of evi- </p><p>dence which his brain could accept as point-</p><p>ing to the guilt or to the innocence of </p><p>James Dalton. As he drew slowly away </p><p>from the cabin and toward the cliffs which </p><p>fell away to the lake, he arranged in mind </p><p>these things in a sort of logical order: </p><p> i.	There must have been some strong</p><p>motive for the killing of his partner. If </p><p>Dalton’s knife driven by Dalton’s powerful </p><p>hand had caused Johnny Watson’s death, </p><p>what motive could have moved Dalton to </p><p>the act? </p><p> This point he considered a long time. It</p><p>was possible that these two men had known </p><p>each other years before; that they had been </p><p>enemies; that revenge had steeled the mur- </p><p>derer’s arm. But it did not seem probable. </p><p>98 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>There was something a great deal mitre </p><p>likely. </p><p> Could it not be that Dalton, although he</p><p>denied the presence of gold in the valley, </p><p>had stumbled upon the same streak which </p><p>Johnny had found a month ago—the Cup </p><p>of Gold? That he had discovered Johnny's </p><p>tracks, had foreseen that he would return </p><p>with pack-horses, and had killed him rather </p><p>than that an outsider should come into his </p><p>valley and steal “his” gold? But why, </p><p>then, had he not killed Johnny’s partner as </p><p>well? </p><p> 2.	The crime had been committed with a</p><p>knife, unusually broad-bladed. Dalton </p><p>wore sue h a knife. </p><p> 3.	Something had made Dalton tell his</p><p>daughter upon the day of the murder that </p><p>they were going to leave the Devil’s Pocket </p><p>and go back into the world. What was it? </p><p>Did it have any bearing on the case? If not, </p><p>it was one of those odd coincidences which </p><p>occur sometimes, and Farley did not believe </p><p>very much in coincidences. </p><p> 4.	The man who had committed the crime</p><p>had stolen the two horses, and had hidden </p><p>them somewhere in the mountains to the </p><p>southwest of the valley. Dalton had gone </p><p>away into these same mountains and had </p><p>been gone five days. Why had he gone? </p><p>He had not had time to reach any of the </p><p>settlements; he had brought back no sugar, </p><p>no cloth. </p><p> 5.	Dalton had lived many years in a se-</p><p>clusion which was very like hiding. He </p><p>looked the part of a man who had never had </p><p>a sick day in his life. He was not here be- </p><p>cause the doctors had sent him. He was </p><p>a man of culture, a man who had traveled </p><p>and seen much of the world. He loved his</p><p>daughter. Why, then, had he suffered this </p><p>long exile? Why had he made her endure </p><p>it? </p><p> These matters rose above other consider-</p><p>ations in Farley’s mind. And in the end he </p><p>saw no way of arriving at any kind of cer- </p><p>tainty until he had gone back to pkk up </p><p>the old trail; until he had found the horses; </p><p>until he had seen if Dalton’s tracks led to </p><p>them and back from them to the cabin. </p><p> He stopped for a moment at the top of the</p><p>cliffs and turned to look back at the cabin. </p><p>He saw the girl standing there alone, her </p><p>eyes following him; saw her hand go up </p><p>swiftly as he turned to wave to her; re- </p><p>membered what she had done for him; saw </p><p>again the clean heart and budding woman’s </p><p>soul which she had not thought of hiding, </p><p>had not known huw to hide from him. Lift- </p><p>ing his hat to her, he hurried down the clifTs </p><p>and out of sight. </p><p> “It would kill her," he muttered. And</p><p>then, his eyes grown suddenly hard as he </p><p>tried to shut her out of his mind: “Never </p><p>mind, Johnny, old pardner. It’s all in the </p><p>cards, and we’ll play it out. If he did it, </p><p>he’ll pay for it!” </p><p> But when night came to him in the edge</p><p>of the mountains and he sat brooding over </p><p>his camp-fire he could not drive her out of </p><p>his wandering thoughts. He saw justice on </p><p>one hand, and loyalty to one's partner; and </p><p>on the other he saw the face of a girl who </p><p>was going to be happy, or broken upon her </p><p>lirst great sorrow—and it would be his act </p><p>to decide her life for her. He bowed his </p><p>head in his two hands, caught powerless in </p><p>the irony of fate. </p><p> For a week Dick Farley sought, almost</p><p>without rest to body and brain, tu work • ut </p><p>the puzzle which had been set before him. </p><p>He had gone almost back to where he had </p><p>buried Johnny Watson before he found the </p><p>trail of the two stolen horses. This he had </p><p>followed away from the valley through </p><p>narrow' canons, over rocky passes, for two </p><p>days. </p><p> As he had known from his partner’s</p><p>words, there was little water here. He </p><p>thought more than once that he we-uld be </p><p>driven back to replenish the bottle he had </p><p>carried with him. But the man who had </p><p>driven the horses here had known the coun- </p><p>try; and following the trail, turning with it </p><p>north or south of its general course, 1- arlev </p><p>found enough water in small springs and </p><p>slender streams to keep the life in him and </p><p>make his progress possible.</p><p> Fortunately the country was tilled with</p><p>small game, the quail, hare, grouse and </p><p>squirrels having more curiosity than fear, </p><p>coming close enough for him to kill with his </p><p>revolvers what he required for food. </p><p> He came at last upon the two horses in a</p><p>small, steep-walled valley set like a cup in </p><p>the mountains. Here there was much rich, </p><p>dry grass, and a narrow stream wandering </p><p>through it. With little trouble he found </p><p>the pack-saddle where it had been thrown </p><p>into a clump of manzanitas. Remembering </p><p>for the first time the map which Johnny </p><p>had told him was hidden in a saddle-blanket, </p><p>he found it readily. With a swift, cursory </p><p>glance at it he put it into his pocket. </p><p>Beyond the Law </p><p>99 </p><p> “To get the horses where they were left</p><p>in the main trail,” he muttered to himself, </p><p>“to bring them here, then to go back to the </p><p>lake would take a man just about five days </p><p>—the time that Dalton was gone.” </p><p> It was another point, a further link in the</p><p>chain; but, like the other links, it was not </p><p>strong enough to bear the burden of cer- </p><p>tainty. He must find other tracks—the </p><p>tracks the man had made when he left the </p><p>horses here. He must follow them. If they </p><p>led straight back over the hills to the lake, </p><p>he would know. And he had little doubt </p><p>that he would find them, and that they </p><p>would carry him once more to the Dalton </p><p>cabin. </p><p>AND now came the slowest, the </p><p>hardest of his work. To follow the </p><p>trail left by two horses was com- </p><p>paratively simple. To track a man over </p><p>these mountains, across hard ground and </p><p>dry gully, was another matter. </p><p> It was certain that the man Dalton, or</p><p>a possible other, had not gone back over the </p><p>same trail. It was devious, turning aside for </p><p>steep canons which a horse could not climb </p><p>but which a man could, full of many twists </p><p>and turns. A man on foot would take a </p><p>shorter way. And until he knew beyond a </p><p>doubt that that man had been Virginia Dal- </p><p>ton’s father, he could not tell whether to </p><p>look upon the eastern edge of the tiny val- </p><p>ley for it, upon the western, northern or </p><p>southern. But believing more and more </p><p>that the trail would lead toward the east, </p><p>he looked where he thought to find it. </p><p> And in an hour after finding the horses</p><p>he picked up the other trail—the tracks </p><p>made by the man who had brought them </p><p>here. He saw the deep print of a boot-heel</p><p>in the moist soil along the creek, found an- </p><p>other track a few feet farther on, then an- </p><p>other—all leading toward the east—toward </p><p>Devil s Pocket. </p><p> A glance at the encircling hills showed him</p><p>where the tracks must lead, where there was </p><p>a little nature-made pass, leading over their </p><p>cre.'.ts which a man might follow; and he </p><p>Pushed ahead in that direction, positive </p><p>that he would find the tracks there if there </p><p>were anv loose soil to keep them. He saw </p><p>readily that he must leave the horses where </p><p>they were for the present. </p><p>It took him another hour to climb up to </p><p>e gap in the hills. The darkness was corn- </p><p>mg on, but there was light enough for him </p><p>to see that the same heavy boots which had </p><p>left their imprint in the soft dirt by the </p><p>creek had passed here. He had done a long </p><p>day’s work; his side was paining him again, </p><p>the night was very near. So he built his </p><p>fire here and made his bed of fir-boughs. </p><p> In the first light of the dawn he break-</p><p>fasted and moved on once more toward </p><p>Devil’s Pocket. Everywhere underfoot was </p><p>a thick mat of pine-needles, upon which </p><p>a man’s foot would leave no sign. But the </p><p>natural pass in which he had camped led </p><p>straight on and into a canon upon the other </p><p>side of the little ridge; and where the soil </p><p>had sifted down from the canon sides to lie </p><p>here and there among the rocks strewing </p><p>the bottom of the ravine was the imprint </p><p>of the heavy boots again. Only infre- </p><p>quently stopping to assure himself that he </p><p>was not going wrong, he made what haste </p><p>he could back toward the lake. And he had </p><p>gone perhaps five miles before he came upon </p><p>a discovery which caused him to stop, </p><p>frowning, wondering. </p><p> He was in a small clearing, sandy-floored.</p><p>The tracks were here, still leading east. </p><p>But no longer was there the single trail. </p><p>Here, plainly outlined, were the prints left </p><p>by two men. They were side by side, alike </p><p>fresh, a very few days old. </p><p> Farley had just come down a long rocky</p><p>slope into the clearing, and did not know </p><p>where the second man's path had met the </p><p>first. There was little use in going back, in </p><p>trying to find out. He sat down, filled </p><p>his pipe and tried to make out the meaning </p><p>of this new complication. Who was this </p><p>second man? Where had he come from? </p><p>Where was he going? Had he been with </p><p>Dalton, or had he been trailing Dalton, or </p><p>had Dalton been following him? </p><p> In the end he could not see that the new</p><p>tracks made any great difference. If the </p><p>trail he was following led on to the lake, to </p><p>Dalton’s cabin, the thing was clear enough. </p><p> Down the long slope of the mountainside</p><p>from the clearing, into the rocky bed of the </p><p>ravine, the only logical way for a man to </p><p>follow, and out into a miniature valley be- </p><p>low, he continued without looking for the </p><p>tracks which he knew the hard, broken </p><p>ground would not show had he looked. </p><p> It was two miles before he again found</p><p>the boot-tracks in a bit of soft soil. And </p><p>here again had one man, only one man, </p><p>passed. The other, the second, had evi- </p><p>dently turned aside across the rock-strewn </p><p>IOO </p><p>Adventure </p><p>side of the mountain—had gone on his way, </p><p>prospecting. </p><p>CHAPTER IX </p><p>FARLEY PLNDS HIS MAN </p><p>TT WAS very quiet in Dalton’s cabin. </p><p> Were it not for the figures which the</p><p>flickering firelight found out uncertainly, </p><p>casting their grotesque wavering shadows </p><p>upon the floor and wall, one would have </p><p>said that there was no living thing there. </p><p> Dalton sat hunched forward in his chair</p><p>—his elbows on his knees, his big hands </p><p>knotted together, his eyes on the coals </p><p>scattered across the stone hearth. Near </p><p>the door, standing erect, his eyes upon the </p><p>still figure, his whole attitude that of a man </p><p>waiting, was Dick Farley. Now and then </p><p>he turned his head a little and looked sharp- </p><p>ly over his shoulder into the darkness out- </p><p>side, as if he feared interruption. </p><p> “So," said Dalton after a long silence,</p><p>no part of his body moving save his lips, </p><p>liis voice without expression. “So you’re </p><p>his pardner. 1 was afraid so, all along.” </p><p> “Yes.” Farley’s answer was as quietly</p><p>expressionless. “I was his pardner.0 </p><p> Dalton stirred in his chair. Farley’s</p><p>body lost none of its rigid motionlessness, </p><p>but his hand, the right one, dropped quickly </p><p>to his hip. Dalton had reached for his </p><p>pipe, filled it and lighted it with a coal </p><p>which he picked up in his fingers. Farley’s </p><p>hand remained upon the grip of his revolver. </p><p> “I'm sorry, mighty sorry,” Dalton went</p><p>on, without looking up. And then, “Is </p><p>there anything else you want to say?” </p><p> “I guess I've said about all. I camc</p><p>into this country with johnny—my pard- </p><p>ner. We were looking for gold. YVe were </p><p>interfering with no man. Johnny is dead, </p><p>murdered. It wasn't even a fair fight.</p><p>Who did it? I haven’t jumped at con- </p><p>clusions. I probably would if it hadn’t </p><p>been for—” he hesitated a fraction of a </p><p>second, during which for the first time </p><p>Dalton glanced up swiftly at him—“for </p><p>Miss Dalton. I wanted to be sure. I </p><p>tracked you from one end of the trail to the </p><p>other, to the cabin here. I think it’s pretty </p><p>clear. So I came here to accuse you of his </p><p>murder.” </p><p> It was the first time he had spoken so</p><p>clearly. But the two men had understood </p><p>each other without this putting a name lo </p><p>a deed. </p><p> •I don't like that word, Farley," ballon</p><p>cut in, his voice its expressionless as before, </p><p>his form as still. "You tall him Johnny? </p><p>Well, men’s names change often enough </p><p>out in this country for us not to quibble. </p><p>I suppose he’s carried a good man) names </p><p>since I saw him last." </p><p> “You knew him? A long time ago?"</p><p> “Yes. I hadn’t seen him for over fifteen</p><p>years, until-" </p><p> He didn’t finish. Instead, he said after</p><p>a moment: </p><p> “And being his pardner, you are going to</p><p>try to square things for him; to be judge and </p><p>jury and hangman; to kill the man who </p><p>killed him? Well, every man is his own </p><p>court out here, where we are so far beyond </p><p>the law. And when a man is dead it is up </p><p>to his pardner. Thai is the way you feel </p><p>about it? </p><p> “Yes,” Dalton laughed mirthlessly. "We</p><p>are beyond the law here—we are not bev ond </p><p>the reach of justice. Justice—or revenge? </p><p>It is hard to see one for the other, some- </p><p>times! You want to kill me, then?” </p><p>“There is no use talking that way, </p><p>Dalton,” Farley frowned. “You have lived </p><p>here too long; you know too well what is </p><p>the result of the thing which you have done </p><p>—you don’t deny it?” </p><p> “Will it make any difference what I;</p><p> “I don’t know'. I don't think so."</p><p> “You are going to try to kill me," Dalton</p><p>continued. “That won’t help your dead </p><p>friend much, but you’ll do it just the same. </p><p>I have no desire to be killed by you or bv </p><p>any other man. But soon there is going to </p><p>be another dead man here—you or I.J And </p><p>Virginia! I wonder what she is going to </p><p>do. That complicates mailers, but it </p><p>doesn’t in any great degree alter them, </p><p>does it? She’ll be back from the lake </p><p>pretty soon. We’d better get this over </p><p>with, unless you’ll listen to a proposition</p><p>I’m going lo make?" </p><p> “What is it?”</p><p> “That you let me tell you a story. Then</p><p>that you give over your though Is of re- </p><p>venge—or justice—for tonight; and that </p><p>tomorrow or the next day, ac soon as I can </p><p>get things in shape for the girl so that if I </p><p>am killed she will have a chance with trie </p><p>world, we go out into the woods somewhere </p><p>and—finish it.” </p><p> “it can wait," Farley replied, “until</p><p>tomorrow." </p><p> Dalton inclined his head gravely.</p><p>Beyond the Law </p><p>IOI </p><p> “Thank you. Now, if you will listen to</p><p>ray story. ’ Won’t you sit down?” Farley </p><p>dropped to the chair at his side. “I had </p><p>trouble in Richmond, where our home was. </p><p>I killed a man. Why, doesn’t matter to </p><p>you. Unfortunately for me, I killed that </p><p>man in the presence of another who saw the </p><p>thing done. That other man was your </p><p>pardner. He hated me as cordially as I </p><p>hated him. In any court in the world he </p><p>would have sworn that it was cold-blooded </p><p>murder, and his word would have hanged </p><p>me. </p><p> “He would have lied when he said it, but</p><p>he would have sworn it just the same. As </p><p>it was, I had to run for it. Virginia was a </p><p>little baby, six months old. Her mother—” </p><p>his voice growing very hard—“was not </p><p>strong. She died. I wasn’t with her. </p><p>I was being hounded from one place to the </p><p>other; and the man who hounded me when </p><p>the whole thing would have been dropped, </p><p>the man who was the real murderer of my </p><p>wife, was the man who made it necessary </p><p>for me to run before what men call justice. </p><p>I did go back and get the baby. Then w^e </p><p>came here. </p><p> “Again and again, as the years rolled</p><p>around, I got word from the world; each </p><p>time to hear that what the world had for- </p><p>gotten was not forgotten by the man who </p><p>was not satisfied in my exile, my loss of all </p><p>the things which counted. He was still </p><p>looking for me, he still would stop only </p><p>when he saw me given over into the hang- </p><p>man’s hands. A few days ago I found that </p><p>he had penetrated into this wilderness. </p><p>His prospector’s outfit did not mislead me. </p><p>He was looking for me. I was glad of it. </p><p>I told Virginia that soon we were going </p><p>back into the world from which we had </p><p>hidden so many long years. I killed </p><p>him.”</p><p> “You murdered him,” replied Farley cold-</p><p>y°U glven him a cilance-” </p><p> ‘How do you know I murdered him?</p><p>fhancer- y°" "°W 1 didn’t	a</p><p>„nZhtL,h°le i?,hi,s thro*t-death </p><p>upoa him suddenly, unexpected!}'.

For, some- </p><p>how—” he looked up with a strange smile </p><p>upon the tightened lips— “I imagine that </p><p>you are going to come out of this alive, and </p><p>I’m going to come out of it—dead! You'll </p><p>wait until tomorrow?” </p><p> “I'll wait.”</p><p> Farley got to his feet. Dalton rose with</p><p>him. </p><p> “You’ll sleep here tonight?”</p><p> “No. I’ll sleep outside—not far away,”</p><p>meaningly. </p><p> “Oh, I won’t run away,” laughed Dalton.</p><p>“Good night!” </p><p> Farley made no answer as he backed to</p><p>the door and stepped swiftly outside. He </p><p>closed the door behind him, and strode </p><p>rapidly away into the darkness. Of no </p><p>mind to sleep, he built a little fire of dead </p><p>twigs and pine-cones, and sitting upon a </p><p>fallen log stared into the flames moodily. </p><p>HE HAD sat there, motionless, for </p><p>five minutes when something im- </p><p>pelled him to look up. Standing </p><p>a few feet from him, just witiiout the circle </p><p>of his firelight, was Virginia Dalton. He </p><p>rose quickly, took a step forward and </p><p>stopped. He did not at once speak, wait- </p><p>ing for her. </p><p> “So you have come back?” she said gen-</p><p>tly. “I have missed you.” </p><p> “Yes, I have come back.”</p><p> “And you found what vou wanted to</p><p>find?” </p><p> “I found what I was looking for. I don’t</p><p>know that I wanted to find just that,” he </p><p>ended bitterly. </p><p> She came slowly toward him until she</p><p>stood in the firelight, so near that he could </p><p>have put out his hand and touched her. </p><p>He saw the brown arms reflecting the waver- </p><p>ing fire, the dark braids, the full, round </p><p>throat, her eyes even, deep and earnest. </p><p>And something he glimpsed in their quiet </p><p>depths sent a quick pain to his heart.</p><p> “Yes,” she answered as if he had spoken.</p><p>“I heard. I listened outside. I heard </p><p>every word.” She broke off, only her </p><p>hands clasping each other tightly showing </p><p>him that the calmness of her still figure </p><p>was forced over a tumult within. “And </p><p>so,” she barely whispered after a little, “you </p><p>have come back to kill dear old Daddy!” </p><p> He moved back, away from her, back</p><p>from the quiet misery in her eyes, making </p><p>no answer. And she came with him, step </p><p>102 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>by step until he had stopped, and put her </p><p>hand upon his arm. </p><p> “You have come back/’ she repeated in</p><p>the same lifeless tone, so different from the </p><p>glad note which he hud so often thrill </p><p>through her voice, “to kill Daddy. Is </p><p>that it?” </p><p> “You heard,” he muttered heavily.</p><p> “Yes. He killed your pardner.” She</p><p>shivered and the hand upon his arm grew </p><p>very tense. “So you want to kill him. Will </p><p>that do any good? It will make me very </p><p>miserable. It will take my father away </p><p>from me—all I have. And will it do your </p><p>pardner any good?” </p><p> “Why did you come?” he cried out</p><p>fiercely. “You don't understand.” </p><p> “Don't I understand?” She smiled at</p><p>him—a wistful, wan little smile which hurt </p><p>him more than if she had cried out aloud. </p><p>“I understand this much: tliat in all the </p><p>world 1 have but Daddy, and that he has </p><p>been always so good to me, and that you </p><p>want to take him away from me! </p><p> “I understand that you want to kill</p><p>him because he killed your pardner, and </p><p>that it won’t do any good for you to kill </p><p>him; it won’t bring your pardner back to </p><p>life, it won't make him rest any easier. I </p><p>understand that these things are not for </p><p>men to do, but for God. God sees better </p><p>than we can see, and clearer and deeper </p><p>down into our hearts. And He would not </p><p>do what you are going to do. He would </p><p>not take my Daddy away from me.” </p><p> When he made no answer, finding no</p><p>answer to make, she stood silent a little, </p><p>letting her head sink forward despairingly. </p><p>And then, again lifting her eyes to his, </p><p>her lips, her chin quivering as she strove </p><p>to make her faltering voice firm: </p><p> “Don’t you sec that you will make it</p><p>seem almost as if I had killed him, myself? </p><p>l?or if I had not brought you to the cabin </p><p>you would never have found it, maybe.</p><p>If I had not thought you were a friend and </p><p>brought you there, maybe you would not </p><p>have lived! Don't you see? </p><p> “Don't you sec?” Again, groaning aloud</p><p>he had drawn back from her, and she had </p><p>come to his side once more, had again lain </p><p>her hand softly upon his arm. “And don't </p><p>you see something else? We were growing </p><p>to be such friends, you and I, Dick Farley. </p><p>Didn’t I read right the things which you </p><p>did not say that day you went away, the </p><p>things which were in your heart? Didn’t </p><p>you see the things in my heart, too? Didn’t </p><p>you see?” </p><p> He fell her hand tremble pitifully, saw</p><p>the anguish written upon her young fate. </p><p> “We were going to be good friends—oh,</p><p>such good friends! And now"—with a dry </p><p>sob as she put her face in her two hands and </p><p>shook from head to foot with the storm in </p><p>her bosom—“and now you want to end it </p><p>all, and to kill him!” </p><p> For a blind moment he fought hard with</p><p>the thing which she had thought was friend- </p><p>ship. And then, seeing her swaying there, </p><p>seeing her mute misery, he put out his arms </p><p>and drew her close to him. </p><p> "Friends!” he cried, his voice harsh in</p><p>her ears, like the voice of a man in anger. </p><p>"Friends! Can’t you see that I love you— </p><p>love you as a man can not love his friends— </p><p>as he can love only the one woman in all </p><p>the world!” </p><p> She lifted her face quickly to his, md</p><p>through the tears glistening upon Iv.-r • heeks </p><p>he could see a new look, a look of gladness </p><p>and of hope. </p><p> “Oh!" she whispered, drawing closer in</p><p>the embrace of his arms. “I am glad: </p><p>And you won’t hurt him now; you cani.;” </p><p>For a little he held her to him. tightly </p><p>pressed, as if defying the world to t.i’-.e her </p><p>away from him. And then slowly his arrr.s </p><p>loosened and dropped to his side. For </p><p>again he had seen Johnny Watson’s face </p><p>staring up at him through the faint light of </p><p>the dawn; again he realised that because </p><p>she was Dalton’s daughter. Dalton was none </p><p>the less his partner's murderer. </p><p> “What is it?’’ she asked softly. “Isn't</p><p>it all right now?” </p><p> "It is all wrong, Virginia, dear,” he said</p><p>bitterly. “And this only makes it more </p><p>and more wrong. Don't ask me anything </p><p>more. Only go back to your father and let </p><p>me think things over. 1—” his voice </p><p>was hard and steady— “I don't know </p><p>what is going to happen. I don’t think</p><p>that I am going to kill him. W ill you kiss </p><p>me good night, dear?” </p><p> He watched her as she went slowly</p><p>through the night, watched her as for a </p><p>moment she stood in the dim rectangle of </p><p>light made by the open door, and then bad </p><p>only the darkness and the shooting flames </p><p>of his camp-fire about him. </p><p> “Johnny!” he muttered when at last</p><p>there was but a dead pile of ashes where </p><p>his fire had been. "If 1 don’t kill him if </p><p>Beyond the Law </p><p>103 </p><p>he kills me instead—it will be all right, </p><p>won’t it, Johnny?” </p><p>CHAPTER X </p><p>JUSTICE </p><p>THE day had come, and Dick Farley </p><p>was firm and calm in his determina- </p><p>tion. But the thing which the day was to </p><p>bring need not come yet. There was no </p><p>call for haste, while there was an urge deep </p><p>down in his soul to spend this day alone. </p><p>He turned his back upon the cabin and </p><p>went, walking rapidly, down to the quiet </p><p>shore of the lake. </p><p> Until now he had scarcely more than</p><p>glanced at Johnny Watson’s map. The </p><p>Cup of Gold had seemed the small thing </p><p>which gold is always when come the great, </p><p>vital issues of life. But now it was dif- </p><p>ferent; now he could see a reason in going </p><p>on over Johnny’s trail, in finding the hill- </p><p>side that was “rotten with gold.” This </p><p>was something which must be done before </p><p>he looked into Dalton’s eyes again—for the </p><p>last time. </p><p> A long, curving line along one side of the</p><p>brown cigarette paper was marked in pain- </p><p>fully small letters, “East Shore.” A dotted </p><p>line marked “Trail” ran along this. “High </p><p>Cliffs” indicated the spot where Farley had </p><p>attempted to climb up to the plateau, </p><p>where he had fallen. The doited line ran </p><p>on by this, close to the lake shore, and was </p><p>marked “2 mile.’’ Then there was a little </p><p>triangle with the words “Big White Rock.” </p><p>Here the dotted line swerved at right angles </p><p>—to the east—“200 paces.” Here was the </p><p>word, “Canon.” That was all upon one </p><p>side of the paper. Upon the other, written </p><p>lightly was: </p><p> Enter mouth canon. Go straight about</p><p>five hundred yards. Climb dead pine-tree </p><p>leaning against east bank. Straight up to </p><p>top of ridge. Follow ledge to clilT. Look </p><p>along bottom of cliff.” And that was all. </p><p> Farley put the paper again in his pocket</p><p>and turned north along the lake shore. </p><p>He had perhaps two miles and a half, may- </p><p>be three miles, to go, and be was growing </p><p>anxious to see this mine which his partner </p><p>had discovered. </p><p> It was a simple matter to follow the trail,</p><p>a natural path at the lake’s edge, kept open </p><p>by the deer and other woodland animals </p><p>that came down lo drink or browse upon </p><p>the long grass here. And before he had </p><p>covered more than half of the two miles he </p><p>saw the “big white rock” which Johnny </p><p>had marked for him, close to the water, </p><p>rising straight up from the level floor of the </p><p>valley. </p><p> Here, with a glance at his map to make</p><p>sure that he was right, he turned eastward, </p><p>counting his steps. He had stepped off one </p><p>hundred and twenty-five when he stopped, </p><p>frowning. For nowhere were the moun- </p><p>tains far from the lake, and already he had </p><p>entered a canon. And Johnny’s map had </p><p>said two hundred paces. </p><p> “Johnny wouldn’t make a mistake like</p><p>that,” he told himself. </p><p> And, again counting, he moved on and</p><p>into the canon until he had counted another </p><p>seventy-five paces. Then he understood. </p><p> Here, cut into the wall of this canon, was</p><p>a second, a narrower, steeper-walled ravine, </p><p>evidently the one Johnny had had in mind </p><p>when he said, “Enter mouth of canon/' </p><p>The general trend of this one was north and </p><p>south. He pushed on into it, estimating </p><p>roughly the five hundred yards. </p><p> And then, with a little quickening of the</p><p>pulses, he saw the dead pine-tree. It had </p><p>fallen, and now, with its roots half torn out </p><p>of the rocky soil, lay sprawled against the </p><p>eastern bank of the canon at an angle of </p><p>about forty-five degrees. The banks here </p><p>were so steep, rising fifty feet above him, </p><p>that a man would have had a hard time </p><p>climbing them. But the fallen tree was at </p><p>once a pointer to the Cup of Gold and a </p><p>ladder to reach it. </p><p> Up on the top of the bank he found the</p><p>ridge, and working his way slowly along </p><p>that he came to the long line of cliffs which </p><p>standing above made the side of the moun- </p><p>tain look like a giants stairway. And now, </p><p>liis heart beating with the exertion of the </p><p>struggle upward and with the eagerness of </p><p>quickened anticipation which comes to the </p><p>miner at a time like this, no matter what </p><p>face the day wears, he stopped and let his </p><p>eyes rove along the bottom of the cliff. </p><p> And in a moment he saw what he looked</p><p>for, and hurried forward. There were the </p><p>marks of a pick in the crumbling bank, and </p><p>there- </p><p> “Poor Johnny!” he muttered. “Poor</p><p>old Johnny! To feel his pick sink into this, </p><p>to have it in his hands—and never to really </p><p>work the greatest mine this country ever </p><p>saw!” </p><p>104 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> For here, showing so that a novice must</p><p>liave seen and known and understood the </p><p>glittering promise of it, was a great vein of </p><p>gold laid ban against the bottom of the </p><p>cliff-side, where last year’s snows had set </p><p>the rocks free above; where the side of the </p><p>cliff had fallen outward disclosing the thing </p><p>which the mountains hail hidden so well </p><p>and so long. </p><p> It was as rich as any pocket the miner</p><p>had ever seen—richer. And it was not a </p><p>pocket at all, but a wide, deep vein which </p><p>ran back into the mountainside; which </p><p>would make not one man. but hundreds of </p><p>men, rich, would give them riotous days </p><p>and wild nights, would bring to the realiza- </p><p>tion of dreams long dreamed. And Johnny </p><p>Watson, the man who had found this, who </p><p>had turned back with but a handful of the </p><p>precious stuff that he might bring his </p><p>partner with him, was dead and would </p><p>never take out a nugget. </p><p> "All in the cards, Johnny," he mused</p><p>bitterly. "And the cards are running </p><p>wrong for you and me." </p><p> He sat upon a boulder, his eyes brood-</p><p>ing over the yellow promise, his heart </p><p>heavy with the love for a lost partner and </p><p>the newer love for a woman who was to be </p><p>lost as soon as he had found her. The </p><p>shadows drew back from him, the sun found </p><p>him out; and still he sat staring at the thing </p><p>which promised and mocked. </p><p> At last, with the short laugh of a tired</p><p>man. he got to his feet, stood for a little </p><p>looking at the smooth cuts a pick had made </p><p>in the rocky bank, and then, with no further </p><p>spoken word, with no look behind him, </p><p>moved slowly away and went back along the </p><p>ridge, down the pine-tree and to the lake- </p><p>side. </p><p> There he sat down upon the big white</p><p>rock, and with the stub of a lead-pencil </p><p>wrote a letter upon the bit of oiled paper in </p><p>which his pipe tobacco was wrapped. </p><p> Virginia, dear, if I am never to see you again—</p><p>and who knows how a day like this is going lo end? </p><p>—this is to say good-by for mr, I think that you</p><p>knew how much I love you before I told you last </p><p>night- So t do not need to tell you again. I didn’t </p><p>think that love came this way, so swiftly. I am </p><p>glad, more glad than you can ever understand, lhat </p><p>it has come. You will go back lo the world. I </p><p>want you to be very happy. T am enclosing a </p><p>little present, a farewell gift. I want it to help </p><p>make you happy, dear. Good-by. </p><p>Dick Farley, </p><p> AND folding the paper, he put</p><p>^ . into it Johnny Watson’s map. </p><p>*-' Then he went back along the lake- </p><p>side and to the cliffs below the cabin, to </p><p>wait for James Dalton. </p><p> He thought that it must be about ten</p><p>o’clock when at last Dalton came, walking </p><p>swiftly from the cabin. Farlfej got tu his </p><p>feet and waited. Neither man spuke until </p><p>Dalton came within a dozen paces of him </p><p>and stopped. Then Farley said quietlv— </p><p> “Ready?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> The man's face showed no emotion, there</p><p>was none in his steady voice. </p><p> "Your revolver is of a smaller caliber</p><p>than mine,” Farley went on iu a slow, </p><p>matter-of-fact tone. “You can have one </p><p>of my forty-fives, if you want it." </p><p> Dalton looked at him curiously.</p><p> “Thanks. I don't want it." And then</p><p>after a short silence in which the t o men </p><p>eyed each other steadily: “There is no </p><p>other way?” </p><p> “No. There can be no other way. f</p><p>kill you or—you kill me.” </p><p> “Then.” Dalton answered, as if he had</p><p>expected this, “if I don’t come through it </p><p>you will find a couple of letters in my pock- </p><p>et. Give them to Virginia.” </p><p> "I have written a note, too,” Farley said</p><p>by way of reply. “It is for her." </p><p> With slow, steady lingers he drew a re-</p><p>volver from his holster. For the instant </p><p>he lost sight of the man in front of him as </p><p>his eyes went upward along the cliffs and </p><p>his thoughts ran ahead of them to the cabin </p><p>and the girl there. The world was un- </p><p>naturally silent, the pines about them like </p><p>carvings in jade, without a tremor, the </p><p>sunlight falling softly about them. The </p><p>moment was strangely lacking the thrill of </p><p>excited nerves he had anticipated. </p><p> That he and this man were . landing so</p><p>close together, that each held a revolver in </p><p>his hand, that death was very near, and </p><p>the world and life and love drawing very </p><p>far away, did not impress him as he would </p><p>have said that such a thing would impress</p><p>him. The whole thing was too big, meant </p><p>too much, for him lo grasp it. </p><p> “Virginia may come," Dalton's deep-</p><p>toned voice startled him. “We had better </p><p>—hurry.” </p><p> “Yes,” he answered. “We bad better</p><p>hurry.” </p><p> So they stood facing each other, a gun in</p><p>Beyond the Law </p><p>105 </p><p>cach right hand, the mu2zlcs downward. </p><p>There was not twenty feet between them. </p><p> “We shoot together?” Dalton was ask-</p><p>ing him. </p><p> “Yes. And the signal?”</p><p> “Count three. That will do as well as</p><p>any way. Will you count?” </p><p> Farley nodded. And his voice, quiet,</p><p>low, steady, with regular pauses between </p><p>the words, said: </p><p> “One—two—three!”</p><p> The two shots rang out together, like</p><p>one. And the two men, their faces gone </p><p>white and tense drawn, stood looking at </p><p>each other through the slowly lifting smoke. </p><p>For as he fired, Farley had thrown the </p><p>muzzle of his gun downward so that the </p><p>ball plowed through the sand at the feet of </p><p>Virginia Dalton’s father, and Dalton’s bul- </p><p>let had winged its way high overhead, </p><p>seeking the far shore of the lake. </p><p> “- you!” cried Farley shrilly, a red</p><p>flood of blood in his face as he understood. </p><p>“Why did you do that? Do you want to </p><p>be killed, man?” </p><p> The man who could have killed him had</p><p>spared him, the man who had murdered </p><p>Johnny Watson had stood up courting death </p><p>and had made no attempt to save himself. </p><p>And the knowledge only maddened the man </p><p>who had chosen to die himself at the hand </p><p>of the man he could not kill—no, not even </p><p>to “square tilings” for a dead partner. </p><p> “I have killed two men in fair fight in my</p><p>life,” Dalton told him sternly, his own face </p><p>flushed hotly. “I am not going to kill a </p><p>third. And I do not choose to be made to </p><p>look like a fool French dude in a polite </p><p>duel! Are you going to kill me?” </p><p> Farley laughed evilly.</p><p> “In fair fight!” he mocked. “To cut the</p><p>throat out of a man before he had seen you, </p><p>to sneak up on him in the dark—and'you </p><p>call that fair fight!” </p><p> “I gave him his chance! And he took</p><p>it—not being a fool!” </p><p> “A chance!” scoffed Farley, the rising</p><p>anger within him making him for the second</p><p>forget that this was her father, his gun </p><p>raised. “To drive your-knife through </p><p>a man’s throat—to come at him in the </p><p>dark-” </p><p> “I used no knife, and I came upon him</p><p>in broad day fight. And I shot the throat </p><p>out of him, after I got this!” </p><p> He threw back his shirt collar and showed</p><p>a raw wound at the base of his neck. And </p><p>Dick Farley, suddenly seeing the light of a </p><p>great hope, dropped his revolver into the </p><p>sand as he clutched Dalton's arm. </p><p> “Don’t lie to me,” he said in a harsh</p><p>whisper. For he had remembered those </p><p>other tracks he had found, and his whole </p><p>body was shaking with what it might mean </p><p>to him. “Where did you find him?” </p><p> Dalton looked at him curiously, as if</p><p>upon a madman. </p><p> “Over yonder.” His arm swung about</p><p>until his outstretched forefinger pointed </p><p>toward ‘the west—not the south. “Where </p><p>he had left two horses in a little hollow. I </p><p>followed him back-’’ </p><p>“Was he a little man, and stocky?" </p><p>Farley was crying hoarsely. “Blue-eyed. </p><p>a little blond mustache-?” </p><p> “He was a man six feet in his stockings.”</p><p>Dalton retorted, staring. “Black-haired </p><p>and blacker-hearted. If he was your </p><p>pardner-” </p><p> “He wasn’t my pardner. Don't you see,</p><p>man?” It came with sudden conviction, </p><p>with a great gasp of relieved nerves. </p><p>“You—you came upon the man who killed </p><p>Johnny! You killed Johnny Watson’s mur- </p><p>derer!” </p><p> And as Dalton stared after him, like a</p><p>man stunned, Dick Farlev was running </p><p>across the sandy beach and toward the </p><p>cliffs. For he had seen the slender figure </p><p>of a girl coming slowly through the trees, </p><p>and he had a wonderful message of life and </p><p>hope and love for her. </p><p>|/ YKthE oath </p><p> §|g	BY THE EAE&gt;TH</p><p>Gordon M£ Creagh </p><p> Author of "Featuring Morton St. Clair,” “The Brass Idol," etc.</p><p>“Oh, the East is East, and the West is West, and </p><p> never the twain shall meet.”</p><p>lIXTY-WAN — sebenty - three. </p><p>Renshawe Sahib to play,” sang </p><p>I out the Madrass marker with </p><p>soulless monotony, and pushed </p><p>the little ivory pointer along the score- </p><p>board with the end of the cue-rest. </p><p> It was one of the four-handed games so</p><p>popular in the Planters’ Club of Darjiling.</p><p>Renshawe’s partner whooped and praised </p><p>his maker aloud. </p><p> “Oh, Billy!” he yelled. “Look at your</p><p>position. Our enemy is delivered bound </p><p>into our hands. Here’s the beginning of a </p><p>twenty break, even for you.” </p><p> Renshawe tore himself with visible re-</p><p>luctance from his occupation of gazing ab- </p><p>stractedly out of the window across the in- </p><p>tervening ranges and valleys at the tremen- </p><p>dous snow-peaks of the Himalayas, and </p><p>building dream-castles. Born in the shadow </p><p>of the great range, where his earliest im- </p><p>pressions had been built around the won- </p><p>derful legends of the hill-people about that </p><p>mysterious unexplored region, the silent </p><p>beauty of the everlasting snow-caps had al- </p><p>ways drawn him with an indefinable desire </p><p>to go look-see. </p><p> He came forward and looked at the lay;</p><p>then he waved aside the proffered cue-rest </p><p>and bent over on his toes. He was not tall </p><p>—only live feet eight—and his great breadth </p><p>of shoulder made him look even shorter. </p><p> “Easy now, with a good follow, and re-</p><p>member you’re against the nap, cautioned </p><p>Crandall, the partner. </p><p>Renshawe bent his great shoulders over </p><p>his cue, grunted an uncompromising “Huh! </p><p>of acknowledgment, and carefully followed </p><p>his instructions. </p><p> Then Crandall took the name of the Lord</p><p>in vain with fluency and point. He further </p><p>improvised several variations while he </p><p>strode around the table and tore hi; hair. </p><p> Renshawe smiled cheerfully and said</p><p>nothing. What he thought nobodv could </p><p>tell. </p><p> Nobody ever could tell what Renshawe</p><p>thought. His face, which wore a habitual </p><p>smile of cheerful indifference to whatever </p><p>fate the world might hold in store for him, </p><p>was otherwise inscrutable, arid gave not the </p><p>least clue to what was going on behind the </p><p>mask. </p><p> What he did for a living was equally a</p><p>mystery; which, in India, where everybody </p><p>knows everybody else’s most intimate af- </p><p>fairs, was unprecedented. They knew, of </p><p>course, that he had been born in the coun- </p><p>try, and that he had later been sent home’’ </p><p>to some city which they generalized vaguely </p><p>as “America” to be educated; and that later </p><p>again, he had returned and wandered for </p><p>the last seven years all over the Far East. </p><p>But what he did, and how he earned Ids </p><p>money, of which he always seemed to have </p><p>a reasonable supply, nobody had ever been</p><p>able to discover. </p><p> And at this, several old duennas who</p><p>were exposing their wares in the shape of </p><p>daughters and nieces and other relatives, in </p><p>the recognized marriage market of the hill </p><p>sanatorium, were considerably piqued; for </p><p>in India the first requirement of the busi- </p><p>ness, on which all calculations are based, is, </p><p>“How much does he make?" And the next, </p><p>“Is it a pensionable job? " </p><p>The Oath by the Earth </p><p>107 </p><p> Mrs. Southerland, who was a walking</p><p>“Who’s Who?” of diabolic memory, and </p><p>who wrote society notes for the Darjiling </p><p>Standard, lost sleep on account of this en- </p><p>gaging young man; for, she reflected, he </p><p>dressed well, and had plenty of time on his </p><p>hands—good omens. Further, the crafty </p><p>old huntress deduced from his apparent si- </p><p>lence and diffidence in the presence of wom- </p><p>en that he would be easy game, and Mrs. </p><p>Southerland had a daughter on her hands </p><p>with a figure like six o’clock and a com- </p><p>plexion that looked as if the moths had got </p><p>at it. </p><p> Wherefore she conspired with an infatu-</p><p>ated subaltern of her string. The man of </p><p>war proclaimed loudly that this was the </p><p>simplest thing imaginable. Why, he would </p><p>confront him and ask him. point-blank. </p><p>And, with the sheet-metal sensibilities of </p><p>many of his kind, he did. </p><p> His colossal vanity lured him to select</p><p>the club, of all places, as the scene of his </p><p>discomfiture. With fatuous confidence he </p><p>tackled Renshawe in the midst of a group </p><p>who had appealed to him to settle a point </p><p>of dispute about the best means of hunting </p><p>mountain-sheep; for somehow people had </p><p>got into the habit of going to Renshawe for </p><p>information, and his information was al- </p><p>ways direct and accurate. The military </p><p>genius broke in on the conversation with </p><p>what he considered the psychological force </p><p>of direct and unexpected attack. </p><p> “What’s that?" said Renshawe, hardly</p><p>believing that he had heard aright. </p><p> The trained lighting unit repeated—</p><p> “We were wondering what you intended</p><p>to give as your ostensible means of liveli- </p><p>hood for the new census, old man, and—er, </p><p>we-” </p><p> “Ah, I see. And you thought you'd ask</p><p>raet&gt; That 'vas extraordinarily clever of </p><p>you.” 1 he same careless smile llitted over </p><p>the lace, but the voice dropped to an even </p><p>monotone. “I make my livelihood, Duch-</p><p>esne, by attending very carefully and most </p><p>conscientiously to my business.” </p><p> Which, of course, was an insult, direct</p><p>and llagrant; and the officer and gentleman </p><p>should have properly resented it. But even </p><p>while his face flushed and a blustering an- </p><p>swer rose to his lips the cold, colorless light </p><p>from the other's eyes, like a reflection from </p><p>his own beloved snow-peaks, seared into the </p><p>lieutenant’s soul. His eyeglass melted out </p><p>of his eye, and he withdrew. </p><p> Renshawe went on quietly explaining that</p><p>one of the youngest males is usually posted </p><p>as a lookout, while the oldest and best head, </p><p>following some mysterious instinct of self- </p><p>preservation, nearly always managed to </p><p>surround himself with females. </p><p> This was the man wrho couldn't play bil-</p><p>liards, and whose partner cursed him soul- </p><p>fully while he smiled apologetically. </p><p> WAS it Ruskin who remarked, after</p><p>watching a young man who played </p><p>an extraordinarily good game, </p><p>“There is the result of a wasted youth?” </p><p>Meaning presumably that the same time </p><p>and perseverance might have been spent to </p><p>so much better advantage. </p><p> Nobody could accuse Renshawe in this</p><p>respect; his life had been too strenuous. At </p><p>baseball he wras a joke. Cricket, to which </p><p>the English pray, was of course a sealed </p><p>book to him. At football he was futile. </p><p>Tennis, to him, meant a series of terrific </p><p>smashes that lost countless balis and ruined </p><p>many rackets. </p><p> All the more refined and less profitable</p><p>games found him wanting; but he could </p><p>handle a sword like an officer of the Foreign </p><p>Legion, he could box like an American, he </p><p>could wrestle with all the skill and cunning </p><p>of a Jap; and rolling these all into one, he </p><p>could fight like—well, as little’ Shannon, a </p><p>profane but invaluable member of the Secret </p><p>Service, who had once experienced the joy </p><p>of witnessing him in action, said, he could </p><p>fight like- </p><p> But these accomplishments were not of</p><p>the kind that are usually displayed before </p><p>an audience of admiring girls; wherefore </p><p>many of the perspicacious folk among whom </p><p>he lived regarded Renshawe with something </p><p>of pity and condescension. </p><p> And Renshawe was perfectly well aw’are</p><p>of it, and smiled away in complete and </p><p>glorious indifference to their opinions. </p><p> Secret Service — Renshawe’s frequent</p><p>mysterious disappearances led many who </p><p>knew him to speculate on this as his profes-</p><p>sion. But others, who knew him better, </p><p>said no. Renshawe w’as the kind of turbu- </p><p>lent and restless spirit that would never tie </p><p>itself dowMi to hold a job from anv boss— </p><p>much less the Government of India, which </p><p>meant many bosses, each with a completely </p><p>developed idea of his own Heaven-designed </p><p>magnificence. </p><p> And they were right. Yet Secret Service</p><p>io8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>was as near as one might well get to de- </p><p>scribing his profession. He was what the </p><p>Natives call a “Go-Get-It-Man.” He ac- </p><p>cepted commissions to procure anything </p><p>from an ancient piece of china to a rare or- </p><p>chid or a young rhinoceros. </p><p> This repertoire included valuable infor-</p><p>mation, in which connection he had, on </p><p>several occasions, worked for the Secret </p><p>Service. But he insisted on working inde- </p><p>pendently, and strictly for results; he re- </p><p>fused to cumber his time with tedious re- </p><p>ports as to the how and why; he invariably </p><p>procured what was required and declined </p><p>to enter into long explanations, much to </p><p>the inward rage of tape-bound officials. </p><p>But still it was Renshawe they sent for </p><p>when their own men failed, and Renshawe </p><p>took a diabolic delight in treating them all </p><p>as if they were plain human beings instead </p><p>of gods, and in conscientiously flouting all </p><p>prescribed, and therefore reverenced, pro- </p><p>cedure. </p><p> This was the man who cheerfully ac-</p><p>quiesced while his partner beat upon his </p><p>breast and called him a diplodocus, and an </p><p>abysmal anthropoid. But then his small </p><p>experience of billiards had been snatched </p><p>during the infrequent and limited periods </p><p>between his strenuous expeditions, which </p><p>he called loafing. He had never been able </p><p>to loaf long enough to acquire skill in games. </p><p>Even the present period had reached its </p><p>limit, and while his partner was still groan- </p><p>ing, a servant announced with diffidence </p><p>that a messenger insisted on seeing the Sa- </p><p>hib immediately. </p><p> Renshawe excused himself and went out;</p><p>but the unprecedented occurrence of a na- </p><p>tive insisting on seeing a white man was so </p><p>extraordinary that the others followed. </p><p> “Now we’re going to butt in on Billy’s</p><p>business,” shouted one of them boister- </p><p>ously. </p><p> Renshawe looked rather annoyed at the</p><p>intrusion; then he looked at the messenger, </p><p>and grinned all around to the back of his</p><p>neck. </p><p> “What the devil is he chortling about?”</p><p>queried the partner. </p><p> Renshawe grinned some more, and then</p><p>turned slowly and addressed the man in the </p><p>Lepcha dialect. He had recognized the </p><p>man’s tribe at a glance, and he knew that </p><p>there were only three white men in the </p><p>world who could speak the language of the </p><p>aboriginal hill-folk. </p><p> “Well, I’ll be double -!” announced</p><p>the most eager of the interlopers in disgust </p><p>as he led the way back to the billiard-room. </p><p>“Boy! I require drink. Peg, bring it. </p><p>What’s yours, you fellows? Renshawe, </p><p>you’re an outcast; we drink alone.” </p><p> “Well?” inquired Renshawe of the mes-</p><p>senger. </p><p> “Sahib, there is one down at Bhutia Busti</p><p>arrived from the north who would speak </p><p>with thee on a matter of importance, with- </p><p>out delay.” </p><p> “What is the affair, and who is the man</p><p>who desires me to make this long journey </p><p>at such short notice?” </p><p> “Sahib, the affair I know* not; it is secret.</p><p>And the man is a stranger—from Tibet. </p><p>His speech shows that he is no Bhutia.” </p><p>“That seems to me insufficient cause to </p><p>make so long a journey.” </p><p> “That is in the Sahib’s decision. But the</p><p>man sent a sign, saying, ‘Show this to the </p><p>white man, and he will come.’ ” </p><p> He groped in his bosom and produced a</p><p>short stick of some dark wood, abr ut si\ </p><p>inches long, and exquisitely carved with </p><p>Kiang-Hsi characters. </p><p> Renshawe did not need to take it into his</p><p>hand. </p><p> “It is sufficient,” he said quietly. *'I</p><p>come within the hour.” </p><p>HE STRODE back to the billiard- </p><p>room. </p><p> “Awfully sorry, you fellows,” he</p><p>began. “I must beg oa the rest of the </p><p>game. It’s a matter of business which calls </p><p>me to Bhutia Busti. I’ll finish the match </p><p>tonight if you don’t mind waiting.” </p><p> “Tonight! Hear him! Why man, there's</p><p>no horse in Darjiling that can take you </p><p>down to the Bhutia village and back by to- </p><p>night.” </p><p> “I know it; an’ I ain' a goin’ to ride no</p><p>hawse. My go walkee, wralkee. But I’ll </p><p>have to hurry. So long; reserve the table </p><p>for after dinner. I’ll surely be back and </p><p>help Crandall lose his money.” </p><p> He strode out, full of energy and \itality</p><p>as a storage battery, singing, “Chid mera </p><p>burria Tum-muka-loo," which is a lewd song </p><p>of the bazaars, to the huge delight of the </p><p>club porter. But the significance of the </p><p>song was lost on the white men, who merely </p><p>grunted and called for more refreshment. </p><p> “If he gets back bv tonight,” announced</p><p>Topleigh, “I’ll eat the doth off the oldest </p><p>The Oath by the Earth </p><p>109 </p><p>table in the club. It’s twelve miles and a </p><p>drop of over five thousand feet.” </p><p> "And I’ll eat a set of snooker balls,” sup-</p><p>plemented Crandall. “A Paliari might do </p><p>it, but there’s been no European since old </p><p>Cristensen’s time who’d come near it.” </p><p> But Renshawe never troubled to inquire</p><p>what other people had done before him: he </p><p>invariably set out to do his little best, which </p><p>was, a? often as not, just a little better than </p><p>the other fellow's. </p><p> He traveled by the sheer up-and-down</p><p>choor-batos of the hill-folk, and arrived </p><p>at Bhutia Busti in just one hour and a </p><p>half. </p><p> In the old tumble-down serai he found an</p><p>aged lama just preparing to receive him, for </p><p>the messenger had arrived only a few min- </p><p>utes before. The old man apologized pro- </p><p>fusely with infinite courtesy and peered at </p><p>him through his great tortoise-shell-rimmed </p><p>spectacles. Then: </p><p> “Ait, aie. Just such a man as I was</p><p>told.'1 he muttered, and meandered off into </p><p>a long Buddhist platitude on the virtues of </p><p>promptness. </p><p> “My father, I have need of haste,” gent-</p><p>ly reminded Renshawe. </p><p> ‘‘Ah, I might have known; such a man is</p><p>ever in a hurry. It is well. My son, you </p><p>have seen the sign?” </p><p> “Yes, my father. I know it well. It is</p><p>from theTesho-Lama at Lhassa, and I came, </p><p>as you see, with speed.” </p><p> ‘‘Good! The Great One said it would be</p><p>even so. And he bade me remind you of a </p><p>certain promise and say that the time was </p><p>now come when you could-receive back </p><p>your word by performing a service.” </p><p> ‘T hear.”</p><p> “My son, the matter stands thus. At</p><p>the time of the great tribulation—” he re- </p><p>ferred to the recent Tibet Expedition, when, </p><p>lor the first time in history, a foreign force </p><p>had entered the Forbidden Citv — “the </p><p>(,reat Buddha with its attendant images </p><p>was hidden from the eyes of the foreign </p><p>evils; vet, for our sins in a past existence,</p><p>happened that some impious hand dis- </p><p>covered the hiding-place and stole away the </p><p>Six lesser images. These, with much labor, </p><p>we have since been tracing, and in this mat- </p><p>ter lies the service.” </p><p> The old man peered narrowly at Ren-</p><p>shawe again to observe what effect his </p><p>speech was having. He might as well have </p><p>gazed at the Sphinx. </p><p> “My father’s words have my attention,”</p><p> said Renshawe gravely.</p><p> The lama continued:</p><p> “The image of silver, my son, which is as</p><p> prescribed in the attitude of the Oath by</p><p> the Earth with the great emerald set in the</p><p> breast, we have followed through many</p><p> hands till it has lately come into the posses-</p><p> sion of one Lutf-Ullah, a Dorabi. To him</p><p> we sent an emissary to obtain the same by</p><p> purchase; but the man is a man of vio-</p><p> lence. He slew our messenger, and is now</p><p> returned to his own country. Therefore,</p><p>my son-” </p><p> He paused with an expressive and inquir-</p><p> ing look.</p><p> “What is the man’s village?” said Ren-</p><p> shawe noncommittally.</p><p> “Nay, we know* not. He is of the Zukkha</p><p> Khel, and was formerly a Dorabi in the</p><p> Battery regiment.”</p><p> Renshawe grunted and muttered, more</p><p>to himself than to the old man: </p><p> “Hm! .And the Tesho-Lama wants me</p><p>to hunt up this cut-throat among his own </p><p>people across the Afghan border and get </p><p>the goods? A long quest, my father, and a </p><p>difficult. Is there no further i dentin cation </p><p>of the man?” </p><p> “Nay, my son, that is all. But this we</p><p> know: the man is tall, having a black beard,</p><p> and fierce. It is little enough; but the Great</p><p> One said there was no other in his knowl-</p><p> edge who could undertake the matter.”</p><p> "Hm!” Renshawe grunted again, and sat</p><p> a long time thinking.</p><p> “There is also suitable reward,” the old</p><p> man insinuated.</p><p> “I had no thought for that, my father:</p><p> where the Tesho-Lama is concerned there is</p><p> no need of bargaining. But this thing needs</p><p> haste.”</p><p> “It is indeed so, my son. Lest he sell,</p><p> and the image be lost again.”</p><p> “And I await a letter of much importance</p><p> from my own country, which is not due for</p><p> at least a week.”</p><p> He thought a while longer in silence,</p><p>while the old man watched him anxiously.</p><p> At last he arose, and his face showed that</p><p> he had not a care in the world. The lama</p><p> rose too, but his face was sorrowful.</p><p> ”1 see that my son has surely put this</p><p> trouble away from him. The Great One's</p><p> spirit will be heavy.”</p><p> But that was only Renshawe’s way.</p><p>Having once come to a decision, his soul was </p><p>no </p><p>Adventure </p><p>free from care. Sufficient to the day was </p><p>the evil thereof. </p><p> “Nay, ray father," he said. “I start with</p><p>tomorrow’s sun.” </p><p> The old man gaped with surprise; then</p><p>he bowed to the ground. </p><p> “It is even as the Great One said,” he</p><p>muttered. </p><p>THE same evening Renshawe fell </p><p>like a bomb into the club. Not that </p><p>his coming was noisy; he walked in </p><p>with the springy silent tread of the jungle- </p><p>man, but his appearance struck at least </p><p>three of the members like a Nihilist demon- </p><p>stration. </p><p> Renshawe played execrably, but Crandall</p><p>was too overcome by the shameful knowl- </p><p>edge of his indigestible wager to raise a mur- </p><p>mur. </p><p> “Well, it’s good night, and good-by for a</p><p>while, you fellows,” said Renshawe when it </p><p>was all over, and Crandall had paid his </p><p>share. “I have to start for the Punjab fron- </p><p>tier tomorrow." </p><p> “Hear him talk about the Punjab fron-</p><p>tier as if it were only a week’s journey!” </p><p> Renshawe grinned.</p><p> “And say, I wish you’d tell the clerk to</p><p>hold ali mail till I come back; I don’t want </p><p>it chasing all over the country after me and </p><p>never finding me. Don’t forget; this is im- </p><p>portant, now.” </p><p> And the letter that Renshawe was so ex-</p><p>ercised about? That leads back to a year </p><p>ago; and, of course, to a girl. </p><p> Renshawe had accumulated enough sa-</p><p>vings to take a trip home and visit his peo- </p><p>ple; and there he had met the most won- </p><p>derful girl in all the world, and, after the </p><p>manner of strong men who have found but </p><p>little time to cultivate women, he wondered </p><p>how she had escaped from Heaven, and </p><p>poured out seven years of pent-up devotion </p><p>at her feet. He was a new type in her mi- </p><p>croscopic orbit, this clean-cut man of swift </p><p>decision; and she had proceeded with alac- </p><p>rity to add his scalp to her collection. Then, </p><p>another man had come. Scalps, the exact</p><p>counterpart of his, hung at her belt in rows, </p><p>for she was very beautiful. There was noth- </p><p>ing new about him. Bui—he possessed a </p><p>motor-car; which, of course, made decision </p><p>a matter of much difficulty. </p><p> Hitherto the most wonderful girl had</p><p>found no trouble in controlling a many- </p><p>stringed bow with neatness and despatch; </p><p>but Renshawe was not of those lesser ani- </p><p>mals that are content to hunt in packs. His </p><p>nature was too big to crave the support or </p><p>tolerate the presence of others on his trails. </p><p>Wherefore, since he was a product of cen- </p><p>turies of Western civilization, and very </p><p>much a man, he did not fall upon his rival </p><p>and rend him with his teeth; but instead </p><p>proposed very gently to the girl that, since </p><p>he had to return to his work shortly in any </p><p>case, he would give her a year in which to </p><p>make up her mind, at the end of which time </p><p>she should write and communicate her de- </p><p>cision. </p><p> This she promised with tears and soft</p><p>clinging arms, and many protestations that </p><p>there was no need—she knew her mind. </p><p>But the next day she went for an automo- </p><p>bile ride just the same—West is West. </p><p>YAR MAHOMED of the Zukkha </p><p>Khel clan climbed swiftly up a steep </p><p>spur of the Sufed Koh range that </p><p>overhung the Peiwar Kotal pass, and grunt- </p><p>ed fiercely as he swung his long limbs fr&lt; m </p><p>crag to crag, leaping, clutching and scram- </p><p>bling as only a born mountaineer can. </p><p> Arrived at the summit, he wriggled into</p><p>a nook well down from the skyline and </p><p>peered out along the winding track that led </p><p>through the Kurrum valley over the border </p><p>into India. </p><p> He crouched, all careless of the precipice</p><p>sheer to the pass at his side, and gazed out </p><p>under his pent brows like some grim bird of </p><p>prey. His keen, dark face with its great </p><p>hooked nose and fierce eyes, and the very </p><p>posture of his body, bunched forward with </p><p>the lean neck outstretched, heightened the </p><p>impression of a great eagle watching for its </p><p>victim. </p><p> The eyes were the most peculiar part of</p><p>the man—swift and keen, flashing inces- </p><p>santly from point to point. Not by any </p><p>means shift)' or afraid, but the alert eyes of </p><p>the untamed creature constantly on the </p><p>lookout for danger and prepared to mini- </p><p>mize it by meeting it more than half-way. </p><p> After a long and careful scrutiny the grim</p><p>mouth curled in disgust and the man spat </p><p>vindictivelv into the pass below.</p><p> “Thukka-AUahl The dog delays,” he</p><p>muttered, and his talons curled caressingly </p><p>around the stock of his rifle, a beautiful </p><p>weapon which carried its own story. </p><p> For a long while he brooded, for all the</p><p>world like a larger and tierccr edition of </p><p>The Oath by the Earth </p><p>in </p><p>William Tell waiting for his Gessler. Then </p><p>he spat again and climbed slowly down with </p><p>the comforting reflection that if Ailah </p><p>willed, tomorrow; or if not, the day after; </p><p>or the day after that. All time was before </p><p>him; and, being an Oriental, he was blessed </p><p>with infinite patience. </p><p> Yar Mahomed was by profession a man;</p><p>and according to the conventions of his </p><p>race and that part of the world he fiUed his </p><p>job very thoroughly. That is to say, he </p><p>made war upon his neighbors and hated his </p><p>enemies. In these degenerate times of </p><p>peace, and since the influence of the British </p><p>had begun to make itself felt, it was aston- </p><p>ishing how far a man of action had to travel </p><p>to find suitable neighbors. </p><p> But whether on the Kurrum border, or</p><p>down among the Beluchis, or away up in </p><p>Baltistan, wherever there were wars and </p><p>rumors of wars, Yar Mahomed arrived soon- </p><p>er or later with his trusty rifle—an older </p><p>and less satisfactory one; of the present </p><p>weapon more anon—to enlist his services </p><p>on whichever side looked like winning; for </p><p>there would be the most loot. For the rest, </p><p>he was scrupulously honest, true to his salt, </p><p>and possessed a very' fine conception of his </p><p>personal honor, an insult to which he would </p><p>resent with an immediate knife-stroke. A </p><p>whole man. </p><p> The rifle needs special mention to itself;</p><p>for in that country the rifle is quite half the </p><p>man. Yar Mahomed had long been dissat- </p><p>isfied with the weapon he had been carrying. </p><p>It was an old Martini-Henry, acquired in </p><p>one of the innumerable border-skirmishes </p><p>with the British, and had supplanted his </p><p>yet older native-made JezaiJ. For a Jong </p><p>while his heart had been content; but there </p><p>came a time when he had temporarily hired </p><p>himself as a guide to a sporting Englishman </p><p>who had come into the mountains to shoot. </p><p> This man possessed a wonderful weapon</p><p>which would carry true as a hair for a thou- </p><p>sand yards, and good enough to be certain </p><p>o	y°ur man for a considerable distance far-</p><p>, r: anc* ^ar Mahomed’s soul lusted for </p><p>the beautiful thing. But he had taken the </p><p>white man s pay, and therefore figuratively</p><p>eaten his salt, and the rifle with all the </p><p>other possessions of the white man were ti- </p><p>ered. </p><p> \ar Mahomed beat his breast and groan-</p><p>ed in anguish; and shortly Allah rewarded </p><p>his honesty. The Englishman was so </p><p>pleased with his guide in every way that he </p><p>confidcd to him that a friend of his, a young </p><p>lord from England, desired to come on a </p><p>similar trip, and that he would surely tell </p><p>his friend to seek out this prince among </p><p>guides. The friend would be due in Bannu </p><p>on the British side on such and such a date. </p><p> Yar Mahomed went out and prostrated</p><p>himself many times to the West. Allah </p><p>was God, Allah was good. In shallahl </p><p> I	have said that Yar Mahomed was strict-</p><p>ly honest; and he was, as was proven in the </p><p>case of the Englishman. He would have </p><p>stabbed anybody without hesitation who </p><p>would have suggested to him that he should </p><p>steal a horse, or a rupee, or a handful of </p><p>grain. But rifles and ammunition are the </p><p>gifts of God to mankind, free as the air they </p><p>breathe and the water they drink, and as </p><p>such belong naturally to whoever can ac- </p><p>quire them and keep them. </p><p> Yar Mahomed praised God for his</p><p>bounty, and was very sure to make no mis- </p><p>take about eating salt this time. The </p><p>lordling arrived and went into camp with </p><p>strange guides, Punjabi Dogras, recom- </p><p>mended by the Commissioner. It was </p><p>child's play. The lordling slept as they </p><p>sleep whose lives have been spent in per- </p><p>petual security, and the Dogras were stuffed </p><p>with unwonted luxury in the neighboring </p><p>tent—and the moon was flecked with fleet- </p><p>ing shadows- </p><p> It was, as I have said, a beautiful weapon</p><p>—a Ballard .303, high velocity, bolt-action; </p><p>and .\llah had further provided two hun- </p><p>dred rounds of ammunition. </p><p> This was the man who daily climbed the</p><p>Sufed Koh and perched above the Feiwar </p><p>Kotal gazing across the valley with hungry </p><p>eyes. </p><p>OF COURSE there was a girl in it, </p><p>or rather, as they arc there desig- </p><p>nated, a woman. The most won- </p><p>derful woman in all the world—tall, and </p><p>straight as a young pine from carrying </p><p>water-jars on her head. Yar Mahomed </p><p>went straight to her father and offered forty- </p><p>five good silver rupees, which was all he </p><p>possessed. </p><p> The old man demurred; the girl was tall</p><p>and strong, and would be able to extort</p><p>quite an extensive patch of corn out of the </p><p>bleak mountain side. Thereupon the ar- </p><p>dent young man, with all the impetuosity </p><p>of a lover, offered his old rifle, the Martini- </p><p>Henry, which was really worth five or .-is </p><p>I 12 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>girls. The old man snatched at the chance, </p><p>and the bargain was struck. </p><p> Now it happened that there was some</p><p>small bickering among the Waziri tribes, </p><p>and thither hastened Yar Mahomed in the </p><p>hope of acquiring the wherewithal to set up </p><p>housekeeping. He left the most beautiful </p><p>embodiment of all the virtues in the care </p><p>of her father, with many injunctions re- </p><p>garding her safe-keeping; quite forgetful, in </p><p>his new sense of proprietorship, of the fact </p><p>that the old man had managed to keep her </p><p>in perfect safety hitherto. This duty ac- </p><p>complished, he cast care to the winds and </p><p>hurried away, scenting the battle from afar, </p><p>with eager, hawk’s face and distended nos- </p><p>trils. </p><p> Meanwhile a cousin of his own family—</p><p>a low fellow and a renegade, for he had </p><p>taken service with the Indian Government </p><p>—came home on leave and swaggered </p><p>among the hill villages, twirling his mus- </p><p>tache with a military air. And his evil fate </p><p>brought it about that he, too, saw the </p><p>woman. He made haste to meet the father, </p><p>and was apprised of the bargain already </p><p>struck with Yar Mahomed. </p><p> But the cousin was not bound by any fool-</p><p>ish tribal conventions of honor; he was an </p><p>enlightened man, he had traveled afar and </p><p>seen the ways of the white men. He went </p><p>direct to the woman and explained how he </p><p>had many rupees saved up from his pay, </p><p>and, above all, that he was a servant of the </p><p>Sirkar and would eventually retire on a </p><p>pension. Can the woman be blamed? </p><p> Yar Mahomed returned in due course,</p><p>but, contrary to the procedure of Western </p><p>civilization, was not immediately informed </p><p>by sundry dear friends of the new state of </p><p>affairs. Across the border, where strife </p><p>means knife, swift and straight to the mark, </p><p>those who are wise are very careful to keep </p><p>out of other people’s quarrels* excepting al- </p><p>ways blood feuds, which arc a matter of re- </p><p>ligious duty. </p><p> Wherefore it was some little time before</p><p>Yar Mahomed discovered what his cousin </p><p>had done to him; and, since he was the </p><p>product of centuries of Eastern civilization, </p><p>and very much a man, he set about seeking</p><p>his cousin’s blood. </p><p> But his cousin’s leave had expired and he</p><p>had returned to the protection of the Sir- </p><p>kar; and further, Yar Mahomed learned, </p><p>his regiment, had been ordered to a far coun- </p><p>try, called Tibet. </p><p> That was two years ago; and word had</p><p>now come through other soldiers on leave </p><p>that the man was about to return to his </p><p>own country. </p><p> Which explains why Yar Mahomed</p><p>perched ominously on his pinnacle, shading </p><p>his eyes under his hand and gazing so in- </p><p>tensely across the valley of Kurrum. </p><p> On the fourteenth day his patience was</p><p>rewarded; and he regarded the omen js </p><p>good, for there were just thirteen little nicks </p><p>in the stock of his new rifle, and just room </p><p>for one more before commencing a new line. </p><p>A speck had appeared in the far distance of </p><p>the winding track, and long before it came </p><p>within range Y'ar Mahomed, with the ab- </p><p>normal vision of the bird he so closely re- </p><p>sembled, had made it out to be the man he </p><p>sought. </p><p> He might have dropped him at twelve</p><p>hundred yards with reasonable certainty by </p><p>resting his rifle on a rock, and that would </p><p>have been quite in keeping with the feudist </p><p>ethics of his people; but Yar Mahomed, </p><p>I	have said, was by profession a man.</p><p> He clambered sw’iftly down and hid in</p><p>the pass till he could be reasonably certain </p><p>that his enemy might not escape. Then he </p><p>cautiously raised his head above the level of </p><p>his sheltering rock and yelled: </p><p> “Ahoo, Lutf - UUah, cousin of mine!</p><p>Greeting!” </p><p> Lutf-Ullah dived behind a rock with the</p><p>speed of a great hairy tarantula which he </p><p>resembled, and brought his gun to the front </p><p>before looking to see where the hail came </p><p>from. </p><p> Yar Mahomed shouted like a schoolboy</p><p>with glee at the surprise he had caused, and </p><p>called again. </p><p> "It is met. It is well met, my cousin,</p><p>servant of the Sirkar, who wouldst have </p><p>had a pension if thou hadst lived/' </p><p> Lutf-Ullah’s reply was a shot that plowed</p><p>up the ground twenty yards short. He was </p><p>a soldier, and therefore no marksman. </p><p> He fired three times more while the other</p><p>waited with cold-blooded alertness. Am- </p><p>munition is always a scarcity across the bor- </p><p>der, and Yar Mahomed wanted to make </p><p>quite certain of his first shot. </p><p> He did. As the crashing echoes raced</p><p>down the overhanging cliffs he coolly blew </p><p>the smoke from his barrel and strode down </p><p>the pass. He surveyed the scene grimly </p><p>and nodded his head with satisfaction. </p><p> “A good shot and a dean," he muttered.</p><p>The Oath by the Earth </p><p>113 </p><p> Then he took the rifle and cartridges, for</p><p>they are legitimate loot; and, since Lutf- </p><p>Ullah had been of his own family, he cov- </p><p>ered the body with boulders. After which </p><p>he strode off with the feeling of a man who </p><p>has accomplished a duty well done. </p><p> And when the woman would have turned</p><p>to him again with the submission of the </p><p>primitive female to the victor, his eyes </p><p>flashed, and he spat on the ground and </p><p>turned his broad shoulders in the utter- </p><p>most scorn. East is East. </p><p>II </p><p>“But there is neither East nor West, border nor </p><p> breed nor birth,</p><p>"When two sirong men stand face to face, though </p><p> they come from the ends of the earth.’'</p><p>AR MAHOMED returned to his own </p><p>village of Munrood to rest up a while. </p><p>His hands were clean and his conscience </p><p>was clear, and he was respected of all men, </p><p>for he had made his honor white. Further, </p><p>he was a rich man, possessor of two good </p><p>riiles besides his own, Lutf-Ullah’s, and that </p><p>other, the price of the girl, which he had </p><p>forcibly recovered from the old man under </p><p>a machine-gun hail of curses. </p><p> He decided that he owed himself a holi-</p><p>day after liis weary vigil, and accordingly </p><p>sprawled his great limbs luxuriously on a </p><p>string cot while he opened up negotiations </p><p>to trade the two rifles for the highest he </p><p>could get over and above their weight in sil- </p><p>ver, that being the standard price of a good </p><p>gun across the border. </p><p> His soul was full of content, when there</p><p>dropped a bolt from the blue. News came, </p><p>with the astonishing mouth-to-mouth tele- </p><p>graph of the East, that a certain white man </p><p>was making cautious inquiries among the </p><p>border villages for one Yar Mahomed/ </p><p> This was disquieting. He had no appre-</p><p>hensions about the affair of Lutf-Ullah, for </p><p>that had happened on his side of the border; </p><p>but there had recently been a small matter </p><p>of replenishing ammunition; and as his rifle </p><p>took the .303 government cartridge, what </p><p>more natural than that he should have gone </p><p>across the border for it? True, it had been </p><p>but a trifling affair—only twenty rounds, as </p><p>he indignantly recollected; but these ac-</p><p>cursed Feringees were apt to make such a </p><p>fuss over trifles. </p><p> He decided that he would go up to Haz-</p><p>war and lie quiet till the white man went </p><p>8 </p><p>away again. Not that he was the least bit </p><p>afraid; but the white men had been known </p><p>to raise all sorts of unpleasant complica- </p><p>tions by bringing pressure to bear on the </p><p>maliks, or head men. </p><p> In due course Renshawe arrived at Mun-</p><p>rood and was entertained by the malik. </p><p>His coming had long been expected and </p><p>every move of his had been reported, but </p><p>the old man professed the greatest surprise, </p><p>and gave flowery expression to the honor it </p><p>was to entertain so distinguished-looking a </p><p>stranger. Renshawe gravely partook of the </p><p>proffered meal of greasy kid stew, squatting </p><p>on the floor opposite his host—who, of </p><p>course, did not eat—and conversed on the </p><p>probability of the rainfall, and the possibil- </p><p>ity of the great Bazid-Khel feud breaking </p><p>out again, and every imaginable topic ex- </p><p>cept that which was uppermost in his mind. </p><p>It was not till the hoolLih had been lit and </p><p>passed that he mentioned what he had real- </p><p>ly come for; for this was the custom. </p><p> The wily old malik, with the hereditary</p><p>suspicion of ages, fenced carefully. </p><p> “Yar Mahomed? Yes, Sahib; such a man</p><p>did indeed live here, but he is now absent.’’ </p><p> ‘'That is unfortunate, for I have jour-</p><p>neyed far to have speech with him.” </p><p> “So? This is indeed evil luck; but a week</p><p>ago he was here. And is it permissible to </p><p>inquire what this matter might be? Per- </p><p>haps a messenger might— It is just pos- </p><p>sible if Allah wills. But who can say?" </p><p> Renshawe had to be careful. There was</p><p>no means of finding out how much was </p><p>known about the image. </p><p> “Well,” he said, “it is this. I would pur-</p><p>chase a certain thing that is in his posses- </p><p>sion, a tiling that has come from across the </p><p>border.” </p><p> The old man with difficulty restrained a</p><p>grin. He saw through the whole thing now; </p><p>this foolish Feringee had given the game </p><p>away. A certain thing from across the bor- </p><p>der? Why, of course, that would be his ri- </p><p>fle. Such an old affair as that! Truly these </p><p>white men were persistent! </p><p> And, “purchase?” Did the white man</p><p>think to throw dust in his eyes thus easily? </p><p>How childish he was! Well, he would send </p><p>a messenger to try and overtake Yar Ma- </p><p>homed, but there was no great hope; he had</p><p>gone to Kabul, and he traveled fast. </p><p> Renshawe thanked the crafty old pa-</p><p>triarch and presently withdrew. He knew </p><p>he was lying, but one doesn't voice such </p><p>Adventure </p><p>crude accusations across the bonier. How- </p><p>ever, there were other ways; men could al- </p><p>ways be found, renegades or fugitives from </p><p>other tribes, who would exchange informa- </p><p>tion for money. </p><p>THAT night Yar Mahomed re- </p><p>ceived a message to the effect that </p><p>the unbelieving dog was an officer </p><p>of the Border Police, and that he came for </p><p>the English lord's rille. But that Yar Ma- </p><p>homed might rest in peace, for the Feringee </p><p>was open-faced and foolish, and would ac- </p><p>complish nothing. </p><p> But three days later a breathless runner</p><p>brought nov.v that the Feringee was even </p><p>then making his way to Hazwar. Yar Ma- </p><p>homed hastily gathered up his gear and </p><p>moved far up the mountains to Faizkot, </p><p>leaving information at Hazwar that he had </p><p>gone west to Rohat. Faizkot was an al- </p><p>most inaccessible mountain village, and he </p><p>had yet to meet the white man who could </p><p>follow him in his own mountains. </p><p> In a week a rumor came up of a man win-</p><p>nowing the villages above Hazwar. Yar </p><p>Mahomed cursed gutturally. This Feringee </p><p>was not as others he had met; he was be- </p><p>coming a nuisance. In the first flush of </p><p>fierce rage his primal impulse was to lie in </p><p>wait for him and kill him; but he hesitated </p><p>at that. The killing of a white man brought </p><p>certain trouble with the Sir/far, and the </p><p>paying of heavy fines, and perhaps white </p><p>soldiers quartered in the hill villages; and </p><p>he knew that his private troubles were not </p><p>worth all that to the malika. He doubled </p><p>back to Kurrum. </p><p> To detail the long chase that ensued</p><p>would fill a book. Yar Mahomed broke </p><p>from his more familiar country to the Ghii- </p><p>sai tribes, and from them to the Bazid- </p><p>Khels. For the first time in his life be was </p><p>forced to admit a touch of admiration for </p><p>an unbeliever; and with it a feeling some- </p><p>thing akin to apprehension crept into his </p><p>soul, for there was something terrifying </p><p>about this tireless, silent Nemesis. </p><p> Renshawe stuck doggedly to his quest,</p><p>cruclly handicapped by the universally in- </p><p>stinctive union of the colored man against </p><p>the white. Frequently he lost all trace; the </p><p>tribesmen lied through long habit, and </p><p>whether they knew anything about the</p><p>matter or no, they misdirected him on prin- </p><p>ciple-	. , . •</p><p> But by careful analysis and a judicious</p><p> use ol lus keen knowledge of native char-</p><p>acter he always eventually picked up the </p><p>trail again. Lately, fur a long lime, he had </p><p>not been able to glean any information at </p><p>all. The man seemed to have disappeared </p><p>into the air; and this was because Yar Ma- </p><p>homed, recognizing that information as to </p><p>his whereabouts leaked from the villages, </p><p>had embarked on a new plan of camping </p><p>out on the mountains alone. But Ren- </p><p>shawe was nearer to him than he imagined </p><p>and he became cognizant of the fact with </p><p>startling unpleasantness. </p><p> As Renshawe toiled up a barren slope,</p><p>doggedly but rather hopelessly, out of the </p><p>corner of his eye he caught die puff of a </p><p>thin feather of smoke that flashed out from </p><p>a far ridge. Instantly he threw himself flat </p><p>on his face, and at the same instant a thin </p><p>whine sang over the place where he had </p><p>stood. </p><p> The temptation had been too much for</p><p>Yar Mahomed. Coming over the spur Le </p><p>had caught sight of his enemy, and the swift </p><p>access of rage had overcome all i-ihtr con- </p><p>siderations. The fact that he had lired </p><p>from ambush showed w’hat a demoralizing </p><p>effect this relentless pursuit was having on </p><p>his nerves, if such a man could be said to </p><p>have nerves. </p><p> Some inkling of this found it:, way into</p><p>Renshawe’s mind as he swiftly stalked the </p><p>spot, for he grinned all over his face for the </p><p>first time in many da3rs. He considered </p><p>himself almost at hand-grips now; for, </p><p>though the spot was empty and there was </p><p>no trace on the rocky ground, only a few </p><p>minutes separated him from the man whom </p><p>he had hitherto been regarding as an elusive </p><p>fugitive. But the sudden shot woke him </p><p>up to the fact that he was dealing with a </p><p>dangerous enemy. </p><p> Yar Mahomed, for his part, was thor-</p><p>oughly convinced of the fact. Having once </p><p>opened hostilities, there would be no more </p><p>running away—something which his fierce </p><p>soul had rebelled against from the begin- </p><p>ning. </p><p> The twro men were stalking each other</p><p>now; yet so many hiding-places did the </p><p>mountains offer, and so well did each know </p><p>how to take advantage of them, that it was </p><p>not till the second evening that they came </p><p>together. </p><p> Honors fell to the white man—white now</p><p>only by courtesy; for so sunburnt and gaunt </p><p>was his face from exposure, and so ragged </p><p>The Oath by the Earth </p><p>ii5 </p><p>his khaki shooting-suit, that he might easiJy </p><p>have passed for a Gurkha from his own be- </p><p>loved hills. </p><p> He was cautiously working down a ridge</p><p>when his quick eyes, trained to the obser- </p><p>vation of Nature, noticed a kite wheeling </p><p>lazily in the sky. He watched it critically; </p><p>then he rose with a seraphic grin and drop- </p><p>ped swiftly down the ravine. Woodsman’s </p><p>deduction had told him that the bird was </p><p>watching something alive below; alive and </p><p>active, for it kept its distance. Had the ob- </p><p>ject been sleeping, or perhaps dying, and </p><p>therefore feeble, it would have swung much </p><p>lower; had it been dead, the bird would </p><p>have settled to feed. </p><p> He climbed the other side with eager an-</p><p>ticipation just crackling out of his eyes. </p><p>There would be a fight; this man who had </p><p>given him such a long chase would surely </p><p>fight; and, though it would have been a </p><p>genuine shock to realize it, Renshawe rev- </p><p>eled heathenishly in a good fight. </p><p> He peered carefully over the ridge, and</p><p>almost shouted. Some two hundred yards </p><p>farther, from behind an intervening hog- </p><p>back, rose a thin curl of smoke. He ran </p><p>forward softly, with all the restrained eager- </p><p>ness of a panther following a grazing buck; </p><p>he hurried, bending low, from rock to rock, </p><p>craning his neck over each, and taking the </p><p>craziest chances of making a noise in his </p><p>eagerness to get over loose ground. But at </p><p>the hogback caution returned. With in- </p><p>finite weariness he edged up to eye-level, </p><p>his rifle ready for instant action—and then </p><p>he boldly stood upright. </p><p> A hundred yards further, with his back</p><p>to him, sat a man with a rifle under his </p><p>thigh, preparing a meal. </p><p> Renshawe’s great chest expanded with a</p><p>deep breath. At last! </p><p> HE THRUST his rifle forward and</p><p> hailed.</p><p> "O/te, Yar Mahomed! Yield</p><p>thee! </p><p> And then, curiously enough, Yar Ma-</p><p>homed acted with the same hereditary in- </p><p>stinct that Lutf-Ullah had shown on a very </p><p>similar occasion. He took a flying dive for </p><p>crr’. a.nd .bul,et whizzed past Ren- </p><p>shawe s head while he was almost yet in the </p><p>air. </p><p> And some curious impulse common to</p><p>the type caused Renshawe to throw back </p><p>his head and shout with laughter at the </p><p>ungainly' figure cut by the tall Afghan. </p><p> He lifted his head a trifle incautiously af-</p><p>ter the outburst, and an immediate bullet </p><p>cutting his hair showed him that his oppo- </p><p>nent certainly knew his weapon. </p><p> Curiously enough again, Yrar Mahomed</p><p>once more followed the example set by his </p><p>late cousin. He fired wildly several times. </p><p>But not from nervousness or fear; he was </p><p>consumed with wild rage. The fact alone </p><p>that he was face to face at last with his per- </p><p>secutor was enough to rouse him to fierce </p><p>indignation; and that he, Yar Mahomed, </p><p>had been caught by an unbelieving dog of </p><p>a Feringee was an ineffaceable disgrace. </p><p>The thought drove him nearly frantic. Also </p><p>he had heard the laugh following on his first </p><p>shot, and the knowledge that the accursed </p><p>Feringee mocked him goaded him beyond </p><p>all control of himself. </p><p> And Renshawe, perfectly cool and alert,</p><p>held his fire, just as Yar Mahomed had done </p><p>on that previous occasion. </p><p> Presently a dagger-stroke of thought</p><p>struck through the Afghan’s quivering rage </p><p>with paralyzing force. Ammunition! This </p><p>was ever a scarcity, and Yar Mahomed's </p><p>scanty supply had already been much de- </p><p>pleted in procuring food during the last </p><p>month. A swift inspection of the magazine </p><p>threw him for an instant into a cold sweat,' </p><p>to be followed immediately after by a fresh </p><p>paroxysm of rabid fury-. He had only one </p><p>cartridge left. </p><p> The thought of capture by this accursed</p><p>Feringee was frenzy. He tried to collect </p><p>himself to make an end with his last shot. </p><p>He could do it; he couldn't miss at a hun- </p><p>dred yards if only he got a grip of himself. </p><p>But Yar Mahomed came of a fanatical race; </p><p>he saw a chance—a poor one; snatched at </p><p>it, fired wildly—and then went ghazi. </p><p> Which is akin to amok, with the difference</p><p>that the Ghazi has the Prophet’s assurance </p><p>of certain Paradise if he can but kill one </p><p>Christian before he dies. </p><p> The tension had been too great. Yar Ma-</p><p>homed threw away his rifle and rushed up </p><p>the slope, frothing at the mouth, blazing </p><p>red from his eyes, and howling like a </p><p>chained devil. </p><p> Renshawe stepped out to meet him, and</p><p>without the least flurry brought the sights </p><p>to bear on his broad chest. </p><p> If he had not had such a perfect control</p><p>of a perfect nerve he might have fired; but</p><p>as he waited his mind was running freely, </p><p>ii6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and something out of the centuries of West- </p><p>ern civilization came and implanted a vague </p><p>impression that there was something of au </p><p>unfair advantage in this. And hand in hand </p><p>with it came the startling anomaly of a </p><p>pre-adamite craving to get to grips with the </p><p>enemy. </p><p> Renshawe softly laid down liis rifle and</p><p>drew the wicked Gurkha kukric of his own </p><p>hills from its sheath with a slow, grim smile </p><p>that left his lips parted in an expression of </p><p>fierce eagerness. The joy of battle blazed </p><p>from his eyes. </p><p> Now there was by no means anything of</p><p>chivalrous foolhardiness in this. It had </p><p>been demonstrated time and again in the </p><p>annals of the British army in India that the </p><p>active little Gurkhas armed with their hack- </p><p>ing blade were more than a match, hand to </p><p>hand, for the big Afghans with their stab- </p><p>bing Kkaibari knife. Renshawe was cer- </p><p>tainly carried beyond all resemblance to his </p><p>normal self by the “fierce joy that warriors </p><p>feel,” or he might never have taken such a </p><p>chance; but he felt perfect confidence in his </p><p>own phenomenal quickness and trained </p><p>muscles against a much bigger and clumsier </p><p>opponent. And this is the God-given gift to </p><p>all natural-born fighting-men—the supreme </p><p>confidence of winning. That is why they </p><p>are fighting-men. </p><p> He stepped forward to a level spot and</p><p>waited with tense muscles slightly crouched, </p><p>poised on the balls of his feet, and weaving </p><p>the terrible curved blade in and out before </p><p>him. </p><p> At any other time even such a man as</p><p>Yar Mahomed might well have hesitated, </p><p>and at least fought warily, but he was </p><p>ghazi; he leaped in with a howl and a hiss- </p><p>ing stab of his great three-foot blade. But </p><p>Renshawe easily evaded and returned with </p><p>a swift swing at the stomach after the Gur- </p><p>kha manner. </p><p> Yet the long-limbed fanatic was no nov-</p><p>ice at knif e-play. With a lightning recovery </p><p>he met the blade on his own and whirled </p><p>up for another slashing stroke. </p><p> Renshawe stepped swiftly inside the blow</p><p>so that the man’s arm jarred on liis shoulder; </p><p>and at the same time he drove heavily for </p><p>the neck. And then his heart came up into </p><p>his mouth where he could taste it, for the </p><p>blade caught in the huge iron brooch that </p><p>held the Afghan's sheepskin poshlein to-</p><p>gether at the shoulder, and twisted from his </p><p>hand. </p><p> Yar Mohamed howled aloud with de-</p><p>moniac joy and heaved up his arm for a fi- </p><p>nal stab. Renshawe’s mind worked with </p><p>the speed and accuracy of the well-kept </p><p>machine that it was. In the second that </p><p>elapsed between his disastrous stroke and </p><p>the ret urn he had rejected half a dozen pos- </p><p>sibilities and seized on the one winch would </p><p>serve him best; and here his jiu-jitsu skill </p><p>stood him in good stead. </p><p> He leaped up at the raised arm, and their</p><p>hands met with a soft smack. With a </p><p>peculiar double grip, enclosing hand and hilt, </p><p>he pressed away the driving stroke that </p><p>whizzed by his side like a lightning bolt. </p><p> Again the same thing happened; and</p><p>again. Then Renshawe saw his chance and </p><p>slipped in close, turning his back to his op- </p><p>ponent so that the stabbing arm came down </p><p>over his shoulder. A little farther out. and </p><p>the elbow would have struck his shoulder, </p><p>and the swift jerk that he gave would have </p><p>snapped it like a clay pipe-stem. </p><p> As it was, in his anxiety to gtt well within</p><p>the blow he had not taken into account tl : </p><p>Afghan’s great length of limb; the fulcn m </p><p>of his shoulder caught the upper part oi the </p><p>arm and the snapping WTench only availed </p><p>to jerk the great knife from the paralyzed </p><p>fingers. </p><p>IT WAS man against man now, </p><p>breast against breast; trained mus- </p><p>cle and phenomenal skill against </p><p>brute straigth and berserk fun,-. Their sin- </p><p>ews cracked as they strained and stamped </p><p>over the broken ground, working farther </p><p>and farther down the slope. </p><p> Presently the maniac-light began to d&gt;e</p><p>out of the Afghan’s eyes; the fanatical fury </p><p>had spent itself, and he began to fight with </p><p>more cunning, while he marveled at this </p><p>comparatively small man who stood against </p><p>him so evenly. As they swung with straining </p><p>chests and hissing breath the loose stones </p><p>made foothold impossible, and presently </p><p>they fell to the ground with interlocked </p><p>limbs. </p><p> There the mad struggle continued. They</p><p>rolled ever lower and farther, neither gain- </p><p>ing any marked advantage, and both grow- </p><p>ing equally spent. </p><p> Then a final heave carried them both</p><p>over a small declivity, locked in a single </p><p>clawing mass of venom and fight, which </p><p>struck with a heavy thud and rolled apart. </p><p> Renshawe struggled slowly to his feet,</p><p>The Oath by the Earth </p><p>117 </p><p>badly shaken, and stood panting, expecting </p><p>the other’s attack; till he saw, to his im- </p><p>mense relief, that the Afghan was evidently </p><p>as badly jolted as himself, for he made no </p><p>move to renew the combat. </p><p> And then, as they glared with bloodshot</p><p>eyes and heaving lungs, from a nestling </p><p>mountain village far below floated the boom </p><p>of a gong and the clear call of the muezzin. </p><p> “Ella-a-hi ho Allah! Akhbar Alla-a-ah—</p><p>God is I he God! Praise be to God!” </p><p> Renshawe smiled painfully. The incon-</p><p>gruity of it struck some hidden note of grim </p><p>humor. </p><p> “It is thy time for prayer, O Mussulman</p><p>—perchance the last. Take it,” he advised. </p><p>He felt that he would be glad of the res- </p><p>pite. </p><p> The sweating Mohammedan thought the</p><p>same. As for prayer—well, they were both </p><p>out of reach of weapons and the white man </p><p>could take no advantage; he would show </p><p>him. And forthwith, with superb disdain, </p><p>he turned his back and faced the west. </p><p> “Hear the voice of God!” chanted the</p><p>muezzin. </p><p> And the follower of the Prophet knelt and</p><p>raised his hands to his ears—and the white </p><p>man drew in great life-giving drafts of air </p><p>and thanked his own God for the rest. </p><p> When the last note had died away from</p><p>below, the great Afghan rose gravely and </p><p>surveyed his enemy with a thoughtful look, </p><p>tinged with a man’s admiration for a man. </p><p> “Sahib," he said at length, “what need</p><p>that we two slay one another?” </p><p> “None,” answered Renshawe promptly,</p><p>“if thou wilt but deliver what I seek.” </p><p> The battle-light began to come back in</p><p>the other’s eyes. </p><p>“Give thee my rifle? Nay, it is mine to </p><p>me, by the law of conquest. My life first.” </p><p>Rifle? muttered Renshawe wondering- </p><p>ly. “What need have I of thy rifle?” </p><p>"What matter is it then that thou hast </p><p>followed me for this month past?” </p><p> “The matter of Lutf-Ullah.”</p><p> “That was across the border,” flashed Yar</p><p>Mahomed hotly. “There is no penalty. It </p><p>was a feud according to our custom.” </p><p>"There is no talk of penalty. What have </p><p>I to do with thy feuds? But the matter is </p><p>this. Luti-Ullah had with him a sacred </p><p>image of the Buddha stolen from Tibet- it </p><p>is this that I seek.” </p><p> Yar Mahomed’s face flashed again.</p><p> Na\ , am I a thief? he cried indignantly.</p><p>“If the dog had any image, it is surely with </p><p>his bones even now.” </p><p> Renshawe looked into his eyes long and</p><p>searchingly. Then he nodded slowly. </p><p> “True. I should have known, ' he said.</p><p>“It is truce between us.” </p><p> “It is truce,” repeated Yar Mahomed.</p><p>“My heart is glad. We be men, thou and </p><p>I.” </p><p> Together they clambered somewhat stiff-</p><p>ly up the scene of the late struggle and come </p><p>to the little camp, and the sight of the pre- </p><p>parations reminded Yar Mahomed of his </p><p>need for a meal and rest. </p><p> “The Sahib will eat?” he invited with</p><p>grave courtesy. </p><p> Renshawe signified his willingness, and</p><p>squatted down and waited while the Af- </p><p>ghan kneaded his coarse flour with a little </p><p>water and salt, and patted the flat unleav- </p><p>ened cake between his hands. </p><p> When it was roasted in the ashes the Af-</p><p>ghan broke the cake in two and handed a </p><p>half to Renshawe with a curious look in his </p><p>eyes. Renshawe received it through the </p><p>smoke of the fire and ate. </p><p> Thereafter the Afghan addressed the</p><p>white man as “Brother.” </p><p> LATER, he accompanied him to the</p><p>scene of his blood feud, and showed </p><p>the piled boulders. Renshawe set </p><p>to work to remove these with some misgiv- </p><p>ings. It chilled him to think that perhaps </p><p>the man had sold before leaving India. But </p><p>as the bones, already picked clean by the </p><p>great black ants, were disclosed, there sat </p><p>the beautifully carved figure of dulled silver </p><p>in its proper position, with the fingers of </p><p>the right hand touching the ground in front </p><p>of the knee in the prescribed attitude of ta- </p><p>king the Oath by the Earth; and the great </p><p>emerald winked up at them in the sunlight </p><p>from its breast. </p><p> “Hm!” grunted Renshawe. “That puts</p><p>me quits with the Tesho-Lama. Then he </p><p>looked curiously at Yar Mahomed. </p><p> But the great Afghan leaned gaunt and</p><p>stolid on his rifle. What did he want with </p><p>images and stones? The dead man’s weap- </p><p>on was now his. It was enough. </p><p> They parted at the border, after Ren-</p><p>shawe had shamelessly promised to send </p><p>many pounds of .303 cartridges cunningly </p><p>hidden in kerosene oil-cans, in flagrant de- </p><p>fiance of all government regulations and </p><p>treaties. </p><p>n8</p><p>Adventure </p><p> In the fulfilment of time tie arrived at</p><p>Darjiling and found his letter. The mo- </p><p>mentous missive said “Come,” but not very </p><p>enthusiastically. And Renshawe thought </p><p>for a long time; and curiously enough, the </p><p>more he thought, the more certain became </p><p>the gradually forming conviction of the past </p><p>year that the most wonderful girl was after </p><p>all not quite so wonderful as she had at </p><p>tiiit seemed; and he decided to think a lii- </p><p>tle longer—which was a very lucky escape </p><p>for him. </p><p>ALL of which goes to prove con- </p><p>clusively the great truth that there </p><p>is after all very little diHerencc be- </p><p>tween two strong men—though they corn*.- </p><p>from the ends of the earth. </p><p>vJ'TOLEN THUNDER </p><p>Aldle of Ddwj-on Dayj* </p><p> Alexander</p><p> White</p><p>Author of "The Making of Louis Laver gru," </p><p>l'The Azoic Late," tic. </p><p>J’dmuet </p><p>OYS, boys, throw them cards to </p><p>Heligoland and come on! It’s </p><p>a new strike!’’ </p><p> To Eric Sark, lounging in the</p><p>Northern Light saloon, pipe in mouth and </p><p>one shoulder planted against the wall as he </p><p>absently viewed the pretentious faro games </p><p>scattered about in the middle of the place, </p><p>the words gasped in an excited whisper </p><p>came faintly through the board partition </p><p>against which he leaned and which sepa- </p><p>rated the main room from a smaller and pri- </p><p>vate room at the back. </p><p> In that private room Sark knew that</p><p>“Casino” Charlie, "Ante” Baker, “Slim” </p><p>Sullivan and “Alabama" Ben were sitting in </p><p>at skylimit poker. Also Sark knew the voice </p><p>of the man who had rushed in and inter- </p><p>rupted them as that of “Gunboat” Kane, </p><p>and he shot a swift glance at his partner </p><p>Bassett, to see if Tom had overheard. </p><p> Lolling a few feet distant against the same</p><p>partition, Tom Bassett betrayed his knowl- </p><p>edge by no startled movement, but the mo- </p><p>mentary flash in his eyes told Sark that he </p><p>was wise. Bassett scrutinized for one keen </p><p>second the faro players at the tables in the </p><p>middle of the room, fearful lest the} too had </p><p>overheard, but even as he looked, he real- </p><p>ized that his fears were unfounded, that the </p><p>distance was too great for the faint whisper </p><p>to carry to them. </p><p> His eyes came back to Sark s.</p><p> “Eric,” he spoke up abruptly, “I’ve fig-</p><p>gered out the drift on that upper-tier claim </p><p>of ours on Adams Iiill. Listen! Here’s how </p><p>we’ll work it—or, hold on, I'll draw it for </p><p>you!” </p><p> Producing a pencil, Bassett faced about</p><p>on the board partition and began to sketch </p><p>imaginary designs. Sark, standing atten- </p><p>tive at his elbow, nodded and sprayed the </p><p>smoke about. Vet the eyes of neither man </p><p>were upon the Adams Hill designs. With </p><p>nice discrimination Tom had selected for </p><p>his drawings a pair of wide boards with a </p><p>crack between, and through the crack the </p><p>partners glimpsed the interior of the private </p><p>room. </p><p> There in the middle of the floor posed</p><p>Gunboat Kane in tense entreaty, his body </p><p>bent at the hips, his legs spread wide, one </p><p>El </p><p>Stolen Thunder </p><p>119 </p><p>band beckoning his four friends to come on, </p><p>the other hand pointing imperiously through </p><p>the doorway in the approximate direction </p><p>of the new strike. And at the poker table, </p><p>half out of their chairs, with their cards and </p><p>chips recklessly jumbled together before </p><p>them, Casino, Ante, Slim and Alabama lis- </p><p>tened open-mouthed, wide-eyed, to Gun- </p><p>boat's frantic announcement. </p><p> “Fresno Creek!” whispered Gunboat,</p><p>fighting air. “Halpune struck it. Recorded </p><p>just as the recordin’-oflice closed, and the </p><p>news won't be out till mornin’. In Dawson </p><p>and out again, like a jumpin’-jack, Halpune </p><p>was, but he stopped long enough to show me </p><p>samples. Coarse gold, boys, and flat! </p><p>Savvy that? Four-dollar pans, he says. </p><p>Savvy that, I say? It’s big. It’s moun- </p><p>tainous big. Come on, you muffled mum- </p><p>mies, come on!” </p><p> “Hold on, Gunboat,” Sark and Bassett</p><p>heard Casino command. “Don’t be fool </p><p>enough to run out of the Northern Light </p><p>and down the street. You'll give the whole </p><p>plagued proposition away. We get to act </p><p>slow on this but not waste any time in </p><p>actin’. That’s the play. Stroll out, boys, </p><p>by ones and twos, lightin’ pipes and cigars </p><p>kind of careless as you go. I’ll co.ne last, </p><p>and I’ll leave the light burnin’ here and turn </p><p>the key silent in the door. Locked in, you </p><p>savvy? Everybody’ll think that the game’s </p><p>still on. Nobody’ll know we’re gone till </p><p>we’re staked on Fresno!” </p><p>CASINO waved his comrades out, </p><p>turned up the oil-lamp on the wall</p><p>so that it blazed brighter and fol- </p><p>lowed through the doonvay. In spite of </p><p>his precautions with the key, Tom and Eric </p><p>heard it grate in the lock as Casino slipped </p><p>by the back route out of the Northern Light. </p><p> “Thar’s whar he fools himself,” chuckled</p><p>Bassett in an undertone. “We know, and </p><p>we 11 sure make urgent use of our knowl- </p><p>edge. But foller Casino’s cue, Eric, and </p><p>eschew the dash. Walk funereally slow' and </p><p>whistle the Dead March in Saul. Now,” </p><p>raising his voice incisively and tapping the </p><p>pseudo designs with an air of finality, “we’ll </p><p>go back to our cabin, pardner, put this on </p><p>paper and scale out the measurements of </p><p>the same. What do you say?” </p><p> “All right," agreed Sark, casting a last</p><p>ealculftbng glanCe at Tom’s hieroglyphics. </p><p>It looks good to me.” </p><p> So the two turned down the smoky in-</p><p>terior of the Northern Light between the </p><p>crowded faro, roulette and poker tables, </p><p>pausing quite naturally here and there to </p><p>w'atch for a second the dealers dealing </p><p>“bank,” to note the number of the pocket </p><p>into which the spinning ivory ball dropped </p><p>or to see four aces or a royal flush sweep a </p><p>glutted jack-pot. They passed nods and </p><p>fleeting jokes with many men of their ac- </p><p>quaintance who, for all they knew, might </p><p>presently be racing at their heels, and finally </p><p>lounged sedately out of the front doonvay. </p><p> But once outside in the twilight night of</p><p>Spring, sedateness utterly vanished, and the </p><p>partners raced straight for the riverbank. </p><p> “We gotta be mighty sprightly, Eric,”</p><p>confided Bassett as they ran. “Fresno </p><p>Creek ain’t very far away from Dawson,— </p><p>only about fourteen miles or so. If the news </p><p>gets spread, there’ll be one rampant rush. </p><p>And it wron’t be a long, survival-of-the- </p><p>fittest stampede with leather lungs and iron </p><p>legs winnin’ out. It’ll be a scrumptious </p><p>sprint. The hundred-yard man with the </p><p>spiked soles’ll bring home the beans. Pard- </p><p>ner, kin you run fourteen miles at one </p><p>splurge without get tin’ spiflication of the </p><p>system?” </p><p> “I can if you can,” declared Sark. “But</p><p>I’d sooner pole it than sprint it. Aren’t you </p><p>going by the Yukon River?” </p><p> “Nope, the land trail’s shorter. We’ll</p><p>make it rapider. Casino and his bunch is </p><p>certain strides ahead of us now. That’s the </p><p>way they’ll go, sure, down the Yukon, and </p><p>wre’U take a cut-off and beat-” </p><p> Bassett did not finish his sentence, for the</p><p>foremost of five running figures, swinging</p><p>out of one of the side streets of the water- </p><p>front, collided breast to breast with him. </p><p>Tom staggered sidewise, doing a crawl </p><p>stroke in the atmosphere to recover his </p><p>balance and at the same time spouting </p><p>trenchant phrases denouncing the other’s </p><p>stupidity. </p><p> “Shut up, Tom!” admonished Sark.</p><p>“This is no time to air yourself like that. </p><p>You’ve got a bellow like the trump of doom, </p><p>and you’ll rout out all Dawson’s living and </p><p>dead. Shut up, I say!” </p><p> “You ain’t—got hit!” puffed Tom. “Ask</p><p>—the other feller—whar’s the—fire?” </p><p> The other man referred to had likewise</p><p>recoiled. He came forward again, rubbing </p><p>his shoulder and breathing strange epigrams, </p><p>very softly spoken, into the fog. </p><p> “I agree with your partner, stranger,” he</p><p>120 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>complained. “You ain't got no call to </p><p>clamor aloud and make a fuss over an acci- </p><p>dent. You were runnin’ like you might have </p><p>been biddin’ the police good-by yourself. </p><p>Where in tarnation you both goin’ so fast?” </p><p>SARK caught something familiar </p><p>in the tone, and he stepped close to </p><p>scan the speaker’s face and the faces </p><p>of the other four. </p><p> “Hello, Casino!” he greeted. “Hello,</p><p>Ante, Gunboat, Slim and Alabama I The </p><p>same salute to you. Where in thunder you </p><p>going so fast?” </p><p> “We were chasm’ one of my dogs,” ex-</p><p>plained Casino hastily. “The brute swiped </p><p>a big chunk of bacon. You seen him?” </p><p>“No," returned Eric dryly. “What kind </p><p>of dog?” </p><p> “Malemut,” Casino blurted. “A lop-</p><p>eared malemut with a yellow mane and </p><p>trace-galls on his flanks.” </p><p> “Never saw a hair of him,” Sark reassert-</p><p>ed. “But we’ll sure help you find him.” </p><p>“No, no, don’t bother, boys! I got </p><p>enough help to bag him now. He must have </p><p>scooted down along the riverbank. We’ll </p><p>just sneak after him till we get him cor- </p><p>nered.” </p><p> “All right, then, but Tom and I’ll just</p><p>amble along behind and see the fun.” </p><p>“Don’t! Don’t, I say!” Casino vehe- </p><p>mently objected, shaking warning hands. </p><p>“Don’t you do it, boys. You’ll stampede </p><p>the beggar, and we’ll never recover our </p><p>grub.” </p><p> “Oh, we ain’t goin’ close enough for that,</p><p>Casino!” put in Bassett. “We’ll stay here</p><p>at the water’s edge and wait while you scout </p><p>along the bank.” </p><p> As Tom spoke, he and Eric were per-</p><p>sistently following in spite of Casino’s ges- </p><p>tured refusals of their company. </p><p> Casino stopped and stared at them sus-</p><p>piciously. Then he wheeled and ran head- </p><p>long for the river. </p><p> “They’re wise!” lie yelled at his friends.</p><p>“Run, men, run!” </p><p> After him lurched his four comrades, and</p><p>after them pounded Sark and Bassett. </p><p>And as they rushed along they heard the </p><p>thud of other running feet down Dawson’s </p><p>river streets and along the Yukon bank </p><p>itself. </p><p> “Told you you’d rout out the whole city!</p><p>reproached Sark. “Your bellowing’s spread </p><p>the news.” </p><p> “Huh!” Tom grunted. “As if it wasn’t</p><p>spread before! Ever see a stampede every- </p><p>body wasn’t in on? If they’re not in at the </p><p>head they’re in at the tail and squeezin' up </p><p>the middle. Every man thinks he’s the only </p><p>one as knows. He snickers to himself that </p><p>he’s got a dead-sealed secret padlocked in </p><p>his lonely breast, but when it comes to the </p><p>lightin’-out poiut, they’s others at the same </p><p>stunt, swarms of ’em, jumpin’ out of the </p><p>grass like skeeters in Jooly. Jist look at the </p><p>roisterin’ riverbank thar and see if I'm </p><p>not right!” </p><p>SARK raised his eyes as he sprinted </p><p>and saw the shore ahead lined with </p><p>men pulling poling-boats off the </p><p>muck. Other men were already afloat, </p><p>moving like phantoms iu the haze as ihey </p><p>worked their crafts, while beyond these, </p><p>so far out as to be invisible, the creak of </p><p>oars and the splash of poles told of more </p><p>boats in the lead of the race. </p><p> “Halpune’s a pal of Gunboat’s, and he’s</p><p>put Gunboat wise, ain’t he?” chuckled Bas- </p><p>sett harshly. “O’ course, Gunboat thought </p><p>as he was the only man and that the news </p><p>wouldn’t circulate till momin’. But how </p><p>many did Halpune put wise before he grad- </p><p>uated Gunboat? Only a few dozen! That </p><p>ain’t many. Oh, no! Wonder if any of </p><p>’em’s confiscated our boat? Lucky, we are, </p><p>pardner. Here she is, all splattered and de- </p><p>filed with the mucky mukluks of Casino's </p><p>bunch clamberin’ out over her to launch </p><p>their own. Yes, that’s their boat, that last </p><p>one. It laid beside ours. But never mind, </p><p>we’ll jist beat ’em acrost for that. Shove </p><p>her out in their track.” </p><p> The groove where Casino’s craft had been</p><p>dragged out showed deep and oozy in the </p><p>mud. Sark and Bassett wiggled their own </p><p>boat over into it and launched off. It was </p><p>June high-water on the Yukon, and, swollen </p><p>with the Hoods of big tributaries such as the </p><p>Klondike, the Sixtymile, the Stewart, the </p><p>White and the Pelly, the river was running </p><p>strong. </p><p> Some of the leading boats couJd be heard</p><p>through the haze, speeding down with the </p><p>swift current towards fresno Creek, which </p><p>flowed into the Yukon some fourteen miles </p><p>below Dawson, but these were ones whose </p><p>early start assured them time enough to get </p><p>in on the creek by the water route. </p><p> The men in the later-launched boats had</p><p>no good chance of overtaking the leading </p><p>Stolen Thunder </p><p>121 </p><p>ones, and they apparently knew it. They </p><p>did not risk everything on the attempt. </p><p>They were heading across towards the west </p><p>bank of the Yukon where the trail from </p><p>Dawson City to Glacier Creek, up in the </p><p>Sixtymile country, began. </p><p> The route by land was shorter than the</p><p>route by water, and in case Fresno should </p><p>be staked well up to the head when they </p><p>arrived, they would not be compelled to </p><p>waste time traveling the whole creek length </p><p>before grabbing some ground. This was the </p><p>plan of the partners, and they could now see </p><p>that this was the plan of Casino also. </p><p> “Give up his dash down-stream!” com-</p><p>mented Bassett, staring after Casino’s craft </p><p>which was moving faster than theirs. “Seen </p><p>thar was too many ahead, and I'll be </p><p>bludgeoned if he ain’t goin’ to beat us acrost </p><p>at that! How’s he doin’ it, Eric?” </p><p> “Oars, I guess,” Sark enlightened. “Oars</p><p>as well as the poles. Our oars, too, Tom, if </p><p>anybody should float down the river and </p><p>ask vou! I left them in our boat this morn- </p><p>ing.” </p><p> “The sartorial skunk! That’s Casino</p><p>for you. If he hadn’t ’a’ had poles, even, </p><p>he’d ’a' apologetically appropriated ours, </p><p>and we could ’a’ paddled with our hands. </p><p>Look at Casino and Company puttin’ on </p><p>speed, hittin’ one hundred and thirty-six </p><p>or tharabouts to the minnit. But jist wait </p><p>till we thump the trail, Eric. We’ll show </p><p>’em what a combined cross-country hurdle </p><p>and obstacle race is. We’ll jerk Casino and </p><p>his crooked cronies along so fast that their </p><p>heels’ll be back on Quebec Creek when their </p><p>heads is up on Fresno. Go to it, pardner. </p><p>Tut a grouch into your pole!”</p><p> “I’m putting all I’ve got into it,” com-</p><p>plained Sark, “but this vessel poles like </p><p>Noah’s Ark. She’s waterlogged, Tom; </p><p>that's what makes her drive so hard. I’m </p><p>afraid we’ll have to be getting a new boat </p><p>this Spring.” </p><p> “Huh! New boat? What was she but a</p><p>new boat when I bought her off Durslane </p><p>in the Fall?” </p><p> “But she’s waterlogged all the same.</p><p>Youve got eyes, haven’t you? Bottom </p><p>must be punkv. The water’s nearly up to </p><p>my ankles here in the bow.” </p><p> Yes, and it's over my ankles here in the</p><p>stern. But T 11 swear the bottom was sound </p><p>when I bought her. Mebbe the sun opened </p><p>her seams some. Wait till I feel a bit!” </p><p> Tom stooped and plunged his arm up to</p><p>the elbow in the muddy water, scraping his </p><p>fingers over the boat’s bottom. </p><p> “Malice aforethought!” he exploded.</p><p>“Cuts, Eric, ax cuts and a belt-ax by the </p><p>size of ’em. Thar’s some more of Casino!'’ </p><p> “The beggar! Does he want to drown</p><p>us?” </p><p> “Oh, no danger of that! They’s just</p><p>dinky leetle chinks. Not enough to swamp </p><p>and destroy us, but jist enough to filter in a </p><p>half-ton of water while we’re crossin7 and </p><p>impede us like a boat-load of lead. </p><p> “The beggar, I say! We’ll move across</p><p>about as fast as a hearse." </p><p> “No we won’t either. Pole back, pard-</p><p>ner, and we’ll git another boat.” </p><p>THEY dug in their poles with all </p><p>their strength, brought the boat to a </p><p>stop and then drove it madly back </p><p>towards the east bank of the Yukon. The </p><p>river was a mile wide at this point. The </p><p>partners were only an eighth of a mile </p><p>out, and they were not long reaching the </p><p>shore. </p><p> They did not stop to pull up their craft</p><p>but leaped as soon as it struck the shallows. </p><p>The water splashed them to the waist, and </p><p>the mud threatened to mire them com- </p><p>pletely, yet other boats afloat or in the act </p><p>of getting afloat from the bank paid them </p><p>no attention. The minds of the owners took </p><p>cognizance of nothing but the stampede, so </p><p>Sark and Bassett floundered out unaided </p><p>and gained the muck-trampled shore. </p><p> “The pernicious parasite!” gritted Sark,</p><p>anathematizing Casino while he slapped </p><p>the water from his thighs. “He knew there </p><p>was no chance of his leading the land race </p><p>to Fresno if we were in at the start, so he </p><p>cut off our competition back of the ears and</p><p>left us cold at the post. We’ll never catch </p><p>him now, Tom.” </p><p> “Mebbe not,” doubted Bassett, squint-</p><p>ing wryly at the mist which hid the mile- </p><p>distant west bank, “but we’ll make a te- </p><p>nacious try for it. Stay here till I beg, </p><p>borrer or steal somethin’ that floats!” </p><p> Like a wallowing hippopotamus, Tom</p><p>ploughed down the muddy bank, casting </p><p>covetous eyes on many a craft whose owners </p><p>ominously warned him off, until finally he </p><p>ran into a Swede ’longshoreman disembark- </p><p>ing part of the cargo of a grounded river </p><p>steamer from a boat the size of a scow. </p><p> “Here, Ole, I want that boat,” Bassett</p><p>informed. “I’m goin’ acrost the Yukon. </p><p>I 22 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Twenty-five dollars is the hire. Hurry up, </p><p>throw out them boxes and bundles!” </p><p> The Swede ’longshoreman who had no</p><p>interest in stampedes gazed at him ox-like. </p><p> “Ay lank, Ay ban batter have fifty,” he</p><p>boosted. </p><p> “You usurer! But I’m the goat this trip.</p><p>I kin’t alTord to kick. Fifty it is, Ole. Git </p><p>a twist on. Eric, hey, hustle here! Help us </p><p>stevedore this stuff.” </p><p> Out into the mud the boxes and bundles</p><p>flew in a reckless deluge. The unwieldy </p><p>boat, the size of a scow, was warped around </p><p>and poked clear of the shallows. Its long </p><p>sweeps came into play, and after fifteen </p><p>minutes of straining and heaving on the </p><p>part of all three men, the craft reached the </p><p>farther ?.hore. It rode in on the whirl of an </p><p>eddy, swung around, stove two small be- </p><p>lated poling-boats just about to land, stuck </p><p>its nose fast in the bank and spilled Sark </p><p>and Bassett ashore over its bow. </p><p> “I dunno how you’ll ever git back, Ole,</p><p>with this flood runnin’,” was Tom’s fare- </p><p>well. “But if you kin’t, why, tail in on the </p><p>stampede. Yon cargo’ll keep all right.” </p><p>THEIR mishap had lost the part- </p><p>ners a great deal of time. The main </p><p>rush was miles ahead of them. </p><p>Only the stragglers were here at the rear. </p><p>But their feet once upon the well-known </p><p>Glacier Creek trail, Tom and Eric pro- </p><p>ceeded to make up lost time. In the first </p><p>two miles they caught and passed a do^en of </p><p>these stragglers as if they were standing </p><p>still. Alter that the partners ran practically </p><p>alone, and up to the end of the first hour </p><p>when they crossed the headwaters of Que- </p><p>bec Creek they saw no more stampedcrs. </p><p> “Casino’s certainly hikin’ ’em along,” ob-</p><p>served Bassett, as he and Sark paused a few </p><p>moments at Quebec Creek to breathe them- </p><p>selves. “The bunch is runnin’ mighty com- </p><p>pact, or we’d ’a’ caught a dozen or so of ’em. </p><p>He knows we’re in no ways what you’d call </p><p>quitters, so he’s takin’ no chances. He’s </p><p>hittin’ only the high spots and never lookin’ </p><p>’round.” </p><p> “That's just what we’ve got to do, too,”</p><p>puffed Sark. “We’ve covered the first </p><p>seventy-five yards of your hundred-yard </p><p>sprint,’Tom. The home stretch of the last </p><p>twenty-five yards is ahead of us now. You </p><p>got your second wind?” </p><p> “Sure! And I’m keepin’ my third in my</p><p>pocket. Go ahead. If we don’t tag some- </p><p>body soon, I'll hang up my racin’ mukluks </p><p>and leave the Klondike trails alone.” </p><p> Fresh from their brief rest, they dashed</p><p>on through the ckmk Spring air. The </p><p>Glacier Creek trail roughly followed the low </p><p>di\ ide l&gt;ing between Swede Creek and the </p><p>\ ukon River. Valleys flooded with hill </p><p>water stretched away on either hand. </p><p>Wedges of wild fowl drove over the watery </p><p>wastes. Flowers, new-sprung from the </p><p>snows, raised their blossoms by the trail- </p><p>side, and animal life scurried in the under- </p><p>brush, but these attributes of Spring did </p><p>not smite on the consciousness of the men. </p><p>Their minds were focused on Fresno. </p><p> They sped viciously, blindly, reeking in a</p><p>sweat bath, flinging ridge and valley, bluff </p><p>and gulch, scrub timber and niggerhead </p><p>swamp behind. They p&gt;assed the dwindling </p><p>upper reaches of another small stream be- </p><p>yond Quebec Creek, and a couple of miles </p><p>beyond that struck the extreme tip of </p><p>Fresno. </p><p> Now the -wisdom of following the land</p><p>route became apparent, for Fresno Creek, </p><p>although its main trend was almosl due </p><p>■west, curved south before reaching the </p><p>Glacier Creek trail, paralleled it for some </p><p>distance and met it half-way back to Que- </p><p>bec Creek. It was as if while the stampede </p><p>was racing for the creek, the creek was </p><p>twisting back to meet the stampede. </p><p>■ AS THEY plunged down the Fresno </p><p>bench-ground at a jarring run, the </p><p>partners felt the disappointed </p><p>qualms of the stampeder who arrives too </p><p>late. Here there was little mist. Fires </p><p>blazed down all the length of the valley, and </p><p>fires at the head meant that the creek was </p><p>located from the mouth up. In the creek </p><p>itself poling-boats splashed along, and </p><p>clamor dinned out on the shores.</p><p> “Staked to the pearly sky-line. Eric!”</p><p>groaned Bassett lugubriously. “Thar's </p><p>the highest claim right below us. Casino, </p><p>the whelp, put us outa Uie runnin’ with so </p><p>simple a tool as a belt-ax.” </p><p> “Yes, and when I find him, Tom, I’ll take</p><p>his belt-ax out of his belt and sink it in his </p><p>perverted scalp,” Sark threatened. </p><p> “You’ll have some hunt then. He’s</p><p>likely staked down about the mouth, and </p><p>he’ll be back in Dawson recordin’ before </p><p>you git to him. But what's wTong with that </p><p>geezer below us? What’s he punchin the </p><p>atmosphere full of holes for?” </p><p>Stolen Thunder </p><p>123 </p><p> “Driving his stakes, isn’t he?”</p><p> ‘‘No. By thunder, he’s wavin’ on us!</p><p>That means open ground yet. Quick! </p><p>Buck-jump it, pardner, or we’ll lose out. </p><p>Some galoot’ll roll over the ridge and beat </p><p>us to it.” </p><p> In ten-foot leaps the pair bounded</p><p>down the hillside on to the creek claim of the </p><p>man who was beckoning them. </p><p> “Casino!” barked Sark, glaring at the</p><p>man’s face revealed by the fire’s glow. </p><p> “Sure! I was scared you wouldn’t see or</p><p>hear me and go past. There’s a thousand </p><p>feet left above me. Kick in sudden, boys. </p><p>It’s the last.” </p><p> “God bless you, Casino!” sighed Sark.</p><p>“You benign, repentant beggar. I forgive </p><p>you, belt-ax and all.” </p><p> “Oh, you didn’t need to worry yourselves</p><p>hoary-headed over that little stunt!” grinned </p><p>Casino. “I heard a duffer say once at the </p><p>Omar Opery in Dawson that all was fair in </p><p>love and war. I can go him one better and </p><p>add stampedes. I knew you two had the </p><p>grit and gumption to lead the land race if </p><p>1 let you. So I didn’t let you. Savvy? </p><p>But poverizin’ little good it did me, after all. </p><p>You see where I’m planted!” </p><p> “What happened to you?” asked Tom.</p><p>“ Why ain’t you staked away down-creek?” </p><p> “You know that northerly feeder of</p><p>Quebec Creek? Well, what did we do in the </p><p>mist but take it for a pup of Fresno and go </p><p>pikin* down her! Lost four miles before we </p><p>plumped on to our mistake and cut across </p><p>the ridges. Lost four miles and the chance </p><p>to stake next Discovery! But there’s no </p><p>use lamentin'. Me and my friends are </p><p>lucky to get in at all, and you’re just as </p><p>lucky. Ante, Gunboat, Slim and Alabama </p><p>are below me, and you’d belter whack in. </p><p>Excuse me for not helpin’ you, boys, but I</p><p>can t move off my claim till you get staked, </p><p>for fear some one jumps it.”' </p><p> “What’s your number there?” asked Bas-</p><p>sett. </p><p>k “Twenty-Three Above, it’s supposed to </p><p> “It’s Halpune’s strike, ain’t it?”</p><p> four-dollar pans! But mebbe</p><p>that s hot air. </p><p> “Where’d Halpune stake?” demanded</p><p>Casmo’smn8 5 “ thc ground next </p><p> ‘ .About half way down. The claims run</p><p>to Twenty-Four Below at Fresno’s mouth, </p><p>1 near, bo you boys must sure be pretty- </p><p>plumb on the truth when you count yours </p><p>Twenty-Four and Twenty-Five Above. </p><p>Good luck to you, boys, and glad you got </p><p>in, even if I did take a swipe at you on the </p><p>way. That’s all in the game. Mebbe next </p><p>stampede there is I’ll be the one to get a </p><p>jolt from you.” </p><p> LAUGHING in friendly fashion,</p><p>Casino, now that his uppermost </p><p>boundary bordering on Sark’s lower </p><p>one was safe, strode down through the </p><p>scrub on his claim to hold communication </p><p>with Ante and Gunboat below him and </p><p>gather the latest news. Sark went on with </p><p>his staking, pacing off five hundred feet, </p><p>which gave the location of his upper stakes </p><p>and Bassett’s lower ones. </p><p> “Not such a greedy gink arter all," com-</p><p>mented Tom, as they whittled smooth the </p><p>faces of their corner stakes to receive the </p><p>numbers. “He might ’a’ tried to blanket </p><p>these two claims. Wonder if the creek'll </p><p>run rich. Eric?” </p><p> “I hardly think it,” calculated Sark, “and</p><p>I’m not banking on it. In the first place I </p><p>don’t for a minute believe that four-dollar </p><p>pan guff. That’s always the cry. Twenty- </p><p>five cent pans grow into four- and five-dollar </p><p>pans mighty quick when there’s a rush on. </p><p> “I don’t see Halpune swaggering ’round</p><p>anywhere. He’s a gambler like Casino, and </p><p>if he’d have struck it that big, he’d be </p><p>snooping around, up-creek and down, buy- </p><p>ing all the cheap claims he could get his </p><p>claws on. And in the second place, if the </p><p>creek shows up anything in placer. I'll take </p><p>my oath it’ll prove patchy. Fact is, part- </p><p>ner, Fresno never did look to me like a </p><p>placer proposition. What’s more, it looks </p><p>to me just like what it always did. It looks </p><p>like a quartz proposition. Just cast your </p><p>eye over that ridge back of us, Tom, and </p><p>see if it doesn’t.” </p><p> “By thunder, you're right. Eric!” ex-</p><p>claimed Bassett, running a speculative eye</p><p>over the broken, ragged contour of the </p><p>ridge. “That's quartz formation sure. The </p><p>fiamelight shows the outcrops. Mebbe </p><p>we’ve had all our sprintin’ for nothin’.” </p><p>“Don’t know, Tom, but we’ll soon see. </p><p>You ’tend to your corner stake, and we ll </p><p>sink a hole on the common line of the two </p><p>claims and prove them up together. It </p><p>shouldn’t take long. By the dip of the </p><p>creek bank it’s shallow bedrock here. I </p><p>know Fresno. I’ve prospected it before. </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Bedrock’s not very deep any place, and just </p><p>where I stand I'll bet it’s not over ten or </p><p>twelve feet down. You go and finish your </p><p>staking and then come and help me scrape.” </p><p>THE Spring rains and Hoods had </p><p>left the ground soft and mucky. </p><p>Sark found little difficulty in sink- </p><p>ing a prospect hole with a rude wooden </p><p>shovel carved out of a willow slab with his </p><p>hunting-kriife. When he was down three </p><p>feet Bassett came back from the staking </p><p>and aided him by digging with a long pole </p><p>used like a crowbar. They wenc down </p><p>another three feet, and Eric’s wooden </p><p>shovel gritted into gravel. </p><p> “Got it?” asked Tom.</p><p> “Yes, I knew it was shallow bed-rock.</p><p>There must be a fine thick pay-streak here- </p><p>abouts, that is, if there is any pay in it.” </p><p>“We'll possess that knowledge in a min- </p><p>nit, pardner. We ain’t got any pan to sam- </p><p>ple, but here, fill my hat.” </p><p> Tom handed down to Sark a nice, new</p><p>Stetson, with which he had adorned him- </p><p>self at the coming of Spring, and Eric with- </p><p>out qualm or scruple loaded it up with </p><p>handfuls of the dirty gravel. He shoved the </p><p>hat up to Tom and clambered out after it, </p><p>his face and clothes plastered with the </p><p>sticky overburden. Together they went </p><p>down to the creek edge. Eric twisted a </p><p>few dried willow branches into a heap and </p><p>touched a match to them for a better light </p><p>than the semi-luminous Yukon night af- </p><p>forded, while Bassett dipped the hat care- </p><p>fully into the shore ripples of the stream. </p><p> With a slow, circular motion Tom washed</p><p>out the light muck so that it floated away, </p><p>discoloring more deeply the already mired </p><p>creek water. By degrees he wore down the </p><p>hatful—the new Stetson bravely upholding </p><p>its reputation as waterproof—until he had </p><p>only the desired residue left. Then with a </p><p>twist of the wrist he flirted the remaining </p><p>water out and showed up a smattering of </p><p>black sand speckled with shining yellow</p><p>grains across the bottom of the hat. </p><p> “Thunderation—pay!” ejaculated Sark,</p><p>as the firelight gleamed on the yellow </p><p>grains. “Rich pay, Tom!” </p><p> “Sure,” nodded Bassett, scraping to-</p><p>gether the little heap of golden particles. </p><p>‘'Two dollars, Eric, if they’s a speck. A </p><p>two-dollar pan, bonafide and indisputable. </p><p>We’ve got it arter all our doubtin’.” </p><p> “And 1 lose, Tom. My judgment’s poor.</p><p>It’s something more than a quart2 proposi- </p><p>tion. Wonder if Halpune’s sample ran as </p><p>high?” </p><p> “It certainly didn't, or he’d ’a’ bin out</p><p>buyin’. That's our game, Eric. We got a </p><p>foundation to go on. and we sure gutta clean </p><p>up the creek. My claim’s Twenty-Five </p><p>Above. Casino says the string runs to </p><p>Twenty-Four Below at the mouth. That, </p><p>with Discovery, is fifty claims altogether. </p><p>We own two already. We’ll buy the hull re- </p><p>mainin' forty-eight and make twenty-five </p><p>million dollars in one night.” </p><p> “But remember it hasn’t changed its</p><p>looks; it still looks quartzy,” reminded </p><p>Sark, liis innate caution getting the better </p><p>of liis enthusiasm. “And even if it is all </p><p>placer, it might prove patch}r.” </p><p> ‘Tah! Things ain’t very patchy whar</p><p>two-dollar pans is panned first crack. </p><p>Even if it should be, it’ll average up. Look </p><p>at our two claims! Worth half a million </p><p>dollars apiece if they’re worth an ounce. </p><p>The other’ll average up to that ligger on the </p><p>basis of this. hat. If some slump under, </p><p>others’ll produce over. </p><p> “Twenty-five million dollars, Eric, is the</p><p>value of this valley, and we kin buy it for a </p><p>hundred thousand. Don’t the opportunity </p><p>smite you blind and give you a gone feelin’ </p><p>in the pit of your stomach? It does me. </p><p>But we gotta shake our nerves together and </p><p>act abrupt or prices’ll go up. I hear Ca- </p><p>sino and his friends talkin' down yonder </p><p>now. He’s cornin’ back. He mustn't come </p><p>on our claim. We must meet him on his </p><p>own ground. Shuffle yourself and help me </p><p>dump the muck back into the prospeck </p><p>hole.” </p><p>BASSETT crammed his wet Stet- </p><p>son, still containing the gold sam- </p><p>ple, out of sight into liis pocket, </p><p>kicked the willow smudge into the creek </p><p>and ran with Sark to the hole. Hastily they </p><p>shoveled back the overburden, tramped it </p><p>smoothly down and hurried along the creek </p><p>limits to meet Casino crossing the boun- </p><p>dary of liis and Ante’s claim.</p><p> “Finish stakin’, boys?" Casino greeted.</p><p>“Yes, all plumb, lines and stakes in plain </p><p>sight,” Bassett told him. “And we also </p><p>panned a sample.” </p><p> “Haw! Haw!” laughed Casino. “That s</p><p>a good one. How’dyouget to bed-rock so </p><p>sudden? Dive?” </p><p> “We also panned a sample,” repeated</p><p>Stolen Thunder </p><p>125 </p><p>Bassett imperturbably. “I come out flat- </p><p>footed and tell you so, Casino. But mind, </p><p>I’m not tellin’ you what kind of sample, </p><p>good or bad. We sampled. Thar’s the </p><p>point. So don’t you say in the days to come </p><p>that we made a secret prospeck and acted </p><p>underhand without due diffusion of our </p><p>knowledge. We sampled, I say, and we’re </p><p>out to buy.” </p><p> •‘Then take care you don’t get stung,”</p><p>cautioned Casino promptly. “I just found </p><p>out somethin’. Ante tells me the word’s </p><p>come up that Halpune’s four-dollar pans </p><p>contained twenty cents. What do you know </p><p>about that? I think we’re in bad, boys. </p><p>I wish I’d never started on this stampede. </p><p>I’ve blunted my belt-ax on your boat- </p><p>bottom and jiggled my heart down into my </p><p>stomach all for nothin'.” </p><p> “Jist the same, since Eric and me’s here,</p><p>we’re takin’ a gambler’s chance,” Tom an- </p><p>nounced. 1‘We’re goin’ to buy some claims, </p><p>in fact every claim that’s for sale. Your </p><p>claim for sale, Casino?” </p><p> “Sure, if you want it bad, but don’t you</p><p>make a bluff with me about the creek bein’ </p><p>worth while. I’ve seen you at the gam- </p><p>blin’ game before. I’ve seen you buy whole </p><p>creeks that you never sampled at all, doz- </p><p>ens of them, and I’d make a blatant bet </p><p>that you never squared yourselves on any </p><p>one of them. You haven’t had time to sam- </p><p>ple anyway. And where are your shovels? </p><p>You sure didn’t get a chance to bring them </p><p>with you-. What did you dig your prospect </p><p>hole with—your hands? What did you </p><p>pan your sample with—your boot? B’ah! </p><p>You can’t bamboozle me. You hadn’t a </p><p>tarnation tool with you. Why, Tom, you </p><p>haven’t even a hat!” </p><p> “Never mind that, Casino. What’s your</p><p>claim worth?” </p><p> •‘Well, my friends down there, Ante, Gun-</p><p>boat Slim and Alabama, just said haphaz- </p><p>ard that it nught be worth fifteen hundred </p><p>dollars as a suburban lot. Mighty scornful </p><p>they were of its resident propensities ” </p><p>B^ y°u ^elve hundred,” offered</p><p> “Then I’ll take two thousand,” grinned</p><p>Cas.no cunningly. “Mebbe vou fellows </p><p>know more n I think. So I’ll just play safe. </p><p>You can have it as I state without me </p><p>nCtr	,n n’ Two thousand dollars</p><p>r&gt; Casino stuck to his figure despite </p><p>Bassett s haggling until Tom, handicapped </p><p>by the necessity of quick action, had to </p><p>yield. </p><p> “Ail right, two thousand it is, but Gun-</p><p>boat, Ante, Alabama and Slim has all got to </p><p>sell at the same price,” stipulated Tom. </p><p>“They don’t boost me no more.” </p><p> “Oh, tw’o thousand’ll tickle them most</p><p>crazy!” smiled Casino. “I know' that by </p><p>their remarks about suburban properties. </p><p>The)" ain’t much for the simple life, those </p><p>guys. I’ll just hail Ante to summon them </p><p>all up.” </p><p> INSIDE of twenty minutes Sark</p><p>and Bassett had bought the five </p><p>claims, and the bills of sale were </p><p>made over. These bills of sale had a mone- </p><p>tary as well as a documentary value and, </p><p>though scribbled with pencil on scraps of </p><p>paper, each was sound as a bond and good </p><p>for two thousand dollars in Dawson City. </p><p> Using this same class of currency, the</p><p>partners then w’ent down the creek on the </p><p>same mission. The sale of claims Twenty- </p><p>Three, Twenty-Two, Twenty'-One, Twenty </p><p>and Nineteen Above hastened the sale of </p><p>the others. It set the pace and the price. </p><p>By morning the partners had purchased </p><p>everything in sight, clear to Fresno's </p><p>mouth. </p><p> Halpune was the only man who succeeded</p><p>in holding them up, but the fact that he </p><p>finally sold Discovery', a thousand foot </p><p>claim, and One Below Discover,-, which as </p><p>the discoverer he was privileged by law to </p><p>locate, for five thousand dollars each, showed </p><p>Tom and Eric how inflated was the four- </p><p>dollar pan report. Nevertheless their own </p><p>two-dollar pan loomed large on their finan- </p><p>cial horizon, and they chetjfully paid. </p><p> “Nowy’ gloated Tom at daw'n, “we own</p><p>the creek. Twenty-five million dollars it's </p><p>w'orth, and it cost us only one hundred and </p><p>two thousand dollars. You're the hardiest </p><p>member of the firm, Eric, and it’s up to you </p><p>to go to Daw'son and record. You kin </p><p>borrer a boat from some of the vendors and </p><p>go up the \ ukon. I'll borrc-r another and </p><p>row back to our claims. I’m tired walkin’. </p><p>And thar 1 11 steal an hour’s sleep, hire a </p><p>hand and git through that pay-streak while </p><p>you re gone. We'll know how thick it is</p><p>w'hen you come back. You’d better bring </p><p>Tagish Jim and a dozen or a dozen and a </p><p>half of the Chilcats with you to prove up </p><p>the rest of the holdin’s. Things’ll sure </p><p>assume gigantic proportions here, and we’U </p><p>126 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>need that many at the start. Whether we’ll </p><p>need more remains to be seen." </p><p> That evening at the hour of dark, al-</p><p>though since the endless day was now on the </p><p>Yukon there was no real dark, Eric Sark </p><p>poled back up the Fresno on his return trip </p><p>from Dawson. In his poling-boat, working </p><p>with him, was the Chilcat foreman, Tagish </p><p>JLm, and behind in more poling-boats were </p><p>sixteen more Chit cats, sun-smoked, huge- </p><p>muscled men, giants of the open, fit engines </p><p>of toil to tear up the stubborn creek limits </p><p>and wrest from the golden gravels Bassett’s </p><p>twenty-five million dollars. </p><p> The boats were beached on Twenty-Four</p><p>and iwenty-Five Above. The Chilcats </p><p>leaped swiftly out and began to kindle a </p><p>long, oval tire in the fashion they had </p><p>learned of white men whereon to cook their </p><p>evening meal. Sark looked around for his </p><p>partner and discovered him smoking quietly </p><p>on the edge of the prospect hole which was </p><p>now enlarged to the proportions of a shaft. </p><p> “What depth’s bed-rock, Tom?” was his</p><p>first anxious question. </p><p> “Twelve feet,” Basset answered.</p><p>“Pay-streak’s slx feet thick, then? How’s </p><p>it panning now?” </p><p> “Jist the same.”</p><p> “Fine! Glad to hear that, partner. I</p><p>been a little worried, you know. I made </p><p>something of a discovery in Dawson, a dis- </p><p>covery I didn’t somehow like, Tom!” </p><p> Bassett twisted around on the edge of the</p><p>shaft, took his pipe from his lips and gazed </p><p>fixedly at Sark. </p><p> “What was it?” he demanded.</p><p> “You remember what we heard through</p><p>the crack in the wall in the Northern Light? </p><p>We heard Gunboat tell the rest that Hal- </p><p>pune had recorded just as the recording- </p><p>office closed. Today’s the twelfth. That </p><p>was yesterday, the eleventh. Well, the </p><p>mining records don’t say so. I looked when </p><p>I recorded what we bought, and when I </p><p>came to get the transfer of Halpune’s, I </p><p>found he had recorded his Discovery and </p><p>One Below Discovery on the tenth.” </p><p> “He did, eh?” mused Bassett. “Then</p><p>that fits in with a discovery I've made my- </p><p>self. I’ve found out, Eric, that the date on</p><p>the location notices on every claim we’ve </p><p>bought is June the tenth.” </p><p> “Tarnation, Tom! I was suspicious as</p><p>soon as I saw it. Only I thought there </p><p>might have been some mistake. But the </p><p>date of Halpune’s recording and the date </p><p>on the notices sure can’t both be mistakes. </p><p>There’s only one thing that can mean." </p><p> “Only one thing, pardner. Them claims</p><p>was all measured out and staked the day </p><p>before the stampede started. Casino’s the </p><p>man as did it. You didn't notice anythin’ </p><p>pecooliar about the names of the claim </p><p>owners did you, when you was giltin’ things </p><p>fixed up?” </p><p> “I noticed that they were all Casino’s</p><p>close friends, every hard-bitten beggar of </p><p>them. That struck me as rather funny, </p><p>too.” </p><p> “It was part of the plan, Eric. Casino’s</p><p>worked a colossal come-on, and we fell for </p><p>it. 1II tell you of another discovery I made </p><p>while you was gone. I discovered that the </p><p>claims we staked was salted. Salted on the </p><p>boundary' line jist whar two pardner.' .vouid </p><p>nacherally sink their prospeck hole.” </p><p>“Salted, Tom? But there you’re wrong. </p><p>There you sure touch my pride. No man </p><p>can sell me ground that’s been dug before </p><p>without me knowing it. J.’ll take my altar </p><p>oath that nobody had put shovel into the </p><p>muck of that prospect hole before mine. </p><p>I’m always on my guard against that trick. </p><p>The stuff we panned was there by nature. ’ </p><p>“No, it wasn’t, neither. It was planted.” </p><p>“But wouldn’t somebody have to dig to </p><p>plant it?” </p><p> “Nope, they tunneled from the river.”</p><p>“Yes, and it full of water! I guess not!” </p><p>“They tunneled before thar was any </p><p>water,” Bassett calmly explained. “Tun- </p><p>neled when it was frozen. Now do you </p><p>savvy? The pav-streak we struck wasn't no </p><p>pay-streak at all. It was gravel shoveled </p><p>in thar and sowed with a few ounces of </p><p>Fortymile or Sixtymile or Stewart River </p><p>gold. I’ve got it all in my pocket, and I </p><p>know whereof 1 speak. But if you’re any- </p><p>wav doubtful, come and have a look at the </p><p>shaft.” </p><p>BASSETT plucked a burning stick </p><p>from the Chilcats’ fire for a torch </p><p>and lighted the way. He thrust the </p><p>torch into the open shaft whose black </p><p>mouth yawned with a twelve-foot yawn, </p><p>and Eric climbed down on the rude pole </p><p>ladder, made of a small tree trunk with </p><p>many limb crotches, to look. At tin level</p><p>of his head he saw what was beyond denial </p><p>the old workings of a tunnel driven in from </p><p>the Fresno’s bed. The fact that it was so </p><p>low down suggested that it had been driven </p><p>Stolen Thunder </p><p>127 </p><p>in time of frost, and the settling of the oozing </p><p>earth, leaving a gap at the tunnel roof, sup- </p><p>plied the proof. </p><p> “It sure was a pippin of a plan, Tom,”</p><p>admired Eric, climbing out again, “and a </p><p>well-matured pippin at that.” </p><p> “Yep,” agreed Bassett, “so ripe it was</p><p>rotten to the core. Casino’s some con- </p><p>scientious artist, eh? Jist made one slip. </p><p>Forgot to date the location notices one day </p><p>ahead. You see, he must ’a’ prepared </p><p>this salt not long before the ice-run and </p><p>cooked up the stampede to suit. His </p><p>game’s a lot like checkers, pardner. When </p><p>the play’s through, you kin look back and </p><p>see the moves you didn’t see before. </p><p> “Casino chose his ground, chose the</p><p>man to make the strike and chose the </p><p>members to compose the rush. Then he </p><p>had Halpune record, and watched for a </p><p>chance to spring the discovery stuff on us. </p><p>If the chance hadn’t ’a’ come in the North- </p><p>ern Light, it would ’a’ come in the Moose- </p><p>horn or the Polaris, or down by some </p><p>bushes on the river bank or out behind a </p><p>bale of goods on the steamer landin’, jist </p><p>wherever we happened to be and oppor- </p><p>tunities looked good. But the wherever </p><p>turned out to be the Northern Light. </p><p> “Casino knowed blame well whar we</p><p>was loungin’, and he knowed blame well we </p><p>could hear and see through that crack. </p><p>Hence the tableau they put on. But it was </p><p>well acted, Eric, we got to admit that. It </p><p>makes me laugh when I think of it. It was </p><p>thunderin’ well acted.” </p><p> “Oh yes, Tom, and so was the collision</p><p>stunt in the street and the waterlogged boat </p><p>on the \ ukon River! There were no black- </p><p>flies on that.” </p><p> ^No sir, it was all in the program, a</p><p>comedy in four acts and I dunno how many </p><p>scenes. All arranged, even to the two last </p><p>claims saved for us!” </p><p> Alightn t Casino have got slipped up</p><p>there. Mightn’t a couple of outsiders—for </p><p>you know there were outsiders vainly tail- </p><p>mg m on the stampede—have pounced on </p><p>that ground?” </p><p> “Don’t you ever dream it, pardner. No</p><p>outsider could V got that. Casino and his </p><p>tour pals next him would ’a’ shifted the</p><p>stakes of the five claims so as to blanket that </p><p>one thousand feet and reserve it till we </p><p>showed up. Thar’s no use prevaricatin’ or </p><p>equivocatm’ about it to ourselves. We was </p><p>the ones destined to buy, and we bravely </p><p>bought. My respeck for that geezer Ca- </p><p>sino’s increasin’ every day, Eric. He’s </p><p>raore’n a conscientious artist. He’s a deep </p><p>student of human nature. He was aware </p><p>of our frailties and our love of lucre. He </p><p>knowed as sure as the Y'ukon Summer's </p><p>back agin that we’d buy the creek if we </p><p>struck any kind of showin’. He seen us do </p><p>it many a time, and he knowed we’d do it </p><p>once too often.” </p><p> “Well, we’ve gone and done it once too</p><p>often,” chuckled Sark mirthlessly. “And </p><p>Casino’s pocketed the money. Wonder </p><p>what he paid each man to run in the salted </p><p>stampede?” </p><p> “Twenty-five dollars and the fun of it,”</p><p>hazarded Tom. “Mebbe fifty dollars at </p><p>the outside.” </p><p> “Call it fifty, then. That would be forty-</p><p>six men to pay, not counting himself. </p><p>Twenty-three hundred dollars to pay out, </p><p>and he got one hundred and two thousand </p><p>in. He’s made a haul of only ninety-nine </p><p>thousand, seven hundred dollars. That’s </p><p>not much, Tom.” </p><p> “Not much, Eric. .And we ain’t paid</p><p>much for them suburban lots. Only the </p><p>said one hundred and two thousand. That’s </p><p>not what you’d call prodigal. It’s only </p><p>moderate. But listen! The play ain’t </p><p>completed. The checkers is done, all right, </p><p>and we’ve lost our last king, but the check- </p><p>erboard’s one as you turn over to play a </p><p>different game on the other side. It’s our </p><p>throw now. Come back with me on to this </p><p>precipitous ridge behind our claims. I’ve </p><p>still got another discover}-1 ain’t uncovered </p><p>yet. I wanta show it to you.” </p><p> TOM stamped out the torch and</p><p>"strode off through the hall-gloom. </p><p>Sark followed him over ragged tim- </p><p>ber growth and rough boulders up on to the </p><p>steep of the hill. There Bassett paused, </p><p>scanning the top of the ridge and feeling </p><p>with his fingers for one of the prominent </p><p>outcrops w’hich they both had noticed the </p><p>night before from the creek limits. He </p><p>found the place he sought, kicked some dirt </p><p>awray and flashed the flame of a sulphur </p><p>match upon the rock face. </p><p> “Look!’’ he urged. “You vowed the</p><p>creek seemed quartz)*. What do you thinka </p><p>that?”</p><p> Sark stared through the brief flame-flare,</p><p>and his eyes strained and became fixed. In </p><p>the circle of faint illumination there showed </p><p>128 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>a wide quartz vein, three feet across, its </p><p>seams plastered with gleaming gold. </p><p> “By the spooks of the sundowns!” gasped</p><p>Sark, his breath catching in his throat with </p><p>a sharp click. “That’s a ledge to Live and </p><p>die on. Tom. Have you staked her?” </p><p> “No. I waited till you come with the</p><p>Chilcats. I ain’t no man to move contrary </p><p>to the law. You and me had already staked </p><p>claims on this creek. What kind-a claims </p><p>nobody could say if the matter popped up </p><p>for jurisdiction. Because the hull thing </p><p>was a salt, you see. W'e couldn’t prove </p><p>placer or pay-streak. And you sure kin’t </p><p>stake twice on the same creek. So if our </p><p>Twenty-Four and Twenty-Five Above hap- </p><p>pened to be rooled on as quartz, our stakin’ </p><p>on this ledge would be void, and we’d lose </p><p>the hull thing. </p><p> “Casino and the rest of his bunch is in the</p><p>same box. They’re celebratin’ at his camp </p><p>over thar and dunno anythin' about it, but </p><p>they soon will know. Then you’ll see don- </p><p>ned sackcloth and ashes, hear lamentation </p><p>and gnashin’ of teeth and mebbe stop a few </p><p>throwed stones with your ribs, Eric. They </p><p>won’t like it a leetle bit when they see the </p><p>Chilcats occupyin’ ground on our behalf.” </p><p>“Don’t let the beggars know it’s done at </p><p>alii I wouldn’t, if I’d made the discovery. </p><p>Casino’s been so sufferin’ smart. Just </p><p>have Tagish Jim and the rest sneak along </p><p>the ridge and locate these on the side.” </p><p>“Kin’t be done, partner,” Tom pointed </p><p>out. “It’s too light. Thars no dark at </p><p>night now. It’s only twilight, and a mighty </p><p>radiant twilight at that, jist like a dawn </p><p>that’s goin’ to break all the time but never </p><p>quite pulls it off. You kin see birds on that </p><p>ndge from Casino’s camp, and Casino cer- </p><p>tainly won’t miss spottin' them six-foot </p><p>Chilcats. He ain’t no ways short-sighted.” </p><p>“You want to kind of rub it into him, eh </p><p>-Tom?" </p><p> “That’s what I want to do. Rub it in</p><p>with sandpaper and turpentine for an </p><p>astringent. He’ll git a touch of his own </p><p>liniment, and we’ll see how he likes it. </p><p>Come on back to the fire, and I’ll put Tagish </p><p>Jim wise concernin’ what he’s to do.” </p><p> As Tom came up and beckoned, Tagish</p><p>Jim arose from his men about the oval of </p><p>red coals.</p><p> “What um want now?” he grinned.</p><p>“Quartz claims, Tagish,” Bassett ex- </p><p>plained tersely. “That ridge. You savvy? </p><p>Send the men to stake from the mouth of </p><p>Fresno up. The lower ones kin go in boats. </p><p>The middle ones kin run down. The upper </p><p>ones kin walk. I want 'em all to stake at </p><p>one time, within about an hour, and git </p><p>back here as soon as they stake. You stake </p><p>the last claim, here at the head, yourself. </p><p>Git me?” </p><p> “Get all right,” grunted Tagish, his eyes</p><p>lighting at the chance of some action'so </p><p>soon. “Want um claims measured well?” </p><p> “Yours, 1 do. The rest’ll do roughed out.</p><p>fifteen hundred feet square. Five hundred </p><p>steps. The seventeen of you’ll fill the </p><p>string. Eric and me grubstake you. Sawy? </p><p>You stake for us. Now start ’em out, </p><p>quick.” </p><p>TAGISH JIM moved silently to the </p><p>fire, explained to his men what was </p><p>required of them and told them off to </p><p>row, run or walk. The ones who would </p><p>stake half way down at once trotted across </p><p>the creek limits. Sark helped those who </p><p>were to go down to the mouth of Fresno </p><p>push off their boats and drift away. Then </p><p>he followed the remainder who, with Bas- </p><p>sett at their head giving further directions </p><p>to Tagish Jim, were climbing the ridge. </p><p> “Tagish, you go ahead and stake this,”</p><p>directed Tom, when they reached the top. </p><p>“Eric and me dassen’t put a finger in it. </p><p>We have staked somethin' down thar. W'e </p><p>dunno whether it’s a quartz claim, placer </p><p>claim or dredgin’ limit, but we re Iaw- </p><p>abidin’ men, and we live up to the letter of </p><p>the minin’ regulations. You’re runnin' the </p><p>hull show, and if anybody happens along jist </p><p>tell ’em so. That ground under your feet </p><p>is worth twelve thousand dollars if its worth </p><p>a disfigured cent. You kin drive your Dis- </p><p>covery stake right thar whar that out- </p><p>crop is.” </p><p> Methodically Tagish Jim went about the</p><p>business. First of all he drove his Dis- </p><p>covery stake at the spot Bassett indicated. </p><p>Then he paced off seven hundred and fifty </p><p>feet along the ledge on each side of the Dis- </p><p>covery post and at these points drove posts </p><p>numbers one and two. </p><p> At right angles to the line between posts</p><p>one and two and beginning at the posts </p><p>themselves, he paced the distance to the </p><p>boundary of the already staked claims on </p><p>the creek limits. This distance was not </p><p>great, because the limits commenced to</p><p>slope almost from the Fresno’s brink with a </p><p>sharp incline to strike the ridge which </p><p>Stolen Thunder </p><p>129 </p><p>formed the bench ground. It was only one </p><p>hundred and eighty feet. The rest of the </p><p>quartz claim lay upon the other side of the </p><p>location line. But there was no need to </p><p>pace that. It was a simple matter of sub- </p><p>traction. So Tagish w-ent back and w'ith a </p><p>stub of a pcncil scrawled the inscriptions on </p><p>his stakes. </p><p> The inscription upon the first post he had</p><p>driven read: </p><p>DISCOVERY FOST </p><p> That upon number one and two posts</p><p>was: </p><p>Quartz Claim—Tagish Jim—June 12th </p><p>1320—180 </p><p> The figures 1320 represented the number</p><p>of feet lying to the left of the location line, </p><p>the figures 1S0 the number lying to the </p><p>right. Thus, although the claim had no </p><p>stable boundaries, Tagish Jim held in his </p><p>own incontestable right a plot of ground </p><p>containing fifty-one and two-thirds acres, a </p><p>square plot in dimensions, though corru- </p><p>gated as to surface. </p><p> Sitting smoking upon a huge outjutting</p><p>boulder on the ridge, Sark and Bassett </p><p>watched Tagish complete the staking. </p><p>When the Chilcat had inscribed, he took </p><p>his ax and began to blaze more open his </p><p>location line. Below him another Chilcat </p><p>was working at the same thing, and belowr </p><p>that one, dim in the hazy distance and </p><p>moving like gnomes on the face of the </p><p>ridge, other Chilcats staked other claims. </p><p> ‘The hour’s about up,” announced Sark,</p><p>glancing at his watch. “They ought to be </p><p>all on the job now. Wonder how long it’ll </p><p>be before Casino sees them?” </p><p> “He has seen ’em,” declared Tom who</p><p>had been keeping an ear trained on the </p><p>creek limits. “Hear that rumpus in the </p><p>scrub? He’s cornin’ on the jump.” </p><p>BIN A moment the partners could </p><p>see several figures rushing up from </p><p>Casino’s camp where all the members </p><p>of the salted stampede were holding a jovial </p><p>session. Casino himseLf was in the lead, </p><p>with Ante, Gunboat, Slim and Alabama </p><p>straining after him, stumbling over rocks, </p><p>logs, stumps and crashing through patches </p><p>ol dense undergrowth. </p><p> “Hey you,” yelled Casino, catching sight</p><p>of Sark and Bassett and panting up to them </p><p>“What in tarnation’s afoot? Chilcat after</p><p>9 </p><p>Chilcat slips by us down-stream, and Chilcat </p><p>after Chilcat runs by us over our claims, </p><p>makin’ for yon ridge. They’re workin’ </p><p>there now, a whole string of them, like as if </p><p>they w’ere stakin’. What's in the air?" </p><p> “Ask Tagish Jim, thar,” suggested Bas-</p><p>sett. “We’re not doin’ this. He is.” </p><p> “What’s up, Tagish?” demanded Casino,</p><p>shouting at the Chilcat who was hewing </p><p>about a hundred yards down his location </p><p>line. </p><p> “Quartz!” grunted Tagish phlegmatic-</p><p>ally and without turning from his work. </p><p> “Quartz!” Casino echoed. “Then I was</p><p>right. I thought in my own mind the </p><p>cursed creek looked more like quartz than </p><p>placer. Didn’t you, Sark? Didn’t you, </p><p>Bassett?” </p><p> “We sure did,” the partners agreed.</p><p> “And wrhat kind of showin’ has the Chil-</p><p>cat got? Where’s his discovery stake?” </p><p>“Right back of you thar, behind that </p><p>outcrop. Wait. It’s a fair showin’. I’ll </p><p>flash it up for you.” Bassett stepped </p><p>across, kicked the loose dirt off the quartz </p><p>ledge and flared a match over the bared </p><p>vein. </p><p> “Thunderation!” screeched Casino.</p><p>“Fair showin’! It'll run four hundred dol- </p><p>lars to the ton. Look at it, boys, seams of </p><p>gold half an inch wide.” </p><p> Up behind Casino, leaning over his back</p><p>and shoulders, lying affectionately upon </p><p>his neck, crowded his four comrades. So </p><p>magnificent was the showing that it left </p><p>them well-nigh dumb. They could ga^p </p><p>nothing coherent of comment or description. </p><p>They could only breathe forth unintelligible </p><p>monosyllabic imprecations and stare wide- </p><p>eyed at the ledge. </p><p> “Stake boys, stake, fast as flesh and</p><p>blood'll let you,” Casino exhorted, heaving </p><p>the quartette off his back. “I’m goin’ in </p><p>next Tagish.” </p><p> “No, you ain’t, Casino,” differed Bassett,</p><p>catching him by the arm and whirling him </p><p>about in his first stride. “That ground next </p><p>Tagish is staked.” </p><p> “Tell me where I’ll stake, then,” implored</p><p>Casino frantically. “Where’d you stake </p><p>yourself?” </p><p> “I ain’t staked. I had already staked on</p><p>this creek, and by that action I surrendered </p><p>my rights. So did Eric. So did you and </p><p>Ante, Gunboat, Slim and Alabama.” </p><p> “W-what? That vein there spillin' over</p><p>splendiferous with gold and reachin’ clean</p><p>13°	Adventure</p><p>to the creek mouth by the run of the ridge, “Sure,” the Chilcat admitted, </p><p>and we can’t stake it.-' ’	“Told you where to stake, didn’t thev?”</p><p>“No. If it could ’a’ bin staked bv a “Sure.”	y</p><p>former staker on Fresno, I sure would ’a’ </p><p>done it this afternoon.” </p><p> “Oh! It’s your discovery is it?” snarled</p><p>Casino, a cold gleam of dawning under- </p><p>standing lighting his features. “You found </p><p>this nice little mint this afternoon?” </p><p> “Sure,” nodded Bassett, “huntin’ a tree</p><p>trunk for a shaft ladder. It looked good </p><p>on top of the two-dollar pan find, so 1 froze </p><p>on to it.” </p><p> “That was mighty considerate of you,</p><p>wasn’t it?” Casino gritted menacingly. </p><p>“Kicked dirt over it and kept it under </p><p>cover till your partner got back from Daw- </p><p>son City with the bunch of Chilcats. Free </p><p>men, them Chilcats, as hadn’t surrendered </p><p>their rights on Fresno, and they could </p><p>stake where they plagued well pleased. </p><p>They’re workin-’ for you. It ain’t no use </p><p>you deny in’ that you’ve grubstaked them </p><p>on this stunt. A chechako could see that. </p><p>Am I right?” </p><p> “I ain’t goin’ to tell you whether you’re</p><p>right or wrong or merely uncertain,” re- </p><p>turned Tom surlily. “It’s none of your </p><p>bizness anyway. Them Chilcats have </p><p>staked the hull vein clean to the mouth of </p><p>Fresno, seventeen claims in a string. The </p><p>claims is air-tight. Thar’s no use in your </p><p>jawin’, Casino. You may as well shut </p><p>your mouth and go back to your jubilant </p><p>camp.” </p><p> “Not on your blasted tin-types! Y'ou</p><p>think you can file seventeen quartz claims </p><p>on end and hog the whole thing, but you’ve </p><p>made a bad misplay. Tagish Jim, you </p><p>come here a minute!” </p><p> “You go to blim-blammed blazes!” re-</p><p>torted Tagish who w'as now a hundred and </p><p>fifty yards down the location line. “You </p><p>not my boss. Me not come when you call.” </p><p>“Tagish!” commanded Bassett, albeit </p><p>there was a chuckle in the command. “You </p><p>come here.” </p><p>AT ONCE the Chilcat dropped his </p><p>ax and strode back to the group on </p><p>the ledge. </p><p> “Tom my boss,” he insolently grinned at</p><p>the enraged Casino. “Me come when um </p><p>call.” </p><p> Casino glared and gulped—</p><p> “You workin’ for Sark and Bassett, ain't</p><p>you?” </p><p> “Grubstaked you, didn’t they? And own</p><p>half your winnings, don’t they?” </p><p> “Sure.”</p><p> All right, that II do for you. You can</p><p>go back to your as and the horny-handed </p><p>toil you seem to love so well. I ve asked </p><p>you all I wrant to know. The rest of my </p><p>palaver concerns your employers only.” </p><p>He wheeled on Sark and Bassett. </p><p> “You heard that hard-shelled heathen's</p><p>admissions? Well, so did Ante, Gunboat, </p><p>Slim and Alabama. They're my witnesses. </p><p>And if we took the matter to court and got </p><p>a rulin’ on it, just as sure as there’s gold in </p><p>that ledge, the court would view your action </p><p>as subterfuge in the face of your surrendered </p><p>rights and throw them seventeen claims </p><p>open to relocation. But law and courts are </p><p>slow. I’m for quick action. Now I ain’t </p><p>at all hoggish like you fellows, and I d' n't </p><p>ask you to throw any of then*, claims or .a </p><p>like the court would. All I ask you to io </p><p>is to sell us a half share in in m seven- </p><p>teen.” </p><p> “Bluff!'' sneered Bassett. “You know</p><p>the court wouldn't do any sich thing. They </p><p>couldn't. We stand within the lav. So </p><p>you try to play safe by buy in ’ a half share </p><p>in our ground. But I tell you out 1&lt; ud, </p><p>distinctly and with clear enunciation, </p><p>Casino, that we ain’t sellin’. Git me? We </p><p>—ain’t—sellin !” </p><p> “You will sell!” bellowed Casino, wrath-</p><p>fully shaking his fist under Tom’s nose. </p><p>“We’ll make you sell.” </p><p> “Go on and make, then,” challenged</p><p>Tom, arising with Sark from the boulder. </p><p>“Go on and make us. If Eric and me kin’i </p><p>trim the five of you, I'll bun’ my pick and </p><p>shovel and quit the Yukon in dishonor and </p><p>disgrace.” </p><p> “Mebbe you can trim the five of us. but</p><p>you sure can’t trim the forty-seven of us,” </p><p>Casino sent back. “There's forty-two men </p><p>at my camp yet.” </p><p> He stepped to the edge of the bench</p><p>ground and emitted a howl for help that </p><p>caused the rest of his comrades to suspend </p><p>their celebration at the camp and scramble </p><p>up the slope to his aid. </p><p> “What’s wTong, Casino?” demanded Hal-</p><p>pune, foremost of the forty-two. </p><p> “These ginks have found a quartz vein</p><p>three feet wide and almost solid gold. </p><p>Stolen Thunder </p><p>They’re gettin’ the Chilcats to stake, and </p><p>usurpin’ the whole thing.” </p><p> A violent roar went up from the crowd</p><p>at the announcement. It surged up to en-</p><p>gulf Casino, and Sark and Bassett suddenly </p><p>found themselves ringed in by forty-seven </p><p>half-drunken men, festering for trouble and </p><p>ready to do Casino’s wildest bidding. </p><p> “Will you sell?” shouted Casino through</p><p>the general clamor of the mob. </p><p> “Not by a drastic sight!” Sark roared at</p><p>him, his blood leaping at the nearness of </p><p>the fray. “Back to back, Tom. We'll die </p><p>game.” </p><p> “You dodderin’ fools!” Casino grated.</p><p>“We don’t want to kill you. But we sure </p><p>will unless you give in this minute. Sell! </p><p>Sell, I say, or we’ll hammer you to pulp and </p><p>throw the mess in the creek.” </p><p> “Come on and hammer, then,” invited</p><p>Sark. “There’ll be a few of you mashed </p><p>along with us.” </p><p>INSTANTLY the ugly ring closed </p><p>in. But Tom and Eric had scarcely </p><p>landed the first two blows when the </p><p>hurtling body of Tagish Jim, jumping off </p><p>the boulder above, launched through the </p><p>ring- </p><p> “Wait,” commanded the Chilcat. He</p><p>pushed back the foremost attackers. His </p><p>native stoicism had fallen from him, and </p><p>his words leaped out vociferously. “Me </p><p>own um claim. All um Chilcats own um </p><p>claims. We sell. We don’t want see um </p><p>bosses killed. We sell. But we sell whole </p><p>claims. No shares. Me speak for um all. </p><p>Me foreman.” </p><p> “Good! Better than ever!” exulted</p><p>Casino, clawing his way through his com- </p><p>rades toward Tagish Jim and pulling out </p><p>some paper from his pocket. “Here, I’ll </p><p>write bills of sale for the seventeen. You </p><p>sign. How much do you want?” </p><p> “Don’t you sell, Tagish! Don’t you sell1”</p><p>warned both Sark and Bassett. </p><p> They tried to lurch forward but could not</p><p>make progress, for in the moment of confusion </p><p>caused by Tagish Jim’s jump into the ring a </p><p>half-dozen antagonists had seized the arms </p><p>and legs of each, fettering theii action and </p><p>smothering Tom’s and Eric’s struggles by </p><p>sheer weight. </p><p> “Don’t you sell, Tagish! Don’t you sell!”</p><p>they reiterated, even in their futile es*av </p><p>at freedom. </p><p> “Me got to sell,” explained Tagish dep-</p><p>recatingly. “Me don’t, they kill you. Me </p><p>know. Dawson toughs. Drunk on hootch. </p><p>Me sell, all right.” </p><p> “How much, Tagish?” howled Casino</p><p>impatiently. </p><p> “Twelve thousand a claim!” quoted</p><p>Tagish. “Mebbe um not enough. But um </p><p>what Tom guessed little while ago.” </p><p> “Too steep!” whispered Ante and Gun-</p><p>boat to Casino. </p><p> “No, no,” Casino whispered back, scrib-</p><p>bling feverishly. “It runs four hundred or </p><p>over to the ton. I’ll swear it. Thirty tons </p><p>would pay for one claim. I’ll fix that figure, </p><p>for fear he has another think and goes </p><p>higher. Bassett’s a bad guesser. So—” </p><p>turning to Tagish—“here’s your bills of </p><p>sale. Twelve thousand a claim. And </p><p>here’s half your amount in the bills of sale </p><p>Sark and Bassett paid me and the rest. </p><p>One hundred and two thousand you savvy, </p><p>Tagish? The same cornin’ to you yet. I’ll </p><p>get the bunch to write it off. You go on </p><p>and sign.” </p><p>IN SPITE of shouted protests from </p><p>Sark and Basset, Tagish Jim signed. </p><p>Casino paid over to the Chilcat the </p><p>forty-seven bills of sale, totaling in value </p><p>one hundred and two thousand dollars, </p><p>which he had gotten from the partners for </p><p>the string of Fresno creek claims and called </p><p>on his comrades to sign for the amount of </p><p>the remainder. Jubilantly they did so, </p><p>adding their signatures to seventeen bills </p><p>of sale for the quartz claims to the tune of </p><p>six thousand dollars each, and the instant </p><p>the transaction was closed, Sark’s and Bas- </p><p>sett’s captors released them. </p><p> Tagish Jim stepped up to Tom with an</p><p>apologetic, almost cringing, manner and </p><p>presented him with the forty-seven bills of </p><p>sale Tom had originally paid out to Casino. </p><p> “Here um your share um grubstake,” he</p><p>intimated sheepishly. </p><p> Bassett shoved the bills of sale into his</p><p>pocket and glared at Tagish without a </p><p>word as the latter went forward to distribute </p><p>the proper portion to the other Chilcats </p><p>who were observed coming back in a body </p><p>from their staking and ambling up the slope. </p><p> “Six thousand bill um sale each um you</p><p>and me; Casino buy all um claims,” he told </p><p>them and they accepted with amazed grins. </p><p> “But the transaction ain’t valid. Casino!”</p><p>stormed Bassett, raising his voice to high </p><p>heaven in the anger of defeat. “If them </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Chilcats had ’a’ got back five minnits </p><p>sooner, thar wouldn’t ’a’ bin any transac- </p><p>tion at all. Thar’d a’ bin a geri'rul massa- </p><p>cre, anil you and your bunch would a’ bin </p><p>qualifyin’ right now for engraved epitaphs. </p><p> “Still, beware of llatterin’ yourself that</p><p>you win by the small margin of five minnits.</p><p>You don’t. On course, you forty-seven’ll </p><p>try to perjure me down, but 1 have here </p><p>eighteen responsible witnesses to prove that </p><p>them documents, the bills of sale for seven- </p><p>teen quart2 claims on end on Fresno Creek </p><p>were obtained by threat, under compulsion, </p><p>through application of force and extortion </p><p>and intimidation while Sark and me was </p><p>held incapable and in durance vile. </p><p> “I warn you that you and forty-six others</p><p>constrained us against our will and robbed us </p><p>of a quartz ledge three feet wide, twenty- </p><p>five thousand, five hundred feet long, run- </p><p>nin’ in your own words four hundred dollars </p><p>to the ton. Now the hull bunch of you jist </p><p>let them terms and figgers sink into your </p><p>dissipated consciousnesses. You’ll hear </p><p>’em agin. For I'll sure take this case to </p><p>the highest courts and prove my conten- </p><p>tion!” </p><p> “Like blazes you will!” laughed Casino.</p><p>“You can’t prove anythin’ anyway. And </p><p>even if you can, we’ll have a smelter built </p><p>and the stuff smelted down before you get </p><p>judgment. Courts are slow. As for me, </p><p>I’m for quick action. Halpune, give me </p><p>your pick!” </p><p> Halpune handed him the pick which with</p><p>the foresight of one accustomed to trouble </p><p>he had grasped at Casino’s first yell for </p><p>aid and carried with him up onto the </p><p>ridge. </p><p> “We’ll just knock out some of the stuff</p><p>and make a rough assay ourselves,” Casino </p><p>proposed, swinging the pick. “It runs </p><p>that rich.” </p><p>THE steel split off a big fragment </p><p>of the quartz with the first blow. </p><p>Casino picked it up and scratched </p><p>at the splendid seams. The splendid seams </p><p>came off in his hand. </p><p> “Leaf gold, Eric!” whispered Bassett in</p><p>the pregnant hush. “1 had a hull pocket- </p><p>book full of the foil, and I tamped her into </p><p>the seams on that ledge this afternoon!” </p><p> “You Shakespearean super, Tom, you</p><p>ought to be on the stage!” exclaimed Sark, </p><p>with a great laugh of revelation. “And </p><p>you ought to take Tagish Jim with you. </p><p>I see now yuu primed him while going ui» </p><p>the bench land." </p><p> Casino looked up at Eric’s laugh.</p><p> He looked down again at the stuff in his</p><p>hand. </p><p> “Leaf gold!” he yelled in disgust, and</p><p>whirled on Sark and Bassett with up- </p><p>raised pick. “You planted the treacher- </p><p>ous, worthless stuff and sold me a salt!”</p><p> “I ain’t sold you anythin’,” snickered</p><p>Tom, keeping a wary eye upon the pick. </p><p>“Ever\r man here knows I fought dead </p><p>aginst sell in’ to the last. You forced the </p><p>Chilcats to sell to you. And they’re the </p><p>only ones as benefited by the deal. You’ve </p><p>made ’em a present of six thousand dollars </p><p>apiece. Eric and me git back what you </p><p>skinned us outa by hikin’ us forth on a li.v 1 </p><p>stampede, plankin’ us down on two salted </p><p>claims prepared beforehand and enticin’ us </p><p>to buy up Fresno Creek. </p><p> “Saltin’s a game amateurs like you</p><p>shouldn’t play at? Casino. You’re sun- to cjit </p><p>pickled in the end. You’ve got a do;- of </p><p>your own medicine, and you alone kin tell </p><p>how it tastes. Now jist inform us if it tickles </p><p>your palate.

You de- </p><p>sirin’ any special brand of tr-mble. If you </p><p>ain’t, put down that pick!” </p><p> Casino glared malevolently at the pha-</p><p>lanx of Chilcats backing Sark and Bassett </p><p>under Tagish Jim’s direction. </p><p> Each man stood slx feet. Each was</p><p>muscled like a grizzly and endowed with a </p><p>grizzly’s strength. Each had a disconcert- </p><p>ing pair of black eyes which flashed sar- </p><p>donically at Casino through the half gloom, </p><p>betokening contempt, mingled with the </p><p>high hope of a conflict. </p><p> Casino saw their swarthy hands tightened</p><p>on the helves of the axes they carried and </p><p>their lithe frames all set for the spring, and </p><p>wisdom triumphed over his malevolence. </p><p>He dropped the pick. </p><p> “I’m not desirin’ any special brand of</p><p>trouble; I’m a man of peace!” he decided, </p><p>and motioned his forty-six recruits on the </p><p>downward path to camp. </p><p>FROM </p><p>OP </p><p>THE TIP </p><p>THE ROCKET </p><p> Albert</p><p> Payj'on</p><p> Terhune</p><p>Aulfwr of “The </p><p>“I VP ") M GLAD you’re as cross as </p><p>I you know how to be,” observed </p><p>H I Mai a. </p><p> I_JHt-J Perhaps the man did not hear.</p><p> Certainly he did not heed. He sat looking</p><p> blankly to westward, over the roofs of the</p><p> city.</p><p> “Because/' explained Maia brilliantly,</p><p> “then you can’t be any crosser than you</p><p> are.”</p><p> Even this perfect feminine logic did not</p><p> shake the man into a reply. Maia Garth</p><p> tried to crush him with a single look, but her</p><p> glare was wasted. He did not see. He did</p><p> not see anything but the line of black Pali-</p><p> sades to the westward—black against an</p><p> only less black sky.</p><p> Maia poked daintily with a waxed-paper</p><p> straw’ at a fugitive cherry that lurked elusive</p><p> amid the ice fields at the bottom of her long</p><p> glass. Then she looked—despairingly, this</p><p> time—at the man; and, noting his fixity of</p><p> look, let her own gaze follow his.</p><p> Out over the heat-baked roofs, dull and</p><p> misty, broken by rectangles of smoky,</p><p> furnace-like glare from the intersecting</p><p> streets she gazed; then over the dimmer</p><p> void that was the North River, to the inky</p><p> wall of rock, its crest picked out here and</p><p> there with diamond points of blue-white</p><p> electric lights, that stood out so primly</p><p> against the starless sky behind.</p><p> The spectacle did not inspire Maia. In-</p><p> deed, it vaguely depressed her. And,</p><p> coupled with her escort’s fixed abstraction^</p><p> it tended to bring on a fit of blues.</p><p> Treasure Jar."</p><p> To shake off the cloud, she turned east-</p><p> ward and leaned over so that she could see</p><p> above the parapet of the roof-garden into</p><p> whose far corner their table was ".•edged.</p><p> Here, forsooth, was a spectacle of life to</p><p> drive away the most persistent blues from</p><p> any one who dwelt upon the outer crust of</p><p> his own soul.</p><p> Below snapped and sparked joy! Real,</p><p> hand-made joy. A form of joy that it took</p><p> an aged and otherwise sajie Dutch city</p><p> three centuries to evolve.</p><p> The hot night air was vibrant with light</p><p> and sound. A swirl of color blended and</p><p> tinged the sky, from the hundred different</p><p> hues cast by Gargantuan electric signs—</p><p> signs that seemed to hang unstained in mid-</p><p> air, in the dark murk of the Summer eve-</p><p> ning.</p><p> And in this white street itself and in its</p><p> cross currents loafed and panted and swel-</p><p> tered the pleasure chasers, for few are</p><p> adrift on Broadway at nine o’clock of an</p><p> August night for anything but amusement</p><p> —amusement that is fresh and optimistic;</p><p> amusement that has grown stale unto bore-</p><p> dom; noisy or apathetic or shop-worn</p><p> amusement. Vet the lights, the crowds,</p><p> the racket, all merged into one rather stir-</p><p> ring note by the time they reached the alti-</p><p> tude of roof-garden parapet.</p><p> At any rate. Maia found it a vast im-</p><p> provement on watching a glum-faced man</p><p> eying a glum-faced line of Palisades. And</p><p> thus cheered, she tried to galvanise Mov-</p><p> lan Kiel back to life again.</p><p>133 </p><p>134 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> ‘ I can’t just now think,” she mused</p><p>aloud, “of a jollier way to spend an hour in </p><p>Summer than in the corner of a roof-garden, </p><p>looking from a sellzer-Iemonade glass that </p><p>is empty to a man whose expression makes </p><p>the glass seem brim full by contrast.” </p><p>“H’m!” murmured Kiel abstractedly. </p><p>“Perhaps so,” she agreed meekly. </p><p>“That’s one way of looking at it, of course. </p><p>Moylan, are you thinking of staying cranky </p><p>much longer? I only ask because the </p><p>Fraynes are over there at the fourth table. </p><p>And if you could set a time limit on your </p><p>sulkiness, I could go across and sit with </p><p>them till then. Or-” </p><p> Kiel came out of his abstraction with a</p><p>start. Some of her words, or else a sudden </p><p>realizing of her displeasure and of his own </p><p>remissness, seemed to revive him. </p><p> “That is Grantwood over there,” he an-</p><p>nounced, with a general gesture toward the </p><p>Palisade crest. “Somewhere along there; </p><p>just a little to the north, I think.” </p><p> “Wonderful!" she sighed in stark rap-</p><p>ture. “This is worth sitting up for! Grant- </p><p>wood! Oh, think of it! I’ll just step over </p><p>and tell the Fraynes. They’d love to </p><p>know.” </p><p> Kiel shifted his eyes from the west and</p><p>looked doubtfully at her. He had not </p><p>dearly understood. Her effort at irony had </p><p>quite escaped him. Now he tried to rally </p><p>his flagging attention. </p><p> “I—I beg your pardon,” he faltered con-</p><p>fusedly, “I-” </p><p> “It’s about time,” she announced, sar-</p><p>casm shifting in a breath to indignation, </p><p>as she caught the note of semi-penitence. </p><p>“When you asked me to come here with you </p><p>this evening, I was foolish enough to be a </p><p>little glad. Then you brought me to this </p><p>hole-in-a-corner table. And since you </p><p>ordered I don't think you’ve spoken twenty </p><p>words." </p><p> “I’m sorry. You see-”</p><p> “I don’t see. If you wanted to get on a</p><p>housetop and glower in dead silence at New </p><p>Jersey, why did you bring me along to </p><p>watch you do it? There are more exciting </p><p>ways for a girl to spend the evening. Moy- </p><p>lan!” she broke off sharply; for his </p><p>troubled eyes had left her face and </p><p>were once 'more fixed broodingly on the </p><p>Palisades. </p><p> This time her exclamation brought him</p><p>permanently to himself. </p><p> “I’m sorry,” he said again simply. “I</p><p>really am. It was rotten of me. Will—will </p><p>you let me tell you about it? ] didn't want </p><p>to—yet. I wanted it for a surprise. That’s </p><p>why 1 asked you to come here. But if it </p><p>was going to happen, it would have happen- </p><p>ed by now, I think. It’s quarter past nine. </p><p>And nine was the time he said-” </p><p> “If you 11 put it into English," she inter-</p><p>posed with labored patience, “perhaps I can </p><p>understand part of it. Start at the subject </p><p>before last. What about Grantwood? And </p><p>then, passing lightly to the next cage, who </p><p>is ‘he’?” </p><p> ‘ Grantwood,” said Kiel, “is one of the</p><p>dozen or so suburbs that fringe the lop of </p><p>the Palisades. Judge Gregg lives there.” </p><p>"And it’s out of friendship for your old </p><p>chief that you stare at the Palisades he </p><p>lives on? Loyal friend!” </p><p> “No," returned Kiel. "It’s to see what</p><p>he means to do.” </p><p> “Oh,” exclaimed Maia. “Certainly! If</p><p>only you had a night glass and watched </p><p>long enough you might even sec him wind </p><p>the clock and put out the cat." </p><p> “No,” he corrected, “I might see him</p><p>make my career, or set me adrift." </p><p>SHE looked at him keenly, and at </p><p>the stolid earnestness in his face, </p><p>her own lost its banter and annoy- </p><p>ance. Leaning forward, she touched ever so </p><p>lightly the tanned fists clenched together </p><p>on the table top. </p><p> “Tell me," she said softly.</p><p> “They want him to go back to Damas-</p><p>cus,” answered Kiel. “You know how </p><p>popular he was with the natives and the </p><p>Turkish Government while we were there, </p><p>he and I. I was only a kid at the time— </p><p>the youngest vice-consul in the East, they </p><p>said. But I was old enough to appreciate </p><p>all that Judge Gregg was doing for Uncle </p><p>Sam over there, and how he stood head ard </p><p>shoulders above the rest of the diplomatic </p><p>bunch.” </p><p> “You’ve told me. But I thought he came</p><p>back to his law practise here because he</p><p>was sick and tired of the East. Why should </p><p>he go again?” </p><p> “ ‘Once you’ve ’card the East a-callinY</p><p>chanted Kiel, villainously off key, “ ‘you </p><p>won’t ’eed nothin’ else.’ " </p><p> “But-”</p><p> “The Government wants him to go back.</p><p>The Syrians in New York have heard about </p><p>it, and they heard he was undecided. So </p><p>* </p><p>From the “Tip” of the Rocket </p><p>135 </p><p>they went over there tonight—a big dele- </p><p>gation of them—to wait on him; to make </p><p>orations and pleas and other Oriental argu- </p><p>ments to urge him to accept.” </p><p> “But you don’t think he will, do you?”</p><p>asked Maia in real concern. “Why, Moy- </p><p>lan, if he does, what will become of the plan </p><p>to take you into partnership? You’ve built </p><p>so on that plan, and-” </p><p> “I’ve built on it,” he returned grimly, “a</p><p>lot more than you can realize. Perhaps a </p><p>lot more than you can care. As one of the </p><p>hungry army of young lawyers in this over- </p><p>lawyered city I’m barely able to keep my </p><p>head above water. Another ounce of weight </p><p>would sink me. And—and I’ve been long- </p><p>ing lately to take on a good deal more than </p><p>an extra ounce. It’s meant everything to </p><p>me. I hadn’t any right to say so. I haven’t, </p><p>yet, till I’m perfectly certain the Judge </p><p>won’t accept.” </p><p> His tone sent a faint red to her throat and</p><p>forehead, and her breath came a little faster. </p><p>But, as he paused, she did not reply. </p><p> “The Judge solved it all when he offered</p><p>me the partnership the other day,” went </p><p>on Kiel. “As his partner my future was </p><p>assured. He made the offer conditional on </p><p>his refusing the Damascus job; but I gath- </p><p>ered that he didn’t mean to take it. It’s </p><p>always hard to tell just what good old </p><p>Gregg will do. His training in law, and in </p><p>diplomacy too, has made him pretty secre- </p><p>tive. If he takes me into partnership I’m </p><p>made. If he goes to Syria I’m goin", too.” </p><p>“No!”	b</p><p> The negation broke involuntarily through</p><p>Maia Garth's paling lips; and at'the word </p><p>a light crept into the man’s eyes. </p><p> “I hope I won’t have to,” said he. “I’m</p><p>not going as his vice-consul, as I went be- </p><p>fore. There’s no future in that. I’m going </p><p>to make money. I know how it can be done </p><p>over there— in a huriy, too. A single </p><p>stake. And the winning end of that stake </p><p>is fortune. A chap tried it while I was at</p><p>Damascus.” </p><p> “And he won the fortune.”</p><p> “No " hesitated Kiel. “He blundered.</p><p>And he won—the other thing. But I </p><p>sha n t. I figured out the whole business, </p><p>long ago, just as a matter of curiosity. And </p><p>sifety°” a Way t0 d° R ‘n SafCty’ Pen*ect </p><p> “What do you mean?”</p><p> “I’m sick of plodding along on nothing a</p><p>week and ol working ten hours a day to get </p><p>it. I manage to get bread, a roof and cheap </p><p>clothes. That is all. If this partnership </p><p>scheme falls through, I mean to win enough </p><p>at a single throw to put me on ‘Easy Street’ </p><p>—enough to give me the one thing in life I </p><p>want.” </p><p> “But what is this ‘single throw’? What is</p><p>the venture that you say is safe for you, but </p><p>that seems to have cost some one else his </p><p>life?” </p><p> She spoke with growing uneasiness. For</p><p>the first time he withdrew his gaze wholly </p><p>from the dark west and looked steadily at </p><p>her. </p><p> “The Shcm-es-Nabihe made answer,</p><p>half whispering the words. </p><p> “If you are beginning to talk Arabic</p><p>again,” she said vexedly, “just stop to re- </p><p>member that all of us haven’t had your </p><p>advantage of being the son of a missionary </p><p>and of spending our childhood in Syria. A </p><p>few of us are more at home with our own </p><p>language.” </p><p> “The *Shem-es-Nabi,’ " he explained, too</p><p>eager to be rebuffed by the interruption,“is </p><p>literally, ‘The Sun of the Prophet.’ It was </p><p>Mohammed’s signet-ring.” </p><p> “Oh!”</p><p> “It was the ring that Mohammed took</p><p>from the dead hand of the Negus of Abys- </p><p>sinia, who was slain in battle by the Mos- </p><p>lem hordes, back in the seventh century. </p><p>It was supposed to be a talisman of vast </p><p>power. The Negus had looted it from a </p><p>Parsee shrine. On the jade stone of the </p><p>ring is carved a rising sun. And there are </p><p>hieroglyphs under it.” </p><p> “What about it?”</p><p> “It is one of the ‘Six Treasures of the</p><p>Moslem Faith.’ The Islamites look on it </p><p>with a veneration that couldn’t make you </p><p>understand. It is kept under guard at the </p><p>Scrail in Damascus, and it is on view only </p><p>three times a year. It will next be shown </p><p>four weeks from today. And if Judge </p><p>Gregg upsets my hopes by going to the </p><p>East again, I’m going to take it, that day.” </p><p> “Are you crazy?”</p><p> “Not yet.”</p><p> “But how-”</p><p> “A silver-gilt reproduction of the Skem-</p><p>cs~Nabi was made by the Sultan’s orders, </p><p>years ago, and given to Judge Gregg as a </p><p>special mark of honor. Only a fair copy, </p><p>but good enough to deceive a casual on- </p><p>looker—especially in the dim light of the </p><p>Serail. The Judge gave it to me as a </p><p>136 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>memento when we left Damascus. 1 have it </p><p>at home. It would be easy for a man who </p><p>was quick with his hands to substitute it </p><p>for th« real treasure and to get out of the </p><p>city before the exchange could be found </p><p>out." </p><p> “The exchange? The theft, you mean!</p><p>If I didn’t know you were joking-” </p><p> “How would it be theft? Whose ring is</p><p>it? Mohammed stole it from the dead </p><p>Negus and the Negus first stole it from a </p><p>Parsee temple, to which it had probably </p><p>been brought as a votive offering by the </p><p>general or the sheik who stole it from its </p><p>original sun-worshiping owner. One can’t </p><p>well steal what is already stolen and whose </p><p>rightful ownership was buried in obscurity </p><p>nearly a thousand years ago. The ring is as </p><p>much mine, or yours, or anybody’s, as it is </p><p>the Turkish Government’s.” </p><p> “That’s sophistry.”</p><p> “That’s sense. But we don’t need to</p><p>ar ue it. For I'm perfectly sure now that </p><p>there’ll be no need to go for it. But if there </p><p>were—well, the Sultan’s people would pay </p><p>enough for the ring's return to keep me com- </p><p>fortable forever. And then a while longer.” </p><p>“You’d probably be caught.” </p><p> “No, I know the country too well. I’d</p><p>have framed up my line of escape. And </p><p>when I got back here I’d treat with Turkey </p><p>at long range." </p><p> “It’s horrible! And however much you</p><p>gloss it over it wouldn't be honest. I’m glad </p><p>you don’t have to do it. But why do you </p><p>say there’ll be no need to go? A few min- </p><p>utes ago you were afraid Judge Gregg </p><p>might-” </p><p> “The delegation must have finished its</p><p>addresses and its pleas half an hour ago. </p><p>And he has refused.” </p><p> “What makes you think so?”</p><p> “I know the Syrian customs. And I</p><p>know from Krikorian, their chairman, that </p><p>they’ve brought along the usual big box of </p><p>fireworks. If the Judge’s answer were </p><p>‘yes,’ then—a hundred dollars’ worth of</p><p>fireworks in ten minutes; and three hours’ </p><p>lawn-cleaning for the Judge’s gardener to- </p><p>morrow morning. That s why I watched </p><p>the Palisades so closely, till long after nine </p><p>o’clock.” </p><p> “Oh, 1 see! And I thought you were</p><p>sulking. I'm sorry I-" </p><p> “Sulking? Worse than that. It meant</p><p>everything to me; the loss of everything </p><p>I’d been longing for; the need to go out to </p><p>Damascus on my great venture. Do you </p><p>wonder I couldn’t see or hear anything else </p><p>till the danger grew less?” </p><p> “But why didn't you tell me beforehand?</p><p>Then we could have watched together.” </p><p>“Because 1 was afraid to. Because J was </p><p>afraid 1 wouldn’t he able to tell you without </p><p>telling you something else—something I'm </p><p>going to tell you, whether y*&gt;u want to </p><p>hear it or not, the moment I’m certain </p><p>there’s no chance of his accepting. Do you </p><p>mind if I leave you for a minute? It s a </p><p>certainty by this time that he’s refused. </p><p>But I want to call him up and clinch it. </p><p>Till then I've no right to say-” </p><p>A LITTLE gasp from the girl broke </p><p>in on his speech. Her face had </p><p>whitened and her eyes all at once </p><p>had grown larger. </p><p> Moylan Kiel saw that she had shifted in</p><p>her chair and was staring westward. He </p><p>whirled back to his neglected post of vigil </p><p>in time to see a red rocket burst high in air </p><p>above the Palisades, just to the north, ^hov.-- </p><p>ering the black night with sj arks a.nd j- is </p><p>of falling scarlet flame. </p><p> Man and girl looked at each other in</p><p>tense silence for a full minute; while a second </p><p>rocket, then a third and a fourth, cut hup </p><p>hairy arcs in the dull Jersey sky and </p><p>strewed the lower air with their varicolored </p><p>stars. </p><p> Then Moylan Kiel rose just a little un-</p><p>steadily to his feet and held out his hand. </p><p> “Do you mind,” he asked quietly, “if we</p><p>go home now? There’s a French liner sail- </p><p>ing at dawn. And I’ve a bit of packing to </p><p>do.” </p><p> “A French liner?” she echoed vaguely.</p><p>“To Havre,” he explained, as if laying </p><p>out a tour for some one in whom he felt </p><p>no interest. “Then across by land to </p><p>Marseilles. I'll just catch a messagerie </p><p>boat there for Tort Said. Three days at </p><p>most from there to Damascus. Perhaps </p><p>two, if I can make the right-” </p><p> “Damascus! Moylan, you’re not-”</p><p> “Please don’t,” he begged her very</p><p>gently. “Shall we go now?” </p><p> Dumb from plenitude of speech rather</p><p>than from its dearth, she followed him to the </p><p>elevator. A backward glance showed her </p><p>the western skyline, at one point, fairly </p><p>snapping with fireworks that danced and </p><p>whizzed and sputtered, and otherwise pro- </p><p>faned the solemn night of Summer. </p><p>mi </p><p>From the “Tip” of the Rocket </p><p>137 </p><p> She said no word, nor did Kiel, as they</p><p>chugged uptown in a wheezing taxicab </p><p>through the sick heat and smells of the </p><p>streets. But, the door of the Garth apart- </p><p>ment reached, and the motor-brigand dis- </p><p>missed, Maia spoke her mind. She spoke </p><p>it briefly and in a low tone, but very much </p><p>to the point. </p><p> She told the sullenly listening Kiel just</p><p>what a criminally reckless and recklessly </p><p>criminal exploit he was planning. She </p><p>proved clearly that no man in his senses </p><p>would set forth on such an errand, and that </p><p>no one who was not at heart dishonest could </p><p>so much ns give the scheme a second </p><p>thought. </p><p> She said he would break her heart with</p><p>worry. Also that she should not give him </p><p>a second thought nor would she care what </p><p>might befall so evil a man. She told him </p><p>that the taking of the Shem-cs-Nabi w'ould </p><p>be wicked theft that no wretched legal </p><p>sophistry could condone, and that a man </p><p>who could do such a thing and make any </p><p>girl so miserably unhappy by going into </p><p>danger was not worthy her bothering over. </p><p> She did not play the virago, nor did she</p><p>cry. She was a brave little girl. Her voice </p><p>shook, it is true, and she spoke very fast— </p><p>in fact, some of her wrords and even sen- </p><p>tences had to be guessed, and Moylan </p><p>guessed them with fearful correctness. </p><p> One thing, however, she did not leave to</p><p>his imagination nor to the chances of guess- </p><p>work. At the end of her little speech, and </p><p>when a bad cold began to impede her dic- </p><p>tion, she said slowly and distinctly that if </p><p>Kiel should persist in his wildly sinful in- </p><p>tent he need never, never come to see her— </p><p>or try to communicate with her upon his </p><p>return. The acquaintance would end, here </p><p>and now. </p><p> To which he retorted that if he did not go</p><p>the acquaintance must end anyhow, since </p><p>he had reached the point where it could no </p><p>longer be mere acquaintance, and as </p><p>finances wrould never, under present condi-</p><p>tions, reach the stage w'here it could be any- </p><p>thing stronger. </p><p> With which grumbled morsel of repartee</p><p>he ljssed her, before she could prevent him, </p><p>a.nd then strode tragically and rapidly away </p><p>before she could rebuke him—a double un- </p><p>iairness that was perhaps the cause of her </p><p>sleepless and somewhat lacrimosc night </p><p>At daybreak Maia called up Kiel’s rooms. </p><p>She had tramed a new and absolutely irrefu- </p><p>table set of arguments against his going to </p><p>Syria, but she had no chance to deliver </p><p>them. For, after a century’s w’ait, Central </p><p>reported with blithe optimism— </p><p> “909090 Gram’cy don’t seem to answer.”</p><p>Then Maia called up Judge Gregg, whom </p><p>she had never met. </p><p> The telephone toll from New York to</p><p>Grantwood-on-the-Palisades is ten cents </p><p>for five minutes. Maia’s total bill was </p><p>ninety cents. And at that she continued the </p><p>talk, an hour later, in the Judge’s Nassau </p><p>Street office. And many times thereafter. </p><p>n </p><p>“LA ILLAHA ILLA 'LLAff/” </p><p>smugly intoned an Im&amp;m. in pious </p><p>and questioning salutation of the </p><p>somewhat foreign-looking devotee in native </p><p>garb who lounged past him out of the Scrail </p><p>at Damascus, just four weeks later. </p><p> And the man who the Imam had at first</p><p>thought might be an outlander infidel ut- </p><p>terly disarmed suspicion by whining unc- </p><p>tuously in flawless Syrian Arabic— </p><p> “Sdtdna Md’moud rasdul Alldlil '</p><p> With which speech Moylan Kiel slouched</p><p>forth from the Government building with </p><p>the Shem-cs-Nabi safely reposing in the </p><p>breast of his abich. </p><p> He went at snail’s pace until he rounded</p><p>the comer. Then, tucking up his robe, he </p><p>ran at tcp speed through twisty streets and </p><p>foul alleyways until he reached the native </p><p>house where he lodged. </p><p> Safe in his stone-floored room there, he</p><p>drew forth the ring and laid it on a tabouret </p><p>near the one small barred window. The </p><p>light was better than in the Scrail treasure </p><p>room, but not brilliant. So far as Kiel </p><p>could see by it, the Shcm-cs-lYabi was not </p><p>greatly different, on close examination, from </p><p>the imitation he had so deftly substituted </p><p>for it. </p><p> The band of gold was old and badly worn,</p><p>so badly that its row of hieroglyphs was </p><p>well-nigh effaced. There w'as a crack across </p><p>the jade stone, splitting transversely the </p><p>rude caning of a rising sun.</p><p> From its general aspect, Kiel judged that</p><p>an antiquary might have given ten dollars </p><p>for the ring, as it stood. Scarcely more. </p><p>Yet this w'as one of Islam's Six Treasures— </p><p>the relic supposedly endowed with magic </p><p>powers, which the Prophet himself had </p><p>handed down as an all-prized heirloom to </p><p>Adventure </p><p>those of the Faith who should come after </p><p>him. For more than twelve hundred years </p><p>it had been guarded with adoring reverence, </p><p>none of Islam’s sons for a moment question- </p><p>ing its potency. </p><p> For a treasure so jealously watched over,</p><p>its theft had been absurdly easy. </p><p> Kiel had reached Damascus but a day</p><p>or two before the thrice-a-year exhibition of </p><p>the Relics, at the Serail. There, vouched </p><p>for by a local muezzin—whose total lack, of </p><p>previous acquaintance with the foreigner </p><p>was easily bridged by a judicious use of </p><p>bakshish—he had entered the treasure </p><p>chamber with a line of devotees. </p><p> As he passed the guarded little shrine he</p><p>had stumbled awkwardly over the hem of </p><p>his robe, had lurched forward and had </p><p>caught at the shrine to save himself from </p><p>falling. Then as two soldiers and a priest </p><p>had sprung at him he had recovered his </p><p>balance, salaaming low. And as soon as </p><p>possible he had withdrawn from the room </p><p>and from the building, having neatly palmed </p><p>the ring and left in its place the substitute </p><p>presented to him by Judge Gregg. </p><p> Now that the first and worst peril was</p><p>past, his wits rose to the next step. Within </p><p>an hour or two the room at the Serail would </p><p>be closed. The ring and the other treasures </p><p>would be put back in their proper resting </p><p>places. Then, infallibly, the guardian of </p><p>the Shem-es-Nabi would discover the fraud, </p><p>and the alarm would flash throughout all </p><p>the Moslem world. </p><p> Fanatic zeal would wing the search, and</p><p>that search would be of a sort not lightly </p><p>eluded. Yes, and if it were not successfully </p><p>eluded, there would be consequences that </p><p>Moylan Kiel did not care to contemplate. </p><p>There is no legal death penalty in Turkish </p><p>dominions, but criminals sometimes disap- </p><p>pear, and when they do they arc seldom </p><p>found again, even in sections. </p><p> Clearly, there was no time to be lost in</p><p>getting out of the Ottoman Empire. The </p><p>shortest way to the coast from Damascus is </p><p>by way of Beirut. Next to that, a journey </p><p>southward to Jerusalem and JalTa, or a trip </p><p>over the mountains westward to Tyre or</p><p>Sidon, or some other coast town where ships </p><p>touch. </p><p> Wherefore, as Kiel had already fore-</p><p>casted, every one of those ports would be </p><p>watched with a vigilance that would make </p><p>the all-seeing Eye of Mormonism seem </p><p>strabismic. The customs folk, with an </p><p>array of police-spy helpers, would infallibly </p><p>search to the skin every departing native or </p><p>tourist. </p><p> And Kiel had laid his plans according! v.</p><p> Having wasted a bare half minute in the</p><p>inspection of his booty, he wrapped the ring </p><p>in a dirty amulet case such as desert trav- </p><p>elers wear, and strapped it firmly beneath </p><p>the bend of his left knee. He covered this </p><p>strap with a ragged cloth on which were </p><p>traces of dried blood. It was a typical Syr- </p><p>ian bandage—one that would have brought </p><p>tears of horror to the eyes of a first-year </p><p>medical student. </p><p> Then, arranging his small hoard of money</p><p>in a turban and putting it on his head, he </p><p>wrapped his other belongings in a big bun- </p><p>dle, slung it over liis shoulder and, with a </p><p>serviceable old-fashioned arm} pistol stuck </p><p>prominently in his belt, sallied forth. </p><p> Through an alley he wound his way.</p><p>Thence to the bazaar section, with its </p><p>rat tan-woven roofs of brown, through </p><p>which the East’s yellow light filters coolly </p><p>down upon the shop-lined byways. The </p><p>bazaars were crowded, for the heat of tl.e </p><p>day was passing, and Kiel was forced lo </p><p>slacken his pace more than once as the foot- </p><p>crowds wyere jostled aside to permit the </p><p>passing of some laden camel or string of </p><p>donkeys, or a rich man s horse. </p><p> The bazaars were left behind, after an</p><p>interminable time, and he swung out into </p><p>the clearer passage of “The Street That </p><p>Is Called Straight"— the oldest street, with </p><p>a name, on earth. </p><p> In time this merged into walled orchards</p><p>and then into open spaces where scavenger </p><p>dogs and black-winged gray crows squab- </p><p>bled over carrion. </p><p> A final turn brought Kiel into a field</p><p>w'here a swarm of men were loafing idly </p><p>about a dozen busy natives who were en- </p><p>gaged in arranging loads upon the backs of </p><p>as many kneeling camels. </p><p> This was Kiel’s first stopping-place, and</p><p>he drifted unobserved into the throng of on- </p><p>lookers. </p><p> “Ohll” a gorilla-faced man in a once-</p><p>wiutecaftan and a green turban was squall- </p><p>ing. “Oh*f, Mulai, brother of ten thousand</p><p>infidels! How can the leader canicl move </p><p>without a breaking back when you load her </p><p>with three hundred pounds on the left side </p><p>and with but two hundred on the right? </p><p>Is her baok as unbalanced as your swinish </p><p>brain, O descendant of the donkey folk. </p><p>From the “Tip” of the Rocket </p><p>139 </p><p> He bustled off to where a mangy dun</p><p>camel was kneeling, and to a fat giant </p><p>near the beast's head he shouted furiously: </p><p> “Imshi, Child of Gehenna! Be off to the</p><p>gutters where you belong. Where learned </p><p>you to load a caravan camel? How think </p><p>you the brute will rest at night when on </p><p>neither side, as he kneels, the load touches </p><p>the ground? Shall we be dragging after us </p><p>a worn-out saddle-galled camel before the </p><p>third day? Halil, show this fool of many </p><p>thumbs how to adjust the load." </p><p> From camel to camel the caravan owner</p><p>moved, now nodding with an approving </p><p>grunt, now shrieking imprecations whose </p><p>utterances seemed to threaten him with </p><p>apoplexy. To his men—as to all Oriental </p><p>porters—this tirade was a daily affair, and </p><p>they took it with true Eastern apathy. </p><p>AS THE owner paused a moment </p><p>on his tour, Kiel approached him. </p><p>“O Brother of Giants,” said Moy- </p><p>lan ceremoniously, “may you lie where rose </p><p>leaves shall fall upon your tomb!” </p><p> “May you live to scatter them there!”</p><p>surlily vouchsafed the owner. </p><p> Not that he had the remotest wish of the</p><p>sort nor even a rudimentary desire to be </p><p>civil. But the Oriental etiquette, which </p><p>demands that a conversation open with a </p><p>compliment, also demands that the initial </p><p>compliment be capped by one more florid, </p><p>and this foreign-looking stranger looked too </p><p>prosperous for the caravan owner to kick. </p><p> “You start for Bagdad?” queried Kiel.</p><p> “Yes,” returned the owner more inter-</p><p>estedly. “Have you freight? My journey </p><p>is thirty-five days, to the hour. I have one </p><p>camel—by the grace of Allah and to your </p><p>own blessed fortune—that is not laden. </p><p>Five hundred pounds she can bear. And my </p><p>price for safe delivery of her cargo will be </p><p>but-” </p><p> “I have no freight.”</p><p> The owner, in disgust, turned back to his</p><p>work of supervision. He had no time and </p><p>less inclination for answering idle queries. </p><p> But I wish to go as a passenger,” an-</p><p>nounced Kiel, loudly enough for all around </p><p>him to hear, and speaking with a studied</p><p>nervousness. “I am in haste to reach Bag- </p><p>dad. Can you let me ride with you and </p><p>spare me food?” </p><p> No! snarled the owner.</p><p> hismillahcarelessly returned Moylan,</p><p>and walked off. </p><p> The owner let him go a few steps. Then,</p><p>finding he showed no sign of coming back, </p><p>ran after him. </p><p> “One hundred mcdjidiehe said.</p><p> “Robbery!” wailed Kiel.</p><p> “The miles of the journey are long, O</p><p>Effendi!” explained the native. </p><p> “But the feet of my brother’s camels are</p><p>swift as the wings of the day," replied Kiel, </p><p>in true Eastern bargain tone, “and the}' are </p><p>in grace like to the sacred beast that bore </p><p>the Prophet—on whom be peaces—from </p><p>Medina. I am stricken and poor. I do not </p><p>own a hundred medjidie </p><p> “Eighty-nine,” countered the camel-man,</p><p>now in his element as a trafficker. </p><p> “Inshallahl Is my purse so red with gold?</p><p>I am poor. What says the blest Koran? </p><p>‘He that hearkeneth not unto the cry of the </p><p>True Believer who is needy-’ ” </p><p> “Eighty,” retorted the other.</p><p> “It is sheer theft!” moaned Kiel right</p><p>loudly. “But my need is great. I accept!” </p><p> The camel-man had great ado to keep</p><p>from bursting into tears. He had asked a </p><p>hundred medjidi€ for a passage worth thirty. </p><p>And he had hoped by judicious bargaining </p><p>to get his customer to pay forty. Now, </p><p>starting at a hundred, he had been taken up </p><p>when he got to eighty. And he cursed his </p><p>stars that he had not in the first place de- </p><p>manded from the spendthrift fool five hun- </p><p>dred. </p><p> The listening crowd, too, murmured</p><p>loudly in wonder at such a bargain. </p><p>Tongues were certain to wag in the bazaars </p><p>on the morrow anent the man whose need </p><p>for instant departure from Damascus was </p><p>so great that he paid almost treble the </p><p>regulation passage money for the privi- </p><p>lege. </p><p> “Eighty medjidie.” the discomfited owner</p><p>at last found breath to acknowledge, adding </p><p>as a clever afterthought: </p><p> “Half in advance. The rest at the oasis</p><p>of-” </p><p> A commotion from the rear of the crowd</p><p>drew all eyes away from the chaffering. </p><p>The hero of the place had just come into the </p><p>Square of Caravans. He was a huge negro, </p><p>clad in spotless white; a kinky beard and </p><p>shaven upper lip distinguishing him fr*:&gt;m</p><p>the other blacks scattered through the </p><p>throng. </p><p> His reception by the idlers reminded Kiel</p><p>strongly of the entrance of Escamillo, the </p><p>Toreador, in “Carmen.” </p><p>140 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> This black giant was a local hero, the</p><p>demigod of loafers and camel-men alike. </p><p>Even the arrogant little caravan owner </p><p>deigned to smile pleasantly at him, for </p><p>the newcomer was the great Ben Nassar </p><p>Raad, mail-carrier between Damascus and </p><p>Bagdad. Where the ordinary plodding </p><p>caravan took from five to six weeks to </p><p>make the tedious journey across the Sy- </p><p>rian Desert, Raad on his Bisharin racing </p><p>camel covered the distance in ten brief days </p><p>—a feat that called forth the wondering </p><p>admiration of all Syria. </p><p> To him sand-storm, Bedouin raid, perils</p><p>of thirst, of sickness, of sunstroke, were mat- </p><p>ters for easy scorn. Was he not the fearless </p><p>Raad whom no less a personage than the </p><p>Pasha himself was wont to salute in the </p><p>bazaar? </p><p> Kiel grudgingly paid down his forty</p><p>medjidie advance money to the caravan </p><p>owner, finding and counting out each piece </p><p>with a separate groan. As he finished the </p><p>operation his glance momentarily crossed </p><p>that of Raad—Raad whose pet he had been </p><p>as a child, in the mission house at Nabous </p><p>—Raad, with whom he had passed an im- </p><p>portant hour the previous day—Raad, w'ho </p><p>at this minute had in his money-belt three </p><p>hundred medjidie which Kiel had turned </p><p>over to him twenty-four hours earlier. </p><p> The negro’s gaze traveled carelessly past</p><p>Kiel, and the redoubtable mail-carrier con- </p><p>tinued on his way to the corner of the field </p><p>where his two camels were cared for by a </p><p>black attendant. </p><p> Between these two camels and those of</p><p>the caravan there was as much difference </p><p>as between a Percheron and a thoroughbred </p><p>race horse. Gray-white in hue, they were </p><p>clean of limb, graceful as fawns, unbelieva- </p><p>bly swift. </p><p> One was for Raad’s use; the other was to</p><p>traverse the desert journey, alongside, in </p><p>case of accident or emergency. He rode </p><p>each on alternate trips. </p><p> Both now were well rested from the last</p><p>jaunt from Bagdad. Their spongy feet were </p><p>free from abrasions. Their humps were </p><p>hi"h and~pendulous. At a pinch, and if not </p><p>meantime supplied with water, both were</p><p>able to travel a hundred leagues, across </p><p>desert sands, in five days. </p><p> But at the end of such a forced ride their</p><p>humps would be little larger than a man’s </p><p>two lists, and they would be as savage as </p><p>sick bears. And, after stopping for water, </p><p>they would be loggy and slow for the next, </p><p>two days. </p><p> “The mail-carrier starts when we do?”</p><p>Kiel asked the caravan owner. </p><p> “Not he!” sneered the latter. "He is too</p><p>proud to start with common folk. And he </p><p>starts after star-shine, that he may make </p><p>his first twelve hours in the cool. Mount </p><p>your camel, Effendi. We start. Ml eh!” </p><p> His cry of “Mlehl” was taken up by his</p><p>men. Kiel jumped to his kneeling mount. </p><p>Grunting and bubbling, the twelve heavy- </p><p>laden draft camels scrambled to their feet </p><p>and, of their own accord, took their proper </p><p>alignment for the march. </p><p> It was not Moylan Kiel’s first, nor hun-</p><p>dredth, experience in the unlovely art of </p><p>camel riding. He understood the knack of </p><p>getting into the divan-like, high-pommeled </p><p>saddle and, once there, how to dispose of </p><p>the painful excess of leg length that such a </p><p>position always develops. </p><p> He did not even feel the almost universal</p><p>qualm that assails amateur riders when a </p><p>camel rises pitchingly to its feet and strikes </p><p>its gait—a gait not unlike the motion on a </p><p>ship deck in a choppy sea. </p><p> Off moved the twelve-beast caravan in</p><p>triple alignment, four deep, sixty feet be- </p><p>tween ranks, out of the Square of the Cara- </p><p>vans and outward toward the barely visible </p><p>strip of sand that lay like a yellow sword- </p><p>blade, a day’s journey to the northeast. </p><p> Kiel settled himself, as nearly comfort-</p><p>able as an outlander may, on liis huge saddle. </p><p>He caught the rough, sagging motion and </p><p>swayed his body, native fashion, to it. He </p><p>was the only rider. The natives at this </p><p>early stage of the journey chose to plod afoot </p><p>beside their ungainly charges. Later, when </p><p>the desert sands should begin to burn the </p><p>feet and the desert suns to play unholy </p><p>tricks with the eyes, they would be clamor- </p><p>ing for their turn to climb atop the more </p><p>lightly burdened of the brutes. </p><p> The owner, first removing from his feet</p><p>a pair of vehemently scarlet slippers and </p><p>slinging them over his shoulder for safety, </p><p>took his place at the head of the caravan. </p><p>A tiny gray bell-donkcy pattered sturdil} </p><p>at his side—the donkey that is the mascot, </p><p>the real guide, the highly important leader</p><p>of evenr Svrian caravan. </p><p> Camels* may bolt, may sulk, may go</p><p>musth, may exhibit in any fifty ways an </p><p>artistic temperament that would make .1 </p><p>prima donna seem stolid by comparison </p><p>From the “Tip” of the Rocket </p><p>141 </p><p>indeed, they usually do. At such times all </p><p>human power over them sinks into obscurity </p><p>compared to the control exerted by that </p><p>one sober little gray donkey. The tinkle </p><p>of its bell is more potent than the frenzied </p><p>howls of all the professional drivers in </p><p>Islamlik. </p><p> Kiel remembered, from his vice-consular</p><p>days, the case of a quasi-humorous Ameri- </p><p>can who had been haled to the Damascus </p><p>Serai!, on the grave accusation of Icsc-maj- </p><p>esfc, for propounding to his Syrian dragoman </p><p>the conundrum— </p><p> “Why is the Ottoman Empire like a</p><p>string of camels?” </p><p> The answer, “Because it is led by a</p><p>donkey,” had been taken by the dragoman </p><p>as of doubtful compliment to the Sultan. </p><p>He had so reported it, and Judge Gregg </p><p>had needed all the influence of the consulate </p><p>to clear the ribald one. </p><p> Kiel, familiar with the surrounding coun-</p><p>try, knew to an inch where the caravan </p><p>would rest for the night. He knew, too, </p><p>that the present jolting would be of short </p><p>duration, since, whether a caravan starts </p><p>at dawn or at dusk, its first day’s journey </p><p>i.s precisely forty furlongs—no more nor less </p><p>—and it has been so from the birth of history, </p><p>for what cause no living man knows, any </p><p>more than it is known why the universal </p><p>speed of all camel caravans is gaged to the </p><p>second at sixteen furlongs an hour. </p><p> Wherefore, by Kiel’s calculations, the</p><p>night’s rest would occur a hundred yards </p><p>beyond the Tomb of Assad, five miles from </p><p>the Square of the Caravans, and the halt </p><p>would be called in just two and one-half </p><p>hours from the time of starting. It was to </p><p>prevent a premature halt that the start </p><p>had been delayed until after the late after- </p><p>noon call to prayer. </p><p> The forecast was wholly correct, as fore-</p><p>casts involving Eastern customs—but not </p><p>Eastern temperaments—are more than </p><p>reasonably certain to be. Just beyond the </p><p>tomb the camels were made to kneel, and </p><p>there, still laden, they were left for the </p><p>night while fires were lighted and food pre- </p><p>pared.	r</p><p> His labors and his vocal efforts momen-</p><p>tarily ended, the caravan owner looked </p><p>about for his passenger, with whom he had </p><p>decided, dunng the five-mile walk, to have </p><p>a most interesting and profitable conversa- </p><p>tion. </p><p> He was barely in time to see Kiel walk-</p><p>ing slowly awa}r from the firelight radius </p><p>out into the starry darkness, to southward, </p><p>his bundle over his back. That a man </p><p>should needlessly cany any burden was be- </p><p>yond the grasp of the owner’s Oriental </p><p>mind, and he inferred that Kiel, stretching </p><p>his legs after the ride, had feared to leave </p><p>his bundle behind lest it be looted. </p><p> The incident gave the Syrian a desirable</p><p>peg whereon to hang his carefully prepared </p><p>talk. </p><p>“OH£, Ellendi!” he hailed Moylan. </p><p> The latter moved on without</p><p>turning. The pursuer's short legs </p><p>were put to their best to catch up the pas- </p><p>senger two hundred yards away from camp. </p><p> “What does this mean?" raged the cara-</p><p>van owner, in a rage not wholly made to </p><p>order, when at length he ranged alongside </p><p>his quarry. “Why do you earn- your lug- </p><p>gage when you stray? My men are honest. </p><p>I	am their master—I, Imbarak the Hon-</p><p>est.” </p><p> “Well,” laughed Kiel, glancing: about him</p><p>and then laying down his bundle in the </p><p>narrow camel track that links Damascus </p><p>with Bagdad, “what then, O Imbarak the </p><p>Honest? May I not do as I will with mine </p><p>own?” </p><p> “Your own?” scoffed Imbarak. “’Tis</p><p>the catchword of even- thief.” </p><p> “Thief?”</p><p> “No man pays triple passage money un-</p><p>less he is in flight,” summed up Imbarak; </p><p>“no man guards a bundle unless it be pre- </p><p>cious. You are a thief. You have stolen </p><p>that which is of value and puts the black </p><p>fear into your heart. You are in flight.” </p><p> “Well?” repeated Kiel amiably. “What</p><p>then, my little man?” </p><p> The calmness of the accused rudely shook</p><p>Imbarak’s convictions that he was a thief. </p><p>For do not thieves—Syrian thieves—on </p><p>accusation, ever beat their breasts and cry </p><p>aloud upon Allah to witness their inno- </p><p>cence? </p><p> Yet of one thing Imbarak was right cer-</p><p>tain—Kiel must have had some powerful </p><p>reason for leaving Damascus in haste, to </p><p>have made him pay so exorbitant a price. </p><p>And, whatever the reason might be, its very </p><p>existence sufficed Imbarak the Honest.</p><p> “When I took you as my passenger.” said</p><p>he, “I consented to a low fare, since you be- </p><p>sought me in the name of Allah the Merci- </p><p>ful and because you vowed you were poor. </p><p>Adventure </p><p>You are not poor. And you are a thief. </p><p>Therefore I will take you no step beyond </p><p>this.” </p><p> "No? Then I must walk back to Damas-</p><p>cus to await the next caravan, and mean- </p><p>time to lay information before the Cadi </p><p>against one Imbarak the Honest, who hath </p><p>robbed me of forty medjidie in passage- </p><p>money.” </p><p> “You dare not go before the Cadi. For I,</p><p>too, shall return, at your side, and 1 shall </p><p>tell why 1 refuse to let you bring ill fortune </p><p>to honest folk by remaining on the march </p><p>with us. On suspicion you will be searched </p><p>and-” </p><p> “Exactly. How much?”</p><p> Here was a man with a soul too gross for</p><p>the bliss of bargaining, and with a sigh of </p><p>jovs foregone, Imbarak the Honest replied </p><p>“Nine hundred medjidie.’' </p><p> “Oh, Offspring of the Gadarenes,” ob-</p><p>served Kiel, “if I possessed nine hundred </p><p>medjidie I would not be traveling with out- </p><p>casts upon lame and mange-stricken camels, </p><p>owned by a pickpocket of the bazaars.” </p><p> To be’ termed a pickpocket and to hear</p><p>his men referred to as outcasts was a mere </p><p>everv-dav pleasantry that ruffled Imbarak </p><p>the Honest not at all, but a slur on one’s </p><p>camels is as mortal an insult as is an affront </p><p>to one’s religicn. And at the expressions </p><p>“lame and mange-stricken” Imbarak figura- </p><p>tively and literally soared high in air, and </p><p>he came down bodily upon Kiel, ugly curved </p><p>belt-knife in fist. </p><p> Kiel took the assault as philosophically</p><p>as a move in a chess-game. It was, in fact, </p><p>a move he himself had prepared, and he </p><p>was quite ready for it. </p><p> Imbarak struck downward—a move in</p><p>Syrian knife-fighting that means merely a </p><p>wound or a scratch, as differentiated from </p><p>the gruesome up-thrust and its subsequent </p><p>wrench of the crooked blade. </p><p> Kiel neatly blocked the blow with his</p><p>bundle—which received thereby a mortal </p><p>wound in its vitals—and with his right fist </p><p>caught the Honest Imbarak flush on the </p><p>left point of the chin.	.</p><p> The caravan man was transformed into a</p><p>limp huddle of twitching clothes. </p><p> “He ou^ht to be good for at least live min-</p><p>utes,” mused Kiel, as he hurried cityward</p><p>along the camel track, “unless I’ve forgotten </p><p>how to put steam into a right lead. </p><p> A hundred yards farther on he stopped,</p><p>as a soft quadruple pad-pad-pad oi spongy </p><p> feet broke on his ear. Two camels, huge</p><p> in the gloom, rose ever larger, in his path.</p><p> “Raad!” called Moylan softly.</p><p> “It was well played, Howaji!” laughed the</p><p> negro as he made the led camel kneel to re-</p><p> ceive its new burden. “Yet it is worth my</p><p> commission if it be found out. Here are the</p><p> swathing-cloths. Wrap them as I taught</p><p> you, else you will be shaken to a jelly be-</p><p> fore the ten days be past. Now, mount and</p><p> ride. We can reach Bagdad and you can</p><p> leave it, full ten days ahead of the hue and</p><p> cry.”</p><p>Ill </p><p> MAIA GARTH had made it clear</p><p>—very painfully clear—that Kiel’s </p><p>venture in quest of the Shem-cs- </p><p>Nabi would mark the end of his acquaint- </p><p>ance with her. She had told him so, many </p><p>times and from different angles, that </p><p>August night when he left her at the door of </p><p>her apartment. She had expressly forbid- </p><p>den him to hold any further communication </p><p>with her on his return from the East. </p><p> For which excellent reasons, Moylan</p><p>went to the Garth apartment direct from </p><p>the ship. He arrived at a barbarously early </p><p>hour and had the good fortune to find her </p><p>at home and momentarily devoid of visible </p><p>relatives. It was not an average condition, </p><p>and he took hope. </p><p> She received him as if he had called</p><p> barely a day before, instead of after a lapse</p><p> of more than two months; nor did a shade</p><p> of expression show she noted how thin and</p><p> how brown he had grown, and that a queer</p><p> hunted look was still lurking at the back of</p><p> his eyes.</p><p>“Well?” was her cryptic greeting. </p><p>“I have it,” was his, as he drew forth the </p><p> Shcm-es-Nabi.</p><p> “So I see,” she answered, scarcely glu-</p><p> eing at it, “but you’ve forgotten some-</p><p> thing.”</p><p> “I—I don’t--t . c</p><p> “That I don’t care to number thie\es</p><p> among mv friends.”</p><p> “It isn't theft!” he burst forth. l tx-</p><p> don't want to discuss it.

She was enlardy her^lf</p><p> —cool, unruffled, pleasantly firm. &lt;-</p><p>no possible change of verdict in her cka </p><p> eves.</p><p>From the “Tip” of the Rocket </p><p>143 </p><p> ‘ As you like,” he said, feeling all at once</p><p> very sick and old. “I got this thing, and I</p><p> risked my life to get it. Then I dodged the</p><p> knife of a camel-man to keep it. Then I</p><p> made a ten-day trip that was a hospital-</p><p> furnace nightmare, fringed with two Bed-</p><p> ouin chases, a touch of sunstroke and a day</p><p> of sand blindness. I’ve spent every dollar</p><p> I had on earth—all for this measly relic, and</p><p> for what it meant to me. And now it—it</p><p> means nothing.”</p><p> “Nothing at all,” she assented sweetly.</p><p> “Good-by!” he muttered, trying to find</p><p> the door.</p><p> “It is good-by,” she agreed. “I’m sorry,</p><p> but it is.”</p><p> He paused, looked at the ring in his palm,</p><p> then again at her.</p><p> “You’ve made your choice,” she reminded</p><p> him, in an access of tact.</p><p> “Yes!” he growled. “I’ve made it. Just</p><p> this minute. If it weren’t for this tiling,</p><p>you’d let me-” </p><p> “Isn’t it too late to think of that?”</p><p> “No. I’ll—I’ll send it back.

A lot of them. </p><p>At night, you know." </p><p> And at last a gleam of intelligence dawned</p><p>in Moylan’s deadened brain. </p><p> “Rockets?” he babbled feebly. “Not the</p><p>night when we-?” </p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “But Judge Gregg-”</p><p> “Judge Gregg is still waiting impatiently</p><p>for a man he wants as a law partner.” </p><p>“Oh!” </p><p> “He is a dear,” pursued Maia enthusias-</p><p>tically. “I like him.

Then he visits a .Brooklyn wharf-saloon in answer to a second atlcr from</p><p>Dacy. He is shanghaied and awakes aboard the cargo steamer Ormsby, bound, according to Gi/vu/h Do- , </p><p>with supplies for a British man-of-war. Believing the story, McNitJ accepts the chief engineer';.

Dooin quickly convinces Mc.Xi. l that </p><p>Dacy and bis crew are playing some bigger game than mere contraband running.

And he shows the chief engineer that they mu?t work </p><p>together or they will go over the rail together, once Dacy has succeeded, since dead men’s tongues are s'-ilL </p><p>VIII </p><p>THE morning the Ormsby </p><p>/mJ J pounded her way to the east- </p><p>ward. After nine o’clock the </p><p>hERm w ire I ess was busy. I could hear </p><p>the crackle of the juice as it leaped through </p><p>the spark gap, even in the engine-room. </p><p>Once, when I had climbed the ladder for </p><p>a breath of fresh air, I saw the nimble Mr. </p><p>Todd dance up the bridge ladder with a dis- </p><p>patch in his hand. IS I r. Podd was evident- </p><p>ly in high spirits again. </p><p>Courtney was also abroad. He bobbed </p><p>out of the chart-house, grabbed the dis- </p><p>patch from Podd’s hand, and bobbed in </p><p>again. From these signs I concluded that </p><p>theOrw.v&amp;ywas approaching her destination. </p><p>The watch passed slowly. My thoughts </p><p>dwelt constantly upon the little man crouch- </p><p>ing in the life-boat, and upon the conversa- </p><p>tion I had had with him. What was the </p><p>game? Would Mr. Dooin’s vague fears </p><p>prove well-founded? Was the Ormsby other </p><p>than she seemed? </p><p> 144</p><p> I had no trouble with the men. In fact,</p><p> my evil-looking gang worked their heads off:</p><p> and if they didn't exactly look as if they</p><p> enjoyed it, they took good care that none</p><p> of their muttering reached my ears. But</p><p> there was a good deal of clandestine whis-</p><p> pering among them, and about them an air</p><p> of expectancy.</p><p> And when I was relieved and went on</p><p> deck at noon, I saw and felt the same ex-</p><p> pectancy and suppressed excitement in the</p><p> rest of the crew. The deck crowd no longer</p><p> sprawled about the forehatches: they stood</p><p> about in groups. Through the cabin door 1</p><p> saw Doctor Farley and Raider in close com-</p><p> munion. Upon the bridge Henderson stood</p><p> in earnest conversation with the man at the</p><p> wheel.</p><p> I clambered to the boat skids on the star-</p><p> board side, and got into communication</p><p> with Dooin. 1 saw that the canvas cover-</p><p> ing on the life-boat had been slit for a tew</p><p> inches near the stern. An air-hole! I leaned</p><p> carelessly across the gunwale, pretended to be</p><p> searching the sea and whispered to the rent.</p><p>Gold at Sea </p><p>145 </p><p> “Are you there? This is McNeil.”</p><p>“Yes,” came the answer. “What news?” </p><p>“There is something in the wind,” I an- </p><p>swered. “Everybody is excited. I think </p><p>we are coming up to our position.” </p><p>“Anything in sight?’’ </p><p> “No, not even a smoke trail. But the</p><p>wireless has been working all morning. The </p><p>messages are for Courtney.” </p><p> “Have you heard anything?”</p><p> “No, they fight shy of me. They stop</p><p>talking whenever I draw near.” </p><p> “Well, keep your eyes skinned. Mosey</p><p>around and maybe those sports will let you </p><p>hear or see something.” </p><p> I “moseyed” around. I went up on the</p><p>bridge and interrupted the tete-a-tete be- </p><p>tween Henderson and the man at the wheel. </p><p>They stopped talking as soon as I hove in </p><p>sight, but I knew that it was not because </p><p>Hot Scotch was abashed that I had discov- </p><p>ered him gossiping with a forecastle hand. </p><p>He met me with a smile. </p><p> “Well, Mac, how’s things below?” he</p><p>greeted. </p><p> “Well enough,” I replied. “What’s our</p><p>position?” </p><p> “I don’t know,” he lied; I knew he lied</p><p>because I had seen him and Dacy taking </p><p>the sun as I came off watch. </p><p> “Tell that to a marine,” I told him. “If</p><p>you don’t want to answer a civil question, </p><p>say so—don’t lie.” </p><p> “Don’t get sore, Mac,” he grinned. “I</p><p>got an awful poor memory for figures this</p><p>trip—I was advised to have.” </p><p> I stepped into the chart-house. Captain</p><p>Dacy was stretched upon the couch, read- </p><p>ing; Courtney was seated at the table, po- </p><p>ring over a dispatch, and consulting a little </p><p>book at his right hand; a code book, evi- </p><p>dently. </p><p> Hello, Chief!” exclaimed Dacy. “Did</p><p>you have any trouble with the watch this </p><p>morning?” </p><p> “No,” I told him. "You put the fear of</p><p>God?mto them. What is the position, Cap- </p><p>I Western Ocean,” he answered prompt- </p><p>yj 1 hirty-six hours from New York.” </p><p> Je smiled when he said it, but there was</p><p>tionbigin eyes tilat f°rbade further ques- </p><p>™ “?°?d morning, Mr. Courtney,” I re- </p><p>marked. “Still seasick?” </p><p>fac^0Urtney ^itec* a c^smal&gt; grcenish-hued </p><p>10 </p><p> “My word, yes. This beastly ship will</p><p>be the end of me, you know. I’ll never feel </p><p>like eating again.” </p><p> “Oh, not so bad as that,” I said easily.</p><p>“Wait till we come alongside your country- </p><p>man—you can go aboard her and dine with </p><p>comfort. Those big battle-wagons are as </p><p>steady as a church in this fine weather.” </p><p>“But she isn’t so big,” explained Court- </p><p>ney dismally. “From what I have heard, </p><p>you know, she’ll be worse than this ship. </p><p>She is only-” </p><p> “Oh, McNeil,” interrupted the captain,</p><p>“are your cargo-pumps ready? We shall </p><p>need them soon. I wish you would see that </p><p>they are gotten ready this afternoon. Set </p><p>Johnson to work upon them.” </p><p> The captain was no longer smiling. His</p><p>voice had just the hint of a savage edge. I </p><p>left. </p><p>BEFORE the cabin door I encoun- </p><p>tered the mysterious Mr. Podd. H e </p><p>hugged a book to his breast, and his </p><p>face was alight with some happy, dreamy </p><p>excitement. His shoulders twitched con- </p><p>vulsively. </p><p> “How are you, Mr. Podd. Have you</p><p>definitely decided upon your particular </p><p>French Red Devil?” I inquired. </p><p> “Oh, Mr. McMeal,” he answered hap-</p><p>pily, “I have discovered that one must </p><p>have family traditions. All of our best </p><p>people have family traditions, Mr. Mc- </p><p>Meal. This is ‘Hearts Entwined,’ by Robert </p><p>C. Bambers, the famous authority. He </p><p>states that a gentleman must have family </p><p>traditions.” </p><p> “Undoubtedly,” I agreed. “Do you an-</p><p>ticipate any difficulty in procuring your tra- </p><p>ditions? Just what sort of traditions do </p><p>you desire?” </p><p> “I never thought of that,” he answered</p><p>uncertainly. “But I shall acquire family </p><p>traditions,” he continued confidently. </p><p>“When I receive my share I shall get what- </p><p>ever is necessarv-—I shall be guided by Mr. </p><p>Bambers.” </p><p> “You are fortunate to have such an au-</p><p>thority to rely upon,” said I. “Not every </p><p>favorite author could do as much. What </p><p>will your share come to?” </p><p> “Not half as much as yours,” was the</p><p>unexpected reply. </p><p> “Do you think it will be enough for your</p><p>plans?” I asked, thinking of the thousand </p><p>dollars that had been promised me. </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Of course,” he replied, “it will be a</p><p>fortune. There are twelve-” </p><p> “Podd, you might be needed in the wire-</p><p>less-room!” came a level-voiced interrup- </p><p>tion. </p><p> 1 turned. Doctor Farley stood in the</p><p>cabin doorway, regarding Podd with a men- </p><p>acing glare. He said nothing more, but the </p><p>luckless Podd collapsed like a punctured </p><p>balloon. A look of deadly fear came into </p><p>his staring eyes, and he turned and dashed </p><p>for his station at top speed, </p><p> “Your dinner is ready, Mr. McNeil,”</p><p>said Farley. </p><p> I gulped over my astonishment and dis-</p><p>appointment. </p><p>“All right,” I answered. “I’ll be there in </p><p>a moment. I have to go below just now.” </p><p>In the engine-room I found Mr. Johnson, </p><p>alias Werner, already at work upon the car- </p><p>go-pumps. </p><p> “They are to be in working condition this</p><p>afternoon,” I stated. </p><p> liJa, I yoost overhaul dem,” he answered.</p><p>“By the way, Mr. Johnson,” I asked, </p><p>“have you figured out what your share will </p><p>come to? A neat sum, hey?” </p><p> He drew himself up stiffly, and his face</p><p>flushed. </p><p> “I nod work for dere dirty gold,” he said.</p><p>“I strike for der-” </p><p> He checked himself and regarded me re-</p><p>sentfully. </p><p> “Vait, you see!” And he turned to his</p><p>work. </p><p> I tried to prod him into another out-</p><p>burst, but without success. “Der pumps </p><p>vill be ready,” was all I could obtain from </p><p>him.</p><p> I returned to the deck and made my way</p><p>to Doom. </p><p> “Well, I’ve ‘moseyed’ around,” I whis-</p><p>pered to the hole in the canvas. </p><p> “Good sport!” came his voice. “What</p><p>did you discover?” </p><p> “The first mate is a clam—no news from</p><p>him. Captain Dacy, ditto. I tried to pump </p><p>Courtney, but Dacy interfered just as I was </p><p>about to learn something. I know one thing </p><p>—the British ship we are bound for is a </p><p>small ship, and we will raise her some time </p><p>today or tonight. </p><p> “But they are very secretive. I couldn’t</p><p>even discover the position of the ship.” </p><p>“Don’t you know where we are?” asked </p><p>Dooin. </p><p> “No idea of the latitude and longitude.</p><p>But, allowing for change of course, I figure </p><p>we are about three hundred miles east by </p><p>north of New York.” </p><p> “Umph,” grunted Dooin. “Kind of</p><p>vague if need arose and we were able to </p><p>send a wireless. Anything else? </p><p> I told him about Podd, the wireless man.</p><p>“I think he is crazy, but not too crazy," </p><p>1 said. “He's spending a fortune in his </p><p>mind, with the aid of a popular author. </p><p>The fortune is to be his share from this trip </p><p>—and he stated that I also shared in the </p><p>cut. Pretty soft for me, but I would like </p><p>to know more about it. Podd was scared </p><p>silly when Farley interrupted us—evident- </p><p>ly had no business talking to me. What do </p><p>you make of it; just a fair,- tale?” </p><p> “I don't know,” muttered Dooin. “Any-</p><p>thing else?” </p><p> “Yes. I asked myr German friend about</p><p>his share. He got insulted and told me he </p><p>did not work for their dirty gold. Said he </p><p>was striking for something or other.” </p><p> “Phew!” exclaimed Dooin. “Say, this</p><p>ship isn’t armed, is she?” </p><p> “No, I thought of that—privateering or</p><p>something like that. But the old tub is s.j </p><p>slow she couldn’t catch a brick-scow.” </p><p>“Well,” remarked Dooin, “we’ll just have </p><p>to await developments. Something is rot- </p><p>ten!” </p><p> We talked a little while longer, and he</p><p>asked me particularly about Podd. He was </p><p>interested in his mercurial spirits and nerv- </p><p>ous habits. </p><p> “He may be our man,” he commented</p><p>finally. </p><p> “How do you mean?”</p><p> “Well, every' chain has its weak link.</p><p>Look for the weak link.” With which an-</p><p>swer I had to content myself. </p><p> “I am going to snatch a bite to eat, and</p><p>then turn in,” I told him at last. "I need </p><p>sleep. I’ll try to have a word with you be- </p><p>fore 1 go on watch again. </p><p>HANY engineer is sensitive to engine </p><p>sounds. At sea, the rhythm of the </p><p>screw is ever present in his con- </p><p>sciousness, and waking or sleeping he is in- </p><p>stantly aware of any change in the move- </p><p>ment. </p><p> Hence, I awoke when the Ormsby slowed</p><p>clown. I lay idly for a moment, listening to </p><p>the crackle of the wireless; then through the </p><p>open port came the sound of Captain Dacy &gt; </p><p>voice shouting orders. </p><p>Gold at Sea </p><p>147 </p><p> I rolled out. With the Captain giving or-</p><p> ders, there must be something afoot. I had</p><p> turned in standing, so I was on deck imme-</p><p> diately.</p><p> One glance ahead showed me what the</p><p> hullabaloo was about. We had arrived. A</p><p> half-mile ahead, on the starboard bow, a</p><p> long, gray, three-funnel torpedo-boat de-</p><p> stroyer lay motionless on the smooth sea.</p><p> Captain Dacy was in active command</p><p> upon the bridge; Courtney, his sickness for-</p><p> gotten, danced excitedly in and out of the</p><p> chart house; Henderson and Raider drove</p><p> their watches about the decks with unac-</p><p> customed vigor; everything was being done</p><p> with snap and ginger. The strong hand</p><p> had taken hold.</p><p> I lost no time in clambering up beside the</p><p> life-boat.</p><p> “We have arrived!” I whispered, as I</p><p> leaned across the gunwale and examined</p><p> the craft we were approaching.</p><p> “What is it?” came Dooin’s answer.</p><p> “A torpedo-boat destroyer,” I said. “A</p><p> big one no flag, but of course she is the</p><p> Britisher. She’s a big oil-burner.”</p><p> “Any news?” he asked.</p><p> “No. We are getting ready to go along-</p><p> side her. Lines are out, and a gang is open-</p><p> ing the hatch to number one hold where</p><p> the stores are. Captain Dacy is on the</p><p> job.”</p><p> Captain Dacy proved he was on the job</p><p> by hailing me that very moment.</p><p> "Oh, McNeil, come here, will you?”</p><p> I made my way to the bridge, and Dacy</p><p> drew me aside in the wing and spoke confi-</p><p> dentially.</p><p> “McNeil will you go below and take</p><p> charge? 1hat Dutchman has just informed</p><p> me through the speaking-tube that the car-</p><p> ap^e-ed-We shai1 need them</p><p> sai7h“r ^ right tllis “orningI</p><p> otlrh :f.test?d them myself.

There was not</p><p> a ring of packing or a valve in place in either</p><p> pump; the bonnets were off and the nuts</p><p> scattered, the rods were lying upon the floor-</p><p> plates. The busy Mr. Johnson, in a few</p><p> hours of bungling, had caused damage that</p><p> would take most of the night to repair.</p><p> I was furious, and cursed him roundly.</p><p> He smiled philosophically and answered</p><p> nothing. I w’as so angry that I failed to re-</p><p> mark upon the strangeness of any engineer</p><p> doing such a thing. Then, my tongue hav-</p><p> ing eased my mind a bit, I started to work.</p><p> We were soon tied up to the man-o’-war;</p><p> Johnson was receiving bells from the bridge</p><p> even before I started to work. As soon as</p><p> the rattle of the deck winches apprised us</p><p> below that the stores were being transferred,</p><p> Johnson quietly disappeared, without even</p><p> offering to help me. I was quite content to</p><p> have turn go.</p><p> I pressed the watch into service, and af-</p><p> ter a fifteen-minute trial, during which they</p><p> deliberately undid all I accomplished, I</p><p> drove them away. Then I sweated and</p><p> swore and labored alone.</p><p> Captain Dacy came down, and with him</p><p> was a youngish man in the undress uniform</p><p> of an officer of the British Navy.</p><p> “This is Captain Montague, of the</p><p> Wasp,” said Dacy to me. “Captain Mon-</p><p> tague, this is my chief engineer.”</p><p> Captain Montague inclined his head in</p><p> my direction a frigid half-inch. In return I</p><p> gave him a nod that was as curt, and con-</p><p> tinued with my work.</p><p> “We have been working upon the pumps</p><p> ever since we left New York,” glibly ex-</p><p> plained Dacy, "We had hoped to have</p><p> them ready by the time we came up with</p><p> you, but there was too much to be done</p><p> upon them. But McNeil assures me that</p><p> they will be in operation before morning.”</p><p> "I should hope so. My word, they must</p><p> be!" exclaimed the Englishman.' “We</p><p> haven’t enough oil in our tanks to last us</p><p> two hours’ steaming, and we must be away</p><p> by morning.”</p><p> "I’ll have them running by midnight,” I</p><p> told him. "Two hours’ pumping will fill</p><p> you up.”</p><p> Captain Montague was much relieved,</p><p> and his face cleared.</p><p> "1 hat will do very well." said he. “I do</p><p>not care so long as I get my fuel by day- </p><p>light. It is safe enough to lay by you this </p><p>fair weather, and I will admit that all of us </p><p>14-8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>will relish a few consecutive hours’ sleep. </p><p>My ship is a poor place for rest when under </p><p>way. If you like, Mr. Engineer, I will send </p><p>over a couple of my artificers to lend you </p><p>a hand." </p><p> “No, thank you,” I answered hastily. “I</p><p>can make out very well alone.” </p><p> I had no desire to have a couple of super-</p><p>cilious navy men working at my elbow. The </p><p>Englishman did not press his offer, for </p><p>which I was grateful. </p><p> He and Dacy stood there talking for</p><p>some time; Dacy lying volubly, and pro- </p><p>testing that we had been laboring night and </p><p>day upon recalcitrant pumps since leaving </p><p>port. Dacy's readiness to lie to save his </p><p>face surprised me; 1 had not thought him </p><p>that kind of man. But it was none of my </p><p>business, and I kept my mouth shut. Fi- </p><p>nally they departed and left me alone. </p><p> I kept my promise to have the pumps in</p><p>running condition by midnight. Then, as- </p><p>certaining through the speaking-tube from </p><p>the bridge that everything at the other end </p><p>was in readiness, I started the oil into the </p><p>war-ship’s tanks. I set an oiler to watch the </p><p>pumps, and dirty, tired and hungry, climbed </p><p>to the deck. </p><p> I had intended to communicate with Doo-</p><p>in, but found no opportunity for doing so </p><p>immediately. Henderson met me at the </p><p>engine-room door and escorted me forward, </p><p>grown garrulous of a sudden, and regaling </p><p>me with an off-color story. </p><p> The destroyer was lying by our star-</p><p>board side, dark and quiet. Our own decks </p><p>were black, the stores evidently all trans- </p><p>ferred. I looked over the rail at the war- </p><p>ship; but beyond a few dim forms visible </p><p>on her bridge, her decks seemed deserted.</p><p>Henderson stuck at my side, and seeing no </p><p>chance to reach Dooin just then, I entered </p><p>the cabin. </p><p> Dacy, Farley and Podd were in the cabin.</p><p>Dacy greeted me effusively, complimented </p><p>me upon a task well done and offered me </p><p>the use of his own bath in which to clean </p><p>up. Farley smiled upon me ingratiatingly </p><p>and informed me that he had saved a hot </p><p>dinner for me. Podd grinned vacantly and </p><p>conveyed the impression that the sight of </p><p>me gave him unalloyed delight, Henderson </p><p>continued his reminiscences. It seemed as </p><p>if all were now cultivating me even as they </p><p>had before avoided me. </p><p> I was too dirty and hungry to take much</p><p>interest iu anything save a bath and sup- </p><p>per, for the time being. I enjoyed the cu{&gt;- </p><p>tain’s tub, and then sat down to the appe- </p><p>tizing mess the big negro, Turk, brought me </p><p>from the galley. </p><p> WHILE I ate, I became acutely con-</p><p>scious of the peculiar bearing of my </p><p>companions. Farley paced nervously </p><p>up and down the cabin; Henderson was </p><p>absurdly loquacious; Podd said nothing, but </p><p>sat tensely on the edge of a chair, his bulging </p><p>eyes glistening with excitement. Only IJucy </p><p>was calm, he sat with immobile face, a cigar- </p><p>stump clamped between his jaws. </p><p> From their demeanor, I gained the im-</p><p>pression that something was about to hap- </p><p>pen. What, I did not know, could not </p><p>guess. Who could have guessed the truth? </p><p>But my liveliest curiosity was aroused, and </p><p>in a measure I was placed upon my guard. </p><p> “Captain Montague was well pleased</p><p>when the pumps started," remarked Dacy. </p><p>“He has turned in with the rest of bis crew. </p><p>Poor chaps, they have a hard time at sea in </p><p>that class of ship.” </p><p> “I noticed her dc-cks darkened as I came</p><p>forward,” I responded. “Isn't Captain </p><p>Montague taking quite a chance—leaving </p><p>his vessel practically unguarded, at sea. and </p><p>in wartime?’’ </p><p> “No danger,” answered Dacy. “He has</p><p>posted an anchor watch, and all lights are </p><p>doused both upon the	and upon us.</p><p>His men could turn out at a moment s no- </p><p>tice.” </p><p> “She is a mighty long way from a safe</p><p>base,” I commented. “A destroyer doesn’t </p><p>usually operate alone, so far from a home </p><p>port.” </p><p> “The Wasp is one of a new type, said</p><p>Dacy. “She has a steaming radius of two </p><p>thousand eight hundred miles with oil fuel,</p><p>and a speed of thirty-six knots when driven. </p><p>She is from Halifax, and has been cruising </p><p>off New York for a couple of weeks. She is </p><p>better for commerce destroying than a </p><p>larger vessel.” </p><p> “Where is Courtney?” I asked.</p><p> Mr. Podd jumped nervously at the ques-</p><p>tion and glanced at Farley. </p><p> “Gone to bed,” said Farley.</p><p> “Where I am going directly,’ I answered.</p><p>“I am tired.”	„</p><p> “Have a nip of schnapps before you go,</p><p>said Dacy. ‘ Farley, there is a bottle upon </p><p>the sideboard.”	...</p><p> Farley stepped to the sideboard behind</p><p>Gold at Sea </p><p>149 </p><p>me. I noticed Todd watching him, mouth </p><p>agape. Aroused, 1 directed my eyes to the </p><p>mirror hanging on the wall in front of me. </p><p> In die mirror, I saw Farley pick up the</p><p>bottle and pour out the drink. Then he </p><p>cast a quick look at my back, drew a tiny </p><p>bottle from his breast-pocket and passed </p><p>his hands across the top of the glass intend- </p><p>ed for me. It was all done in a flash. </p><p> “Here you are, Chief,” said Farley.</p><p>“Prime Kentucky stuff—do you good!” </p><p> He handed the doctored glass to me. I</p><p>took it, stood up and looked him square in </p><p>the eye. Such was the man’s effrontery he </p><p>never blinked an eye, though he must have </p><p>known from my look that I knew what he </p><p>had done. </p><p> His aplomb touched the tinder to my</p><p>choler. I dashed the drink into his face </p><p>and took him by the throat. I thrust my </p><p>hand into his breast-pocket and whipped </p><p>out the phial. It was unlabeled, and the </p><p>contents a colorless liquid. </p><p> “You little crook!” I cried, shaking him.</p><p>“What do you mean by drugging my </p><p>drink?” </p><p> He struggled futilely, and I tightened my</p><p>clutch on his windpipe. Then he was tom </p><p>from my grasp, and I found myself strug- </p><p>gling desperately with Dacy and Hender- </p><p>son who had flung themselves upon me. </p><p> I downed Henderson with a blow on the</p><p>jaw, and wrestled furiously in the iron </p><p>grasp of Captain Dacy. He was a stronger </p><p>man even than I. </p><p> I heard rushing feet on the deck without,</p><p>in answer to his low, sharp cry. Men </p><p>swarmed into the cabin. I was seized from </p><p>behind and my arms pinioned. </p><p> It had happened so quickly—my anger</p><p>and its consequences—that I was dazed." I</p><p>made an effort to continue the struggle, and </p><p>found myself powerless to move. My arms </p><p>were twisted behind me, and strong, expert </p><p>hands clutched my wrists. </p><p>Don t disable him,” I heard Dacy say. </p><p> I subsided and twisted my head around.</p><p>Ihe cabin was filled; a half-dozen men had </p><p>answered Daev’s cry. Henderson was just </p><p>picking himself up from the floor, nursing </p><p>his jaw with both hands. </p><p> I stared at the men, and my jaw dropped.</p><p>I hey were my own crowd, men of the black </p><p>gang. My assistant, Johnson, led them, </p><p>an&lt;l in his hand he bore a naked sword. </p><p>About each man’s middle was strapped a </p><p>cart 1 idge belt and a brace of revolvers. </p><p> I stared, and there came to me a light-</p><p>ning comprehension of the stunning truth. </p><p>I opened my mouth to shout a warning, to </p><p>scream at the top of my voice a message </p><p>that Dooin in the life-boat. and mayhap the </p><p>ship beside us, would hear. </p><p> One of the men behind me crooked his</p><p>arm around my throat and choked my </p><p>speech. </p><p> “Gag him!” I heard Dacy exclaim.</p><p> My head wTas roughly drawn back. Into</p><p>my mouth was forced the gag—a piece of </p><p>cork wrapped with a napkin, I soon discov- </p><p>ered. The ends of the thing were drawn </p><p>tightly across my cheeks and knotted to- </p><p>gether at the back of my neck. I was help- </p><p>less; I could not utter a sound; for a few </p><p>moments I could hardly breathe. </p><p> A low'-voiced conversation was going on</p><p>behind me, in which I made out Dacy’s </p><p>voice but could overhear nothing. Then I </p><p>was roughly urged ahead by the men be- </p><p>hind me. </p><p> We traversed the cabin, the cabin alley-</p><p>way, and emerged on deck. I was choking, </p><p>and there was a buzzing in my head. I was </p><p>only half-conscious that numerous figures </p><p>surrounded me. I was shoved and dragged </p><p>across the deck to the side of the ship. </p><p> “Have you got them?” I heard a voice</p><p>cry softly. </p><p> “Yes, here they are!” came the answer in</p><p>Farley’s voice. </p><p> My arms were jerked from behind me</p><p>and forced around a stanchion in front of </p><p>me. I felt the touch of cold steel upon my </p><p>wrists, and heard a click. My captors un- </p><p>handed me and stepped away. </p><p> Instinctively, I jerked my arms apart.</p><p>They came some three inches. I was hand- </p><p>cuffed to the stanchion! </p><p> “Pleasant thoughts, Mr. McNeil!” came</p><p>Farley’s level, venomous voice in my ear. </p><p> Then I heard retreating footsteps.</p><p>IX </p><p>I WAS helpless. The stanchion I </p><p>was shackled to was one of the </p><p>bridge supports—an iron “I,” fully </p><p>ten inches wide. By twisting my head, I </p><p>could see for some distance along the </p><p>Ormsby's deck, both fore and aft; and by </p><p>twisting my body and stretching my neck, </p><p>I could also peer around the edge of the </p><p>stanchion and down upon the destroyer’s </p><p>decks. </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The gag l»urt me cruelly. I tried, but un-</p><p> successfully, to reach my head around the</p><p> stanchion so that my jaws and lingers would</p><p> meet. I bit and chewed frantically upon</p><p> the cork, in my mouth, and only succeeded</p><p> in giving myself pain. 1 was panic-stricken</p><p> at the thought of the deed about to happen,</p><p> and of my utter inability to warn the sleep-</p><p> ing ship that lay before me.</p><p> Then ! became still and waited with hor-</p><p> ror and despair for the thing to happen.</p><p> Stealthy footsteps passed and repassed</p><p> behind me. It was a dark night, bright</p><p> with stars, but moonless. Not a light was</p><p> showing upon either ship. The Ormsby's</p><p> bulk, towering above the Wasp, threw the</p><p> latter’s decks into black shadow. But, by</p><p> twisting my head, I could make out many</p><p> dim, moving shapes upon our own decks.</p><p> Dacy’s whole hell-crew was stirring.</p><p> From the bridge of the Wasp came the</p><p> sound of the bell. Four bells—two o’clock!</p><p> From the destroyer's forecastle came the</p><p> gruff, subdued hail, “Four bells, and all-1’s</p><p> well!” and from the bridge, the boyish</p><p> treble of the midshipman’s response, “All’s</p><p> well!”</p><p> I heard Dacy’s voice behind me.</p><p> “We must strike now! McNeil said two</p><p> hours’ pumping would fill her up. 1 he time</p><p>is up.” •	,</p><p> “We are ready for’rd,” came Henderson s</p><p> voice.</p><p> “All ready aft,” from Raider.</p><p> “Werner!” called Dacy softly; the Ger-</p><p> man emerged from the gloom. “Take your</p><p> gang and get to work upon the engines,</p><p> directed Dacy.</p><p> The group moved away forward. Di-</p><p> rectly, a group of men crept aft. As they</p><p> passed me I saw that they bore coils of</p><p> rope and Jacob’s ladders. They strung</p><p> along the rail—dim blots in the night.</p><p> I heard Dacy’s guarded voice again.</p><p> “Remember, light up at the sound of the</p><p> whistle!”</p><p> “Avc, aye, sir,” was the murmured re-</p><p> sponse.	‘	.</p><p> Three men climbed the Ormsby s rail and</p><p> descended to the destroyer’s decks. They</p><p> made no effort at concealment, and clumped</p><p> over the Wasp's steel decks.</p><p> “Who’s there?” came the midshipmans</p><p> hail.	,, tT</p><p> “Camc to look at your tanks, came Hen-</p><p> derson’s voice. “They must be about</p><p> full.”</p><p> “All right,” was the answer. “I'll go</p><p> with you.”</p><p> The Wasp's officer—lie was but a mid-</p><p> shipman and a boy, I afterward knew—</p><p> joined Henderson and the other two. I hey</p><p> strode to the engine-room hatch and disap-</p><p> peared below.</p><p> What happened next has been the sub-</p><p> ject of much foolish comment in the public</p><p> press. But then, a war-ship pirated and her</p><p> crew subdued by half their number of cut-</p><p> throats! Small wonder that being ignorant</p><p> of details the press should wax sarcastic</p><p> and the public skeptical. It seems to be-</p><p> long to another century—to Sir Henry Mor-</p><p> gan and the Spanish Main.</p><p> But indeed, Roger Dacy was, himself, a</p><p> very Morgan of a man; and the crew who</p><p> followed him aboard the Wasp was fully as</p><p> evil and desperate a gang as ever boarded</p><p> a galleon in the olden days.</p><p> Because the Governments concerned have</p><p> maintained silence, a grave injustice has</p><p> been done Captain Montague and his men.</p><p> The truth is, they never had a chance.</p><p> As soon as the" engine-room hatch closed</p><p> over the heads of Henderson, the middy and</p><p> the other two men, Dacy and his crew com-</p><p> menced.</p><p> Fore and aft. along the Ormsby s rail, the</p><p> ropes and the ladders were softly lowered</p><p> over the side. Men swarmed down them to</p><p> the Wasjys deck. It was done so silently</p><p> and swiftlv that I. watching and expecting,</p><p> could but' dimly perceive the maneuver m</p><p> the darkness. The men of the U asp’s an-</p><p> chor-watch, off their guard and unsuspect-</p><p> ing of treachc-rv, were not aroused. In a</p><p> moment the Wasp's decks were filled with</p><p> swiftlv moving shapes.</p><p> “ 'Oo’s there?” came from the destroyer s</p><p> bridge. “’Ey? My God— Ah-h-h!” I he</p><p> voice trailed away in a choking gurgle.</p><p> A chorus of veils, answered by spitting</p><p> flames and the* crash of revolver shots, a</p><p> scream, and then a shrill whistle sounded.</p><p> Instantly* the Wasp's decks were bathed</p><p> in bright 'light along their entire length.</p><p> The Onnsbv’s searchlight was trained upon</p><p> the Wasp's after quarter. The Wasp s own</p><p> two searchlights lighted the amidship sec-</p><p> tion and the forecastle.</p><p> What happened, happened so quietly</p><p> that I could hardly grasp it. When the</p><p> lights went on. the destroyer s decks were</p><p> crowded with ihe Ormsby's men. A group</p><p> were engaged in clamping shut the door to</p><p>Gold at Sea </p><p>the crew’s quarters, forward, and some of </p><p>them were shooting through the port-holes </p><p>at the helpless men inside. Other groups </p><p>were disappearing down the fire-room and </p><p>engine-room hatches. A third gang, among </p><p>whom was Dacy, tumbled down the after </p><p>hatch that opened to the officers’ quarters. </p><p> Pandemonium! From the forecastle came</p><p>the yells of the imprisoned men, answered </p><p>by revolver shots. From the engine-room </p><p>came cries and shots, and the long-drawn </p><p>shriek of a man going out in agony. From </p><p>the after hatch, down which Dacy had gone, </p><p>came more shots and shouts. </p><p> Out of that after hatch came a pajama-</p><p>clad figure—the unfortunate Captain Mon- </p><p>tague. He carried a dispatch-box in his </p><p>arms, and ran toward the side of the ship. </p><p>He was wounded and staggered as he ran. </p><p> A streak of flame burst from the yawning</p><p>hatch. Montague dropped the box, threw </p><p>up his hands and fell forward upon his face. </p><p>Out of the hatch leaped Farley, smoking re- </p><p>volver in hand. He ran to Montague’s side </p><p>and pounced upon the dispatch-box. </p><p> The uproar ceased as abruptly as it com-</p><p>menced, save that the men in the forecastle </p><p>still howled, and the gang without still shot </p><p>into the port-holes that opened aft. </p><p> Out of the cabin hatch came two pajama-</p><p>clad figures, guarded by revolver-armed </p><p>men. Then came Dacy, and following him </p><p>four men who carried two limp bodies. The </p><p>four staggered to the side with their ghast- </p><p>ly burdens and threw them into the sea. </p><p> A gang commenced to collect the bodies</p><p>scattered about the deck—the bodies of </p><p>Montague, and of the anchor-watch. I </p><p>gazed horror-struck. I counted twelve </p><p>splashes as the sea received the murdered </p><p>dead. Out of the engine-room came more </p><p>men, prisoners and guards, and men carry- </p><p>ing limp burdens which they gave to the </p><p>sea. I counted twelve splashes, and was </p><p>sure there were more.</p><p> Dacy gave some orders. The Ormsby’s</p><p>searchlight was switched from the Wasp's </p><p>after deck to the Ormsby's foredeck. A </p><p>gang of men, under Raider’s command, re- </p><p>boarded the Ormsby. They went to the </p><p>lorehatch and removed a section of the cov- </p><p>ering Then, with drawn weapons, they </p><p>stretched along the rail. </p><p> Then commenced the transference of the</p><p>prisoners. The pa jama-clad officers, and </p><p>the men taken in the engine and fire-rooms, </p><p>were made to climb the ladder to the Orms- </p><p>by’s deck. They were forced to descend into </p><p>the forehold. When they had disappeared, </p><p>the hatch section was replaced and Raider s </p><p>crowd stood guard. </p><p> On board the Wasp a parley took place</p><p>between Dacy and the men imprisoned </p><p>within the forecastle compartment. The </p><p>forecastle door opened a scant ways, it </p><p>swung outward, and three of the Wasp’s </p><p>men squeezed through. The door was slam- </p><p>med and fastened behind them. </p><p> The three were compelled to board the</p><p>Ormsby and descend into the forehold, after </p><p>the same manner as their shipmates. Safe- </p><p>ly in the hold, and the hatch replaced over </p><p>their heads, the word was passed to the </p><p>crowd upon the Wasp. The forecastle door </p><p>was opened again, three more men emerged, </p><p>and the whole process was repeated. </p><p> In this manner the Wasp's crew was</p><p>transferred. Fifty-one men came out of </p><p>that forecastle, in groups of three. They </p><p>had no chance to resist. They were sur- </p><p>rounded by armed men from the instant </p><p>they reached the Wasp's deck until the}' </p><p>were safely belowr in the Ormsby's forehold. </p><p>pPM SUCH was the taking of the TT‘&lt;*sp. </p><p> Poor Montague has been charged</p><p>with carelessness, and his men with </p><p>cowardice. Neither charge is true. The </p><p>men w’ere given no chance to organize re- </p><p>sistance; they were completely surprised. </p><p>And how could Montague have suspected </p><p>danger from the rusty old supply ship </p><p>brought to his side by a representative of </p><p>his own Government? </p><p> The Wasp had been three weeks at sea.</p><p>To one who knows nothing of torpedo-boats </p><p>or destroyers, this may not appear signifi- </p><p>cant. It really means that for twenty-one </p><p>days the men on the ir&lt;z5/&gt; had been sub- </p><p>sisting upon pick-up lunches and contenting </p><p>themselves with cat-naps of rest. Those </p><p>over-engined shells are nerve-racking, tiring </p><p>places to live in at sea. </p><p> The Wasp's complement had been de-</p><p>pleted through the dispatch of prize crews. </p><p>When she sighted the Ormsby that after- </p><p>noon, she had but seventy-three officers and </p><p>men aboard. They had been standing </p><p>watch and watch for weeks, and all hands </p><p>were tired out. In merely posting an an- </p><p>chor-w’atch, and allowing the rest of his </p><p>crew to obtain a night's sleep, Montague </p><p>did what any officer with his men’s well- </p><p>being and comfort at heart would have done. </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Nor would it have made much difference</p><p> had a full watch been on duty. Dacy’s</p><p> crowd would have still outnumbered them,</p><p> and the surprise would have been just as</p><p> complete. It might have cost Dacy a few</p><p> more lives, but he cared nothing for that.</p><p> As it was, he lost just one man—slain by</p><p> Montague as the latter leaped from his bed</p><p> during the invasion of the cabin.</p><p> The Wasp's build laid her open to just</p><p> such an attack. There are no deck-houses</p><p> or other obstructions on a destroyer’s decks.</p><p> Abaft the bridge, on the Wasp, only the</p><p> three funnels and the square hatches broke</p><p> the llush decks.</p><p> The forecastle was high, and broke at the</p><p> beam. Beneath the forecastle head the en-</p><p> tire crew berthed. There was but the one</p><p> door. The rest of the ship was compart-</p><p> ments. A destroyer is just a box of com-</p><p> partments. There was no communication</p><p> between them save through the little square</p><p> hatches in the deck. There were no doors</p><p> below decks—just sheer steel bulkheads, iso-</p><p> lating each section.</p><p> Dacy knew destroyers. He knew how</p><p>the Wasp was constructed. He knew that </p><p>with the steel door to the forecastle closed, </p><p>the major portion of the crew would be im- </p><p>prisoned. He knew he had then only to </p><p>reckon with the few men in the isolated fire- </p><p>rooms, the men in the engine-room, and the </p><p>few officers in the cabin. The capture of </p><p>the Wasp was planned beforehand down to </p><p>the least detail, and the plot was daringly </p><p>and ruthlessly executed. </p><p>fZSA THROUGHOUT it all I stood at </p><p>/fig, the Ormsby's rail, handcuffed to the </p><p>stanchion, a horrified and fascinated </p><p>witness to the scene. The audacity of the </p><p>act was stunning; the butchery that accom- </p><p>panied it nauseating. </p><p> I am not a squeamish person; I have seen</p><p> many men go out, with boots on and with</p><p> boots off. I, myself, have sent a couple</p><p> across the line—but in fair fight, and for</p><p> good cause. The heartless, cold-blooded</p><p> thoroughness with which Dacy knifed and</p><p> pistoled his way to victory sickened and en-</p><p> raged me. I struggled with my bonds, and</p><p> bit impotently upon my gag.</p><p> My eyes were riveted upon the Wasp,</p><p>but my thoughts would fly to the lile-boat </p><p>upon the skids above my head. Dooin! </p><p>Where was Dooin? Why did he not do </p><p>something? And then a glimmer of cold </p><p>reason would touch me. Dooin! What </p><p>could he do? Doubtless the little secret </p><p>agent was crouching overhead, as unwilling </p><p>a spectator as I to the scene, and as power- </p><p>less to intervene. </p><p> The Wasp's men were all safely herded</p><p>into the forehold of the Ormsby, and Cap- </p><p>tain Dacy ’s voice sounded from Lhe destroy- </p><p>er’s deck in crisp orders. The gang tlew to </p><p>obey. A number of them rushed below Lo </p><p>the U\;s/&gt;’s engine-room and lire-rooms, and </p><p>soon 1 heard the hum and the roar as the </p><p>oil fires were increased beneath the boilers. </p><p> •‘Get that Englishman in the chart-house</p><p>and chuck him into the hold!” came from </p><p>the Wasp's deck. </p><p> Some of Raider’s men left the foredeck</p><p>and came aft, climbed to the chart-house, 1 </p><p>and reappeared Jugging an unconscious j </p><p>body. They carried him forward, and as I </p><p>they moved into the glare of the searchlight j </p><p>I saw that they carried Courtney’s inani- </p><p>mate form. Poor Courtney, he had par- | </p><p>taken of Farley’s mixture, no doubt! </p><p> They carried him to the forehatch &lt;nd</p><p>lowered him into the hold. Then the hatch 1 </p><p>section was replaced for the last time, a , </p><p>heavy tarpaulin was drawn over the hatch j </p><p>and the battens were placed and hammered j </p><p>down. </p><p> “Werner!” came Dacy's hail from the j</p><p> Immediately came the Germans reply j</p><p>from the Ormsby's engine-room door. </p><p> “7j, here! I vas ready!"</p><p> “Then come aboard here and prepare to j</p><p>get under way!” </p><p> “/a. I leave vun man to smash der dy- j</p><p>name!” </p><p> Johnson, or rather. Werner, slid down to</p><p>the Wasp’s deck. He spoke with Dacy for j </p><p>a moment, and then disappeared into the _ </p><p>Wasp’s engine-room. </p><p> “Get the boxes with the uniforms!” or- ;</p><p>dered Dacy. </p><p> From the Ormsbv's forecastle were handed 1</p><p>two big packing-boxes. They were hoisted </p><p>to the rail and lowered to the H asp s deck, fl </p><p>where they were seized and whisked away - </p><p>into the latter’s forecastle.</p><p> “Bring McNeil aboard!	^</p><p> Men approached me. Farley s voice I</p><p>spoke in my ear.	. , j</p><p> “Well, McNeil, I hope you enjoyed the ;</p><p>entertainment!” </p><p> The handcuffs that bound me to the stan-</p><p>chion were unlocked and removed, and my </p><p>Gold at Sea </p><p>153 </p><p>numbed arms fell to my sides. With a gun </p><p>tickling my ribs, I was forced to clamber </p><p>the rail, and slide, rather than climb, down </p><p>a Jacob’s ladder to the Wasp's deck. I was </p><p>urged across the deck to the cabin hatch. </p><p> Presently I found myself between decks</p><p>in the lighted passageway of the officers’ </p><p>quarters. It was a fore-and-aft passage </p><p>with doors opening on either side. I caught </p><p>just a glimpse of a vista of disordered rooms, </p><p>and of a great, ugly, black splotch on the </p><p>carpet underfoot. One of my guards flung </p><p>open a door, I was thrown into one of the </p><p>rooms and the door was slammed and locked </p><p>behind me. </p><p>X </p><p>I UNKNOTTED the napkins and </p><p>removed the gag from my mouth. </p><p>I spat the cork out thankfully, and </p><p>looked about for water. My throat was </p><p>raw and my tongue swollen. </p><p> There was a desk before me, with a water-</p><p>bottle upon it. It was empty. I searched, </p><p>and in the bottom drawer of the desk I dis- </p><p>covered a siphon of soda and a bottle of </p><p>whisky. </p><p> I guzzled the soda, and it brought relief</p><p>to my tortured mouth. I also took a stiff </p><p>jolt of the liquor. </p><p> I was in an officer’s berth. The bunk</p><p>was in wild disorder, and trailing blankets </p><p>and overturned chairs gave evidence of a </p><p>recent struggle. But there were no blood- </p><p>stains about, and I decided that the room </p><p>had belonged to one of the pajama-ciad </p><p>men now imprisoned on board the Ormsby. </p><p>I set aright one of the chairs, fell into it </p><p>and tried to think. </p><p> Before my eyes flashed the scene 1 had</p><p>just witnessed—the attack, the surprise, </p><p>the slaughter, and the stream of prisoners </p><p>descending into the forehold. Piracy! </p><p>Bloody piracy! What did it mean? The </p><p>great war furnished a pregnant and obtru- </p><p>sive background to the picture. Was it pi- </p><p>racy? There was Werner! Was it all part </p><p>of a carefully planned German plot? </p><p> I looked at my watch — four - thirty,</p><p>three hours and a half had elapsed since</p><p>1' arley attempted to drug me in the Orms- </p><p>oy j cabin. It seemed an age. </p><p> I could not think clearly. I heard the</p><p>clumping of heavy feet upon the steel plates </p><p>over my head, and I reflected dully that </p><p>daylight must be breaking. But I had not </p><p>energy enough to turn my head to the port- </p><p>hole. Physical weariness, mental reaction, </p><p>and the soporific effect of the whisky I had </p><p>drank, all weighed upon me. I stumbled to </p><p>my feet, threw myself upon the crumpled </p><p>bunk and was asleep instantly. </p><p> I slept hours, though it seemed but a mo-</p><p>ment until I opened my eyes, refreshed. </p><p>The Wasp was under way. The vibration, </p><p>omnipresent upon such craft, brought a </p><p>rhythmic tremor from even,- plate and beam </p><p>and rivet. The glow of sunlight diffused </p><p>through the room whenever the port-hole </p><p>lifted above the racing waters. </p><p> I rolled out and tried the door. Locked!</p><p>I was still a prisoner. I looked at my watch. </p><p>Nine-thirty! I had slept a full five hours. </p><p> I sat dowrn in the chair and again re-</p><p>viewed the events of the past night. But </p><p>though I brought a freshened brain to the </p><p>task, and though my plight was pressing I </p><p>could find no answer to the riddle. A </p><p>twentieth-century piracy? Nonsensical! </p><p>A German plot? There was but one Ger- </p><p>man in the crowd, and he a subordi- </p><p>nate! </p><p> But I realized now what my value was</p><p>to Dacy and his crowd. I understood now </p><p>his queries as to my mechanical ability, and </p><p>his pleasure in discovering that I was fa- </p><p>miliar with torpedo-boat engines. </p><p> I was in the hands of a desperate gang</p><p>who held human life cheaply—the night </p><p>had given gruesome proof of that. There </p><p>was no bright spot in the gloom of the situa- </p><p>tion. I did not doubt that they would snuff </p><p>me out in an instant if I opposed them. I </p><p>must go easy; I must pretend to fall in with </p><p>their wishes; I must not lose my temper. </p><p>My life depended upon it. </p><p> If Dooin were only at my side! I had</p><p>faith that the little detective would And </p><p>means to rip the bloody net that I was </p><p>meshed in. </p><p> But where was Dooin? On board the</p><p>Ormsby, if alive—perhaps his bod)' too, </p><p>swirled in the depths! The Ormsby.’ Where </p><p>was the Ormsby now? </p><p> My gloomy meditations were abruptly</p><p>terminated by the rat tling of the door-knob. </p><p>The lock clicked and the door opened. </p><p> A sailor, wearing the blouse of a British</p><p>Navy bluejacket, and with a cutlass and </p><p>revolver belted about his waist, confronted </p><p>me. He spoke and 1 recognized him—it </p><p>was Worden. He stared at me with a ma- </p><p>levolent eye, but saluted with perfect grav- </p><p>ity and spoke meekly. </p><p>154 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Captain Dacy would like to see you, sir.</p><p> I am to take you to him.”</p><p> 1 followed him into the passageway. As</p><p> I traveled the length of the passage, I saw</p><p> that it bisected the officers’ quarters. The</p><p> berths were to starboard, the wardroom and</p><p> pantry to port. The ladder to the deck</p><p> was at the forward end of the passage.</p><p> Worden led me up the ladder to the deck.</p><p> I paused for a moment and swept the sea</p><p> with a wide-circling gaze. Not a sail or a</p><p> smoke-smudge in sight, or any sign of the</p><p> Ormsby! The Wasp was alone on the sea,</p><p> dashing northward, I judged by the sun,</p><p> and at a good twenty-five knots. The sea</p><p> was calm, yet the lift was such that I could</p><p> hardly keep my balance; and the plates</p><p> under my feet trembled like aspens from</p><p> the vibration of the engines.</p><p> We went forward and mounted to the lit-</p><p> tle bridge the Wasp sported. Worden mo-</p><p> tioned for me to enter the tiny chart-</p><p> room.</p><p> DACY was seated at a table, an</p><p> open dispatch-box at his elbow, por-</p><p> ing over a queer-looking book—a</p><p> book with sheets of lead for covers. This</p><p> was the prize that the wounded Captain</p><p> Montague had endeavored to give to the</p><p> sea just before Farley killed him.</p><p> In the corner of the room was a second</p><p> table, and upon it the wireless apparatus.</p><p> Podd was seated there, also bent over a</p><p> book—his beloved Bambers, I had no</p><p> doubt. He lifted a lugubrious countenance</p><p> as I appeared, got to his feet and departed,</p><p> giving me a blank stare as he passed.</p><p> Dacy looked up. Gone were the pleasant</p><p> smile and amiable manners. This was an-</p><p> other Dacyf, the true Dacy. His face was</p><p> stern, his cold, inscrutable eyes drilled into</p><p> me. He was the forceful leader I had sensed</p><p> him to be from the first.</p><p> “Well, McNeil,” he said, “I suppose you</p><p> wish to know what all this means?”</p><p> “Yes,” I answered. “What does it</p><p>mean?”	.</p><p> “It means that you arc embarked in the</p><p> greatest adventure of the century! There</p><p> is money in it—big money!</p><p> “It is bloody piracy!” I exclaimed.</p><p> “If you will be reasonable, McNeil, you</p><p> will be rolling in wealth within a week. If</p><p> you are not reasonable—but we will not</p><p> speak of that. I am sure you will be rea-</p><p> sonable. Nineteen men went over the side</p><p> last night. I would not like to add to the</p><p> number.’’</p><p> The threat was not lost upon me. So</p><p> nineteen men had died the night before!</p><p> “What do you want of me?” I demanded.</p><p> “I want you to be my chief engineer—a</p><p> job of a different caliber from the one you</p><p> had upon the Ormsby.”</p><p> “I want nothing to do with it!" I cried.</p><p> “I do not care to hang!”</p><p> "You have no choice,” he said gravely.</p><p> “If we hang, you hang. When they learn</p><p> of this affair ashore, you will be mentioned</p><p> as one of the leaders.”</p><p> “What!” I exclaimed. “I one of your</p><p> gang? Why, I wras shanghaied!”</p><p> “I will be frank with you, McNeil. You</p><p> are implicated as deeply as any of us. Your</p><p> name was forged upon the Ormsby's arti-</p><p> cles, and—do you recall that when you</p><p> came to yourself upon the Ormsby you re-</p><p> marked upon the odor of alcohol on your</p><p> bunk and upon your clothes?</p><p> “Yes,” I said, startled. “Why?”</p><p> “We poured whisky upon you for a pur-</p><p> pose. Before we left New York we were in-</p><p> spected by Lieutenant Haun of the revenue</p><p> cutter Beaver — ah, you know him;' And</p><p> you were shown to him stretched out in the</p><p> bunk apparently sleeping off a drunk. He</p><p> mentioned vour evil character to me!”</p><p> The devils! They had deliberately placed</p><p> me in a false light before a man who hated</p><p> me—an influential man who would cheer-</p><p> fully take oath as to my desperate charac-</p><p> ter. Lieutenant Haun of the Beaver was</p><p> the man I had tricked when the Coboy w^as</p><p> wrecked, as Haffner well knew. Haun</p><p> would enjoy the task of defaming me.</p><p> I used some very hard language.</p><p> “Easy!” the captain admonished. ‘Words</p><p> will not alter facts—you must face it! ’</p><p> “Yes,” I agreed sullenly. “I guess you</p><p> have me cornered. What have you done</p><p>with the Ormsby?” </p><p> “She is behind us somewhere, he an-</p><p> swered. “We turned her adrift with this</p><p> ship’s crew battened down in the forehold.</p><p> “How long do you think they will stay</p><p> there?” I asked. “There are determined</p><p> men and good mechanics in that crowd.</p><p> “They can do nothing,” he replied. \V e</p><p> smashed the dynamo and dismantled the</p><p> wireless, and put the engines out o com-</p><p> mission. They can do nothing dnft</p><p> about until picked up-and that will not be</p><p> until too late to interfere with us.</p><p>Gold at Sea </p><p>I55 </p><p> But a warm ray of hope shot through me</p><p>at his words. With the Ormsby above </p><p>w'ater, Dooin was alive! With an agent of </p><p>the Department of Justice to attest my </p><p>story, I need not much fear any net of cir- </p><p>cumstantial evidence that might be drawn </p><p>about me. With Dooin behind me, there </p><p>was small danger of my being branded as </p><p>one of these gallows-birds. But I showed </p><p>none of my elation to Dacy. </p><p> “Well,” I said, “what is your game, and</p><p>what do I get out of it?” </p><p> “Now, that is sensible of you to take it</p><p>in that spirit,” he replied. “You are to </p><p>take charge of the Wasp’s engine-room; and </p><p>your share of the expedition will amount to </p><p>about two hundred thousand dollars.” </p><p>“Huh! Fine promises!” I retorted. “You </p><p>must be flying high for a newly born pirate!” </p><p>“This is no scoffing matter,” he frowned. </p><p>“You realize that it has been serious enough, </p><p>so far. We are taking a big chance for a </p><p>big prize. We are after gold amounting to </p><p>twelve millions of dollars. We are going </p><p>to get it!” </p><p> I slowly digested this astounding state-</p><p>ment. </p><p> “Where is it?” I demanded; somehow, I</p><p>knew he was speaking the truth. </p><p> “You will know that in due time,” w’as</p><p>his response. </p><p> “But, good Goa, man!” I cried. “This is</p><p>madness! These are not Captain Kidd's </p><p>days—this is the twentieth century! You </p><p>can't pull off a piracy nowadays and get </p><p>away with it. They’ll scour the world for </p><p>you!” </p><p> “We have already accomplished the most</p><p>difficult p&gt;art of the enterprise,” he said eas- </p><p>ily. "The gold is waiting for us, and our </p><p>getaway is already arranged for.” </p><p> ^ ou seem to be verv sure of vo</p><p>I suggested. </p><p>We are already in communication with </p><p>er by wireless. She is waiting for us to </p><p>convoy her—the fly waiting for the spider!” </p><p>e chuckled as if the joke were good. “Do </p><p>vou see this, McNeil?” He patted the book </p><p>with the lead covers. “This is the secret </p><p>code book of the British Nav)-a rare jewel </p><p>r some people we could mention, hey?</p><p>^l°ntague gave his life in a vain </p><p>to save * ^om us.

They were the key </p><p>to his character—remorseless, ruthless, un- </p><p>moral. I knew he wTould remove me, if he </p><p>thought it necessary, with as little com- </p><p>punction as he would show to an insect </p><p>that crossed his path. </p><p> “Well, I'll run your engines,” I said,</p><p>“but I do it under protest. I'll join in the </p><p>killing of no innocent person for the sake </p><p>of goid.” </p><p> “I don’t care what you do it under so</p><p>long as you do it,” he said. “You will still </p><p>have Werner for your assistant. He is a </p><p>good man, but without much practical ex- </p><p>perience. Keep the engines running, and </p><p>you w’ill not be expected to assist us in any </p><p>other way.” </p><p> ~~jjj WHEN I left the chart-room, I</p><p> found that the freedom of the ship</p><p> —	was mine. I had half expected the</p><p>gentle Worden to attach himself to me as a </p><p>permanent escort; but apparently no watch </p><p>was set upon my movements. </p><p> Raider had the watch, but he gave me</p><p>no other attention than a black look. I re- </p><p>turned it with interest. </p><p> I ranged about the decks to obtain a full</p><p>view of the ship. The U'u5/&gt; was one of </p><p>the large cruising type of destroyers, de- </p><p>veloped by naval constructors during the </p><p>past half-dozen years. I had noticed a </p><p>brass plate on the chart-room bulkhead that </p><p>show’ed her to be less than a year in com- </p><p>mission. She was about two thousand tons </p><p>displacement. </p><p> Her batten' consisted of four torpedo-</p><p>tubes, two aft and two forward, and six </p><p>rapid-fire guns of the standard British 4.7 </p><p>type, arranged three to a side. </p><p> A group of four men were working upon</p><p>one of the guns, and they worked as if they </p><p>understood their business. They were be- </p><p>ing bossed by the navy deserter I had no- </p><p>ticed at the wheel of the Ormsby—the man</p><p>with the gunner’s mate’s rating upon liis </p><p>sleeve.	’</p><p> “Evidently,” 1 thought, “Dacy has or-</p><p>ganized his crew’ upon a man-o’-war basis </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and rated petty officers.” A true guess, I </p><p>soon discovered. The gang had left their </p><p>carefree, work-be-danined manner upon the </p><p>Ormsby; prompt, unquestioning obedience </p><p>to orders was the rule upon the Wasp. </p><p> I looked about the deck for evidences of</p><p> the previous night’s fury; but the decks had</p><p> been cleaned, and there were no traces of</p><p> the fight. Finally, I dropped through the</p><p> engine-room hatch, and presently found my-</p><p> self at the bottom of the engine-room lad-</p><p> der, gazing about me with satisfied ap-</p><p>proval.	#</p><p> I do not think any engineer could have</p><p> stilled a glow of contentment upon survey-</p><p> ing the Wasp's engine-room. It was a vi-</p><p> sion of cleanliness and order, of bright steel</p><p> and gleaming brass. The big casings that</p><p> enclosed the turbines were clean and glis-</p><p> tening; a couple of oilers scurried about,</p><p> alive to their work; the mingled odor of hot</p><p> oil and grease and working steel met my</p><p> nostrils pleasantly.</p><p> Mr. Johnson stood erect between the</p><p>twin throttles, and as I crossed to him he </p><p>greeted me with a smile. </p><p> “Goot morning, Chief!” His mild blue</p><p>eye twinkled. “I hope you got der pumps </p><p>fixed.” </p><p> “Say!” I exclaimed, of a sudden thought.</p><p> “Did you dismantle those pumps purposely,</p><p> yesterday afternoon?”</p><p> “/a,”’he admitted easily. “It vas or-</p><p> ders.”</p><p> I saw another clever move in the plot.</p><p> The dismantling of the Ormsby's pumps had</p><p> kept the Wasp beside the other ship, and</p><p> also had kept me from witnessing or inter-</p><p> fering with any of the preparations for the</p><p> attack.</p><p> “Well, Mr. Johnson,” I said, “I suppose,</p><p> like the rest of the crowd, you are hugely</p><p> pleased with last night's exploit.”</p><p> “Nod Johnson, Mr. McNeil! I vas Lieu-</p><p> tenant Ludwig von Werner, vunce of der</p><p> Imperial German Navy!” He took on a</p><p> certain dignity of manner as he spoke. “I</p><p> like nod to live under der false name, und</p><p> der need for it has passed.”</p><p> “Very well, Mr. Lieutenant Ludwig von</p><p> Werner,” I answered. “You certainly have</p><p> a right to call yourself whatever pleases</p><p> you. But I should think that an alias would</p><p> be best for any man mixed up in this bloody</p><p> mCSS!	, ,	r „</p><p> “I vas nod ashamed of my. name I vas</p><p> a gentleman!”</p><p> “A gentleman’s code does not include</p><p>murder and barratry,” I snorted contempt- </p><p>uously" “You are guilty of both.” </p><p> “Vat care I?” he cried with sudden heat.</p><p> His figure stiffened, and his mild eye blazed</p><p> with an almost maniacal light. “I strike</p><p> for der Vatcrland! Der English vas mine</p><p> enemies—dey vas der enemies of mine peo-</p><p> ple! Vat care I for dead men—I care nod</p><p> if dey all were dead. Me—I strike for der</p><p> Vatcrlandr</p><p> “Fine sentiments,” I taunted. “But I</p><p>dare say you will take your share of the </p><p>gold this crow’d is after.” </p><p> His face grew red. I thought for an in-</p><p> stant he would attempt to strike me.</p><p> “You insult me! You make me vun of</p><p>dese.” He waved his hand scornfully to in- </p><p>clude the whole ship. “I care nod—your </p><p>words vas wrong. Yes, I help dem ged der </p><p>gold! It is for der Vatcrland I do it—it vas </p><p>British gold!” </p><p> “Where is the gold?” I asked.</p><p> “If you nod know, I tell you nodding,”</p><p> he answered with a return to his accustomed</p><p> phlegm. “You vas trying to pump me</p><p> —I say no more. Yen will you relieve</p><p> me?”</p><p> “Soon,” I told him curtly.</p><p> I left the German and took a trip about</p><p> the engines. She was a sweet sight for a</p><p> discriminating eye—two big turbines for</p><p> going ahead and' a third, and smaller ^-et,</p><p> for going astern. I saw the reason now for</p><p> Dacy’s interest in turbines. Everything</p><p> was new and spick and span. I made the</p><p> mental resolve that as long as I was com-</p><p> pelled- to take charge of the department,</p><p> the men would toe the mark and keep the</p><p> beauties in their present condition.</p><p> I mounted to the deck and descended</p><p>into the different fire-rooms. There were </p><p>six of them, one for each boiler. In each I </p><p>encountered the same things—the boiler </p><p>steaming, the oil fires carefully tended, </p><p>three men alert and competent in the per- </p><p>formance of their duties. No need now to </p><p>wonder why the Ormsby was overmanned! </p><p> At last I returned to the officers quar-</p><p> ters, and my room, as I already thought of</p><p> the room in which I had been imprisoned.</p><p> 1	was still clad in the grimy clothes I had</p><p> labored in the night before. I searched for</p><p> and found some clean dungarees, and don-</p><p> ned them.	.	«</p><p> As I left the room again, and stepped</p><p> into the passageway, the door of the room</p><p>Gold at vSea </p><p>157 </p><p>next to mine opened and Mr. Podd stepped </p><p>forth. </p><p> We were face to face, but Podd looked at</p><p> me with unseeing eyes. When I had seen</p><p> him in the chart-room, a short time before,</p><p> his face had borne the look of one who was</p><p> suffering acutely. Now, the deep lines were</p><p> smoothed from his haggard face; his eyes</p><p> w'ere alight, a fixed smile was upon his bps,</p><p> and he gazed straight at me and was un-</p><p> conscious of my presence. He seemed to</p><p> be in a happy trance. I gave him “good-</p><p> morning/’ but he stalked silently to the lad-</p><p> der and disappeared out on deck.</p><p> When he had gone I noticed Farley stand-</p><p> ing in the ward-room entrance, evidently</p><p> drawn there by the sound of my voice. He</p><p> regarded me with a smile that was akin to a</p><p> sneer, and gave me a hail, meant to be jo-</p><p> vial perhaps, which rasped my nerves.</p><p> “Ha, McNeil!” he cried. ' “Would you</p><p>like a little nip of schnapps?” </p><p> I jumped to his side. I felt that some of</p><p> the steam bottled up inside of me must</p><p> blow off. I reached out and took him bv</p><p> the throat.	J</p><p> “You little rat,” I grated, “I’ve a good</p><p> nnnd to wring your neck!”</p><p> I meant no more than to frighten him,</p><p>but some of my rancor and panic crept into </p><p>my finger-tips as I squeezed. He struggled </p><p>wildly, and a fearful look crept into his </p><p>bulging eyes. I released my grip, and he </p><p>sank gaspmg to the floor. </p><p> “It would serve you right if I killed you</p><p> you dirty murderer!” I told him. “Get out</p><p> of my sight!”</p><p> f icv\v°=e t0rrhiS f?Ct’ nursinS his neck.

I sensed keenly upon</p><p> what a slender thread my safety hung.</p><p> I felt fear for Dooin. I had given the</p><p>little man my friendship and liking, and the </p><p>thought of his probable condition was not </p><p>cheering. True, Dacy had said the Ormsby </p><p>was afloat, and Dooin was on the Ormsby. </p><p>But had Dacy spoken truth? I put nothing </p><p>beyond Dacy and his gang. Mayhap the </p><p>Ormsby was scuttled, and Dooin’and the </p><p>men in the forehold now food for fishes! It </p><p>would have been the safer course for Dacy. </p><p> And with Dooin gone, what of my own</p><p>position? If I ever regained shore safely, </p><p>what predicament would I find myself in? </p><p>Proscribed for murder and piracjr! </p><p> For Dacy had so arranged that I would</p><p>be regarded as one of the gang. Perhaps, </p><p>in New York, I was already being called </p><p>pirate and murderer. My reputation with </p><p>the powers that be was none too sweet; I </p><p>was a well-known filibuster. My wild tale </p><p>would gain no credence. I would not have </p><p>believed it from another man, myself. </p><p> I was not so much afraid of death; I had</p><p> faced it often, and had been long enough at</p><p> sea to be something of a fatalist. But the</p><p> contemplation of the gallows as a means oi</p><p> making my exit was disheartening.</p><p> The wireless was talking overhead, crack-</p><p> ling and humming. Dac\' was talking to</p><p> some one over the rim of the sea—talking</p><p> to the prize, no doubt.</p><p> The prize! What was the prize? The</p><p>swiftly turning shafts sang it to me, “twelve </p><p>million, twelve million, twelve million!” </p><p>Twelve million dollars—an unbelievable </p><p>sum. What ship would carry such treasure? </p><p>^et, I knew some ship did and that the </p><p> II	asp was coursing in her direction.</p><p> Dacy was talking to her with the aid of</p><p> the British Navy’s secret code-book that</p><p> poor Montague had tried to sink in the sea.</p><p> She must be a British ship.</p><p> British gold! Before my mind’s eve</p><p>came a picture of a West Street dock, and </p><p>of a huge motor-truck with a covered load </p><p>and four armed men perched atop. </p><p> ‘‘By heavens!” I cried. “It’s the Maure-</p><p> subia!"</p><p> The M.auresub/al- It was three days now</p><p> since I had stood before the dock gates on</p><p>Adventure </p><p>West Street. She was preparing for sea </p><p>then. She was loading treasure. It must </p><p>be the Maurcsubia.</p><p> But the stunning audacity of it! The</p><p>Maurcsubia was a thirty-thousand-ton grey- </p><p>hound. To hold her up and loot her was </p><p>impossible—unthinkable. Vet, such must </p><p>be Dacy’s plan. </p><p> Thinking about the Maurcsubia and West</p><p>Street, it was perhaps but natural that my </p><p>thoughts should wander a bit. At any </p><p>rate, natural or not, they did. I forgot the </p><p>Maurcsubia, the Wasp, and Dooin and </p><p>Dacy. Forgot I was the quasi-prisoner of </p><p>a murderous band of thugs. </p><p> Three days! Had but three days passed</p><p>since I stood upon West Street and talked </p><p>to her—since I had seen her living face and </p><p>heard her voice? Was it three days since I </p><p>had met Mary Morrison? It seemed an age. </p><p> Yes, I, Donald McNeil, bucko engineer</p><p>and woman-hater, stood for Heaven knows </p><p>how long, staring blankly at a piece of pol- </p><p>ished metal, my hands caressing a withered </p><p>flower I had taken from my bosom, my </p><p>thoughts mooning mistily about a lady fair, </p><p>just like one of those driveling, sentimental </p><p>idiots you read about in books. </p><p> And* I found this occupation exceedingly</p><p>pleasant. So engrossed was I that I lost </p><p>all track of the time. The first intimation I </p><p>had that the hour for changing the watch </p><p>had arrived, was when Von Werner ap- </p><p>peared at my elbow. </p><p> Even then, I was not at first conscious of</p><p>his presence. I was endeavoring to settle </p><p>what appeared at the instant to be a mo- </p><p>mentous question—in what cheek did that </p><p>adorable dimple belong? The answer was </p><p>most elusive. Then I had it. </p><p> “Her right check, I’ll bet my boots!” I</p><p>ejaculated. </p><p> Then it was that a grunt of surprise</p><p>brought me to my senses, and I turned to </p><p>discover Von Werner at my elbow. He </p><p>was regarding me with mild amusement. </p><p> “Dey vas so pleasant dreams you baf,”</p><p>he commented. “I speak dree times und </p><p>you never awake. You grin with joy der </p><p>while.” </p><p> I returned his salutation grumpily. I felt</p><p>somewhat sheepish to have been remarked </p><p>in such a pastime, even though the German </p><p>cculd have no inkling of my thoughts. I </p><p>turned the watch over to him and started </p><p>up the ladder. </p><p> “Der captain vants to see you, Cruet.</p><p>he called to me. “He vas waiting in der </p><p>ward-room for you. He say for you to come </p><p>to him.” </p><p>EtStI WAS late afternoon, and when</p><p>I entered the ward-room the giant, </p><p>Turk, was laying the table for sup- </p><p>per. Dacy was seated at the end of the </p><p>table, and Farley stood at his side talking </p><p>to him. </p><p> At my entrance, the negro vanished</p><p>through the door in the after wall that led </p><p>to the pantry. Farley hesitated an instant, </p><p>then followed Turk, favoring me with a ma- </p><p>lignant glare through his glasses as he passed </p><p>me. I was alone with the captain. </p><p> “McNeil,” he said abruptly, “I under-</p><p>stand that you assaulted the doctor this </p><p>morning. I gather you attempted to wring </p><p>his neck.” </p><p> “He brought it upon himself," I an-</p><p>swered. “He knew no better than to taunt </p><p>a raw-tempered man. He asked me to drink </p><p>some schnapps.” </p><p> “McNeil, do you fully realize your posi-</p><p>tion?” </p><p> “What do you mean?” I asked.</p><p> “I mean that you are acting foolishly.</p><p>Whether you will or no, you are one of us. </p><p>Why not play the game? What sense is </p><p>there in antagonizing your shipmates?” </p><p> “They are no shipmates of mine!’ I</p><p>flashed. “I am glad if I have convinced </p><p>them of the fact.” </p><p> “You have,” he said grimly. “There are</p><p>a dozen men on the ship who would delight </p><p>to bun- steel in you. Your hazing has given </p><p>you ill favor. .And you have made an enemy </p><p>of Farley.” </p><p> “Are you warning me that mv life is in</p><p>danger?” I asked. </p><p> “No. While I command, your life is safe,</p><p>so long as you obey my orders. But if you </p><p>are detected in any overt act against my </p><p>authority, you will be eliminated. And do </p><p>not make the mistake of thinking that any </p><p>hostile move on your part will not be </p><p>noted.” </p><p> “Well, you are the upper dog.’ I saia.</p><p> “Come, come, McNeil,” he laughed.</p><p>“Do not allow your resentment to sour </p><p>your disposition. Look at this matter dis- </p><p>passionately.” </p><p> “Look at it from your angle?” I suggested</p><p>with sarcasm. </p><p> “Yes. You might as well have the game</p><p>as the name, McNeil. Be sensible and join </p><p>Gold at Sea. </p><p>159 </p><p>us and share in the loot. It means a for- </p><p>tune for you.” </p><p> “And the gallows,” I added.</p><p> “It probably will mean the gallows if you</p><p>do not cast with us,” he replied. “But we </p><p>are not worrying about the gallow-s. The </p><p>disposal of the prize and our own getaway </p><p>is already arranged for, as I have told you. </p><p>We have friends in high places ashore. We </p><p>will be taken care of. Think of the prize!” </p><p>“Yes, I am thinking of it,” I said. “I </p><p>am wondering how many more lives this </p><p>mad business is going to cost. Your prize </p><p>is the Mauresubia, is it not?” </p><p> “So you have guessed that?” he laughed.</p><p>“Yes, it is the Mauresubia. It will do no </p><p>harm to let you know' that now\” </p><p> “Man, are you crazy?” I burst out. “The</p><p>Mauresubia is one of the largest ships afloat. </p><p>She’ll have over a thousand men in her </p><p>crew! How can you expect to get gold out </p><p>of her?” </p><p> “Easily,” he answ'ered. “That is the easi-</p><p>est part of the whole thing—the taking of </p><p>the gold away from the Mauresubia. I </p><p>doubt if a drop of blood be spilt. If that </p><p>is all that worries you, McNeil, 3'ou may </p><p>set your mind at rest. We will get the gold. </p><p>Come, give me your word to join whole- </p><p>heartedly with us. Remember there is a </p><p>fortune for you in it!” </p><p> A fortune in it! Yes, I remembered. I</p><p>thought of the things I could do with a for- </p><p>tune. With a fortune, even dreams might </p><p>come true. </p><p> Nor had I any doubt but that the gang</p><p>had their escape carefully planned, nor that </p><p>they would not probably make it. Oh, I </p><p>thought of it, and I was tempted. And </p><p>then I thought of the still figures I had seen </p><p>huddled on the decks the night before, and </p><p>thencallous burial in the sea. Cold-blood- </p><p>ed killings, for the sake of gold! I thought </p><p>ot the other killings that would probably </p><p>gold1 WhCn lllG effort was mafle to get the </p><p>.„lNo!” 1 exploded. “I’ll join freely in no </p><p>l-iii 1 ^arne as y°u are running.

He had been fingering </p><p>it during the conversation—a trinket of </p><p>gold, I noticed. Suddenly he addressed me </p><p>again, his pleasant, confidential manner </p><p>gone, his voice icy sharp.</p><p> “Remember, McNeil, your first move</p><p>against me will be your last move!” </p><p> He recommenced his toying with the</p><p>trinket. He looked at it, and of a sudden </p><p>his face lost its harshness, and became won- </p><p>drously soft. I stared at him with amaze- </p><p>ment. </p><p> He looked up.</p><p> “McNeil, why are you iooking at me in</p><p>that fashion?” he demanded. “Am I a </p><p>ghost?” </p><p> “Why,” I stammered, “you look like—</p><p>you resemble some one,” I faltered. Who </p><p>the devil did he resemble? </p><p> He smiled with a sudden return of his</p><p>good humor. </p><p> “I’ve noticed that queer stare from you</p><p>several times,” he said. </p><p> He was about to add more, when a sud-</p><p>den uproar in the pantry at our backs dis- </p><p>tracted our attention. </p><p> “Oh, Lawdy! Oh, Lawdy!” came the ter-</p><p>rified accents of the negro's voice. </p><p> The door of the pantry burst open, and</p><p>Turk tumbled into the room. His shiny </p><p>face was contorted with fright. </p><p> “Oh, Lawdy, oh, Lawdy!” he gasped.</p><p>“Dey’s a ghost in de storeroom! It's one o’ </p><p>dem we killed! Dey’s a spirut in de store- </p><p>room!” </p><p> “Captain, Captain!” came Farley's voice.</p><p>“Here, quick—a stowaway!” </p><p> Dacy leaped to his feet and dashed</p><p>through the pantry door. I was about to </p><p>follow, when I noticed upon the floor the </p><p>trinket Dacy had been playing with. He </p><p>had dropped it in liis haste. I stooped to </p><p>pick it up. to save it from damage. </p><p> I straightened up and stood as one petri-</p><p>fied. The trinket was a miniature portrait, </p><p>a girl’s face set in a gold frame. </p><p> It was the face of my dreams that smiled</p><p>up at me from the picture. It was the face </p><p>of Mary Morrison! </p><p> I stared at the miniature. I was too sur-</p><p>prised for the instant to even wonder at its </p><p>presence upon the	The sight of that</p><p>picture made me dimly realize for the first </p><p>time just how large a portion of my thoughts </p><p>that beautiful face had occupied during the </p><p>hurly-burly of the past three days. </p><p>i6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Then came distraction in the shape of a</p><p> voice from the pantry, raised in accents of</p><p> earnest pleading.</p><p> “Ow, Guvnarh, don’t kill me! S’help</p><p>me, I ain’t done nothing! Ow, Guvnarh,</p><p>don’t kill me!” </p><p> Hardly conscious of the act, I dropped</p><p> the miniature into my pocket. Then I</p><p> turned to face the procession that emerged</p><p> from the pantry.</p><p> Farley came first, and behind him was</p><p> Dacy. holding by the scruff of the neck a</p><p> squirming, pleading figure. The captive</p><p> was dressed in the white uniform of the</p><p> British Navy, and he was thickly coated</p><p> with Hour. A ghostly appearing figure, true</p><p> enough. Turk, crouching in the corner,</p><p> gave a grunt of terror.</p><p> ••Oh, Lawd, de spirut!”</p><p> Dacy gave his prisoner a shove that</p><p>bounced him the length of the table, and </p><p>then stood regarding him sternly. I caught </p><p>my first glimpse of the fellow’s face, and </p><p>almost cried aloud. </p><p> It was Dooin!</p><p>XI </p><p>IT WAS Dooin—or his twin. </p><p> He cringed before Dacy in a funk.</p><p> Clouds of flour dusted off his clothes.</p><p> When he spoke, it was not with Dooin’s</p><p> jaunty, American crispness, but in the bar-</p><p> barous Cockney accents of West India Dock</p><p> Road. It was Dooin’s body, right enough,</p><p> but the man was a stranger.</p><p> “Who are you?” demanded Dacy.</p><p> “Ow, don't kill me, Guvnarh!” pleaded</p><p> the fellow. “Hi ain’t done nothink to you,</p><p> Guvnarh!”</p><p> “Who are you?” interjected Farley.</p><p> “Captain’s man, sir,” was the answer.</p><p> “Hi was captain’s man sir, an’ doing stew-</p><p> ard’s duty, sir.”</p><p> “He is Montague’s valet,” said Farley to</p><p>Dacy. </p><p> “Yes sir,” affirmed the prisoner eagerly.</p><p> “Hi was captain Montague’s man, sir.”</p><p> “How did you get into that storeroom?”</p><p> demanded Dacy.</p><p> “Hi ’id there,” was the nervous reply.</p><p> “Hi was doing steward’s duty, sir. When</p><p> the fighting cyme, Hi run in the storeroom</p><p> an’ ’id in the flour-bin.”	....</p><p> The little man recounted his inglorious</p><p> retreat with great earnestness. I tried to</p><p> catch his eye, but his attention was all for</p><p> Dacy.</p><p> “Hi didn’t do nothink against you, Guv-</p><p>narh!” he repeated. </p><p> I decided it could not be Dooin—merely</p><p>a remarkable resemblance of face. </p><p> Turk advanced from his corner and in-</p><p>spected the little fellow critically. Turk's </p><p>fear was quite dissipated now he was as-</p><p>sured the ghostly figure was human. </p><p> “Sho!” he declaimed disgustedly. “Is</p><p>dat what it am? DatliTrunt? Lawdy—he </p><p>done looked eight feet high when he bobbed </p><p>outa dat flour-box, all white like dat.” </p><p> “Well, what shall we do with him?” re-</p><p>marked Dacy to Farley. “Over the side?” </p><p> “It might be well,” assented Farley.</p><p> “Ow, Guvnarh!” was the piteous plea. “I</p><p>didn’t do nothink to you, sir. In my bunk, </p><p>Hi was, Guvnarh, plyin’ ‘ ’Earts o’ Hoak' </p><p>on a mouth-horgan. When the fight cyme, </p><p>Hi ’id. Hi didn’t 'urt any of your blokes, </p><p>Guvnarh!” </p><p> He regarded Dacy anxiously. Dacy’s</p><p>face was stern. </p><p> “Hi’m a prisoner o’ war, Guvnarh. Hi</p><p>surrender. We don’t kill you blokes when </p><p>we captures them. Guvnarh.’ </p><p> A glimmering of the situation seemed to</p><p>strike him suddenly. </p><p> “Blimme—you chaps ain’t Germans:" he</p><p>cried. </p><p> “Never mind about that,' said Dacy.</p><p>“What is your name?” </p><p> “Harchibald Dooin, sir,” was the reply.</p><p> The words struck me like a blow. I</p><p>stared at him over Dacy’s shoulder, and </p><p>seemed to get just the flutter of an eyelid. </p><p> “We might make use of him,” remarked</p><p>Farley. “Turk has too much work to do, </p><p>and this man is a servant. Let him help </p><p>the nigger.”	.</p><p> “Yes sir—Hi’m a good steward, sir. eag-</p><p>erly proclaimed the prisoner. </p><p> “Very well,” assented Dacy. He shot a</p><p>terrifying glance at the cringing figure. </p><p>“But remember—if you make one crooked </p><p>move, over the side you go. Under- </p><p>stand?” </p><p> “Yes sir; ’kew sir; Hi understand. Hi m</p><p>a prisoner o’ war, working for my keep. Hi </p><p>won’t do nothink against you blokes, Gawd </p><p>strike me pink!” the little Cockney asserted </p><p>solemnly. </p><p> Dacy laughed.	,</p><p> “All right, Turk, take him along wUH</p><p>you,” he addressed the negro. “Make him </p><p>dean himself before you put him to work. </p><p> Turk reached out and graspea Doom</p><p>Gold at Sea </p><p>161 </p><p>lirmly by the arm, and the two disappeared </p><p>through the pantry door. </p><p>AND so, when Henderson present- </p><p>ly joined us, and we all sat down to </p><p>the meal, it was Dooin who deftly </p><p>waited upon the board; a strange Dooin,</p><p>with -a timid manner and the outward ap- </p><p>pearance of a British seaman. </p><p> “ ’Ere you are, sir. ’Arve a bit o’ this,</p><p>sir. ’Kew, sir.” This was the extent of his </p><p>speech throughout the meal. </p><p> He flew between the galley and the pan-</p><p>try, and the pantry and the table, in his </p><p>eagerness to make a good impression. He </p><p>waited upon us like a man bred to the job. </p><p> Several times I caught his eye, but not a</p><p>glimmer of recognition could I discern there. </p><p>If it was a disguise, it was wonderful—a </p><p>change of character, not of feature. Mr. </p><p>“Harchibald” Dooin had me guessing. </p><p> After the meal, I went below to the en-</p><p>gine-room and relieved Von Werner for a </p><p>couple of hours. A busy two hours they </p><p>proved, for the Wasp's speed had been in- </p><p>creased to thirty knots, and the engines </p><p>compelled my whole attention. </p><p> When I returned to the ward-room, the</p><p>table had been cleared of the dinner debris. </p><p>Dooin was nowhere in sight. Save for Podd, </p><p>the room was deserted. </p><p> Podd slouched upon the divan in the cor-</p><p>ner head on breast, brooding deeply. </p><p>“Hello,” I said. “All alone?” </p><p> He looked up, and I was shocked by the</p><p>expression on his face. It was an expres- </p><p>sion of hopeless despair, and his face was </p><p>furrowed with deep lines of suffering. He </p><p>looked utterly wretched </p><p> “What is the matter?” I asked.</p><p> He shook his head dejectedly.</p><p> McNeil, he said^ “did you ever have a</p><p>million maggots feasting upon your brain? </p><p>Did every atom of your being ever writhe </p><p>with desire?” </p><p> I was too surprised by his strange words</p><p>to answer. He suddenly leaped to his feet. </p><p>( It you had ever felt it,” he continued, </p><p> you would know what hell is like.”</p><p> He stood staring at me for an instant, his</p><p> &lt;?&gt;7°rkin- ,lis shoulders twitching.</p><p> My God! My God!” he muttered in some</p><p>inward agony. </p><p> Abruptly, he brushed past me and strode</p><p>Jroni the room. Then I heard the door of </p><p>his room across the passage slam shut be- </p><p>hind him. </p><p>11 </p><p> But I had small thought to waste upon</p><p>Mr. Podd’s vagaries. I waited a short time, </p><p>hoping for the appearance of the new stew- </p><p>ard, and then went to my own room. I </p><p>looked about the room for a message, and </p><p>found none. I threw myself into a chair, </p><p>stumped.</p><p> It was Dooin—surely it was Dooin! It</p><p>was merely a disguise, the speech and the </p><p>clothes. But how had he reached the Wasp? </p><p>Where did he get the clothes? Why had he </p><p>not recognized me and at least tipped me a </p><p>wink? No, it was no disguise, it was too </p><p>perfect. But the name and the face! </p><p> So ran my mind. I happened to thrust</p><p>my hand into my coat-pocket. I felt some- </p><p>thing hard and round, and I drew out the </p><p>miniature. </p><p> I had forgotten about the picture, but</p><p>now as I regarded it my thoughts changed </p><p>their direction abruptly. I gazed upon </p><p>that dainty, smiling resemblance, and my </p><p>troubles faded from my consciousness. I </p><p>was alone with Mary Morrison. </p><p> Her picture! How like, and yet how un-</p><p>like the beautiful, living face I remembered </p><p>so well. Yes, even in this portrait a laugh </p><p>seemed to tremble on the smiling lips, and </p><p>the eyes seemed fathomless. </p><p> Her picture! How came her picture into</p><p>Dacy’s hands—he a black-hearted criminal </p><p>with murder on his head. Surely, the West </p><p>Street girl had nothing to do with him. </p><p> Yet the expression on his face when he</p><p>had looked upon the portrait had been an </p><p>avowal that he knew her, and knew her </p><p>dearly. What was she to him? What busi- </p><p>ness was it of mine? </p><p> I brought myself up with a jerk as I real-</p><p>ized that I was subjecting to a jealous scru- </p><p>tiny the probable acts of a young woman I </p><p>did not know'. And then, staring at the </p><p>face, I recommenced my mooning. </p><p> “Hist!” came from seemingly over my</p><p>shoulder. </p><p> I jumped and whirled about. The room</p><p>was empty. </p><p> “Hist!” came from above my head.</p><p> I stared about me, bewildered.</p><p> “Up here, McNeil, up here,” came in soft</p><p>accents. </p><p> My eyes searched for the voice. Over-*</p><p>head, through the room, ran an air-duct, </p><p>part of the ventilating system of the ship. </p><p>It was of heavy, galvanized iron, about four- </p><p>teen by eighteen inches in size, and it was </p><p>affixed to the ceiling with iron bracec. A </p><p>Adventure </p><p>small, round offshoot from the parent pipe, </p><p>some eight inches in diameter, afforded fresh </p><p>air for the room 1 was in. </p><p> It was from this offshoot, as from a pho-</p><p>nograph-horn, that the mysterious voice </p><p>came. </p><p> I stepped close and brought my face on a</p><p>level with the ventilator opening. Through </p><p>the small pipe I could dimly see the bulk of </p><p>a human body lying in the duct. </p><p> “Hello,” I said. “I'm here.”</p><p> “Good sport!” was the answer. “This is</p><p>Dooin.” </p><p> “Dooin!” I exclaimed. “Then, confound</p><p>you, you’re not a Cockney!” </p><p> “Guess I kind of got your goat,” came</p><p>through the pipe. “Couldn’t help it—I </p><p>didn’t dare recognize you.” </p><p> “How did you get into that pipe?” I</p><p>asked. </p><p> “It runs past my bunk,” he informed me.</p><p>“There is an opening there, where it joins </p><p>the pipe that runs along the other side of </p><p>the ship. 1 crawled through and made my </p><p>way along until I saw you. I didn’t dare </p><p>try to see you openly.” </p><p> We commenced a series of questions and</p><p>answers. I recounted all that had hap- </p><p>pened to me since I had last spoken w7ilh </p><p>him, the day before. He told me of his own </p><p>movements. </p><p> “I waited for you to come and see me</p><p>last night,” he said. “After they had trans- </p><p>ferred the stores, they turned out all the </p><p>lights. 1 crawled out of the life-boat and </p><p>hid in the shadow beneath it. I saw them </p><p>moving around the decks, but I didn’t </p><p>dream of the job they were up to. In fact, </p><p>I had come to the conclusion that every- </p><p>thing was aboveboard. 1 reasoned that if </p><p>those jaspers were going to pull off any </p><p>crooked stunts it would be after the de- </p><p>parture of the war-ship.” </p><p> Then he told how he had heard Dacy’s</p><p>call for help during my struggle in the </p><p>Ormsby's cabin, and had seen them bring </p><p>me out and shackle me to the stanchion. </p><p>But in the darkness he could not distin- </p><p>guish features, and since I had been unable </p><p>to make any noise, he had not known what </p><p>occurred. The attack on the Wasp was a </p><p>stupendous surprise to him. </p><p> When they had commenced to transfer</p><p>the prisoners to the Ormsby, the search-light </p><p>was switched from the II asp v after-decks </p><p>to the Ormsby's fore-decks. I hat left the </p><p>stern portion of the destroyer in black </p><p>shadow. “I took a chance,” was the way </p><p>Dooin put it. He climbed down from the </p><p>l&gt;oat-skids, .slid down a rope to the H'a:.p's </p><p>deck and made his way below to the offi- </p><p>cers' quarters. The place was deserted, and </p><p>he had secreted himself in the storeroom. </p><p> “But the clothes—and the accent?” I</p><p>asked.</p><p> “Got them this morning, ’ he replied.</p><p>“The steward’s bunk is just off the pantry. </p><p>The clothes were there; they fitted me and </p><p>I put them on. I knew I would be discov- </p><p>ered sooner or later, and I had to mask my </p><p>identity. It was easy. I’ve played the </p><p>Cockney before.” </p><p> 1 told him of my conversations with Dacy</p><p>and my discovery of Dacy’s objective. </p><p> “It is the Mauresubia," I said. “The</p><p>gold is there and they are going after it. </p><p>They have their escape all planned; Dacy </p><p>mentioned powerful friends ashore.'’ </p><p> “That’s Oates, he means,” commented</p><p>Dooin. </p><p> “I don’t know how they expect to get the</p><p>loot away from the MauresubiaI added. </p><p>“But they can capture the liner easily </p><p>enough. Dacy captured the British naval </p><p>code-book last night, and by means of it </p><p>he has been in communication with the </p><p>Mauresubia by wireless. She is waiting for </p><p>us to come up with her. She expects the </p><p>Wasp to act as her convoy.” </p><p> “They are slick, all right,’’ swore Dooin.</p><p>“When does the show come off?'' </p><p> “Don’t know. Tomorrow, I think.”</p><p>“Well, I must hustle back to my bunk </p><p>before that big coon misses me." </p><p> “But what shall we do?” 1 asked.</p><p> “Is there a chance to reach the wireless</p><p>and send a message?” </p><p> “No,” I answered. “Wireless plant is in</p><p>the chart-room and somebody is always </p><p>there.” </p><p> “Then we can do nothing for the pres-</p><p>ent,” he stated. </p><p> “But think of what happened last night, ’</p><p>I exclaimed. “My God, Dooin. there must </p><p>be women and children on board the Maurc- </p><p>subia!” </p><p> “It won’t do them any good for us to get</p><p>our throats slit,” was his rejoinder. Do </p><p>nothing rash, McNeil. Obey their orders </p><p>until we see a chance to queer Lheir game. </p><p>Holy smoke! This is the bigg&amp;fc job I ever </p><p>heard of. There must be a weak spot some- </p><p>where in their armor.” </p><p> “And what if we reach the Maxresulia</p><p>Gold at Sea </p><p>before you find the weak spot?” I de- </p><p>manded. </p><p> “Do nothing,” he admonished. “Let</p><p>them go ahead and get the boodle. We </p><p>couldn’t prevent them anyway. Our chance </p><p>will come to spoil this little jaunt. I can </p><p>use this pipe here to spy upon every room </p><p>in the quarters—be strange if I don’t dis-</p><p>cover something we can turn to our advan- </p><p>tage. But we must pull the wool over their </p><p>eyes, McNeil. Whatever you do, don’t give </p><p>us away.” </p><p> “All right,” I assented. “I’ll wait for</p><p>you to make the break. Say, you recall </p><p>that girl I helped on West Street? That </p><p>blackguard, Dacy, had her picture in his </p><p>possession. I have it here. What can that </p><p>crook have in common with Miss Morri- </p><p>son? He must have stolen it somewhere. </p><p>Why, she was the truest-looking, most-” </p><p> “Huh! No doubt, no doubt,” grunted</p><p>Dooin. “Well, I must beat it back to my </p><p>little bed before my Ethiopian boss starts </p><p>gum-shoeing after me. Remember, Mac, </p><p>go easy. So long!” </p><p> The voice ceased, and the body in the</p><p>duct slid out of sight. Straining my ears </p><p>against the opening of the ventilator, I </p><p>could hear, above the ship noises, the rustle </p><p>of Dooin’s body as he dragged himself </p><p>through the pipe. </p><p> “Good night!” I called softly.</p><p> I turned to my own bed. I was almost</p><p>happy. A great load had been lifted from </p><p>my mind. I had faith in Dooin. </p><p>XII </p><p>I WAS due on watch at two o’clock </p><p>in the morning, but it was nearly </p><p>four o’clock before I was called. </p><p>When I reached the engine-room, I discov- </p><p>ered the reason for the two hours’ grace. </p><p> “Youi vill be on watch der whole day,</p><p>maybe, Von Werner informed me. “I vill </p><p>be otherwise engaged.” </p><p> He left me a prey to all sorts of nervous</p><p>conjectures. The intermittent buzzing of </p><p>the wireless overhead added to my excite- </p><p>ment. </p><p>thAltf°°rn as was daylight, I left the </p><p>^ ? a a.n instanl ^&lt;1 climbed to the </p><p>deck. A swift search of the horizon re- </p><p>warded me with a glimpse of a faint, far </p><p>smoke-smudge in the northern sky. Our </p><p>dows were pointed toward it. </p><p> My moment on deck appraised me also</p><p>of a bustle of preparation throughout the </p><p>ship. The whole crew was astir. </p><p> The “yo-heave-ho” of a crowd working</p><p>aft directed my attention toward our stern. </p><p>The hatch to the aftermost compartment </p><p>was open, and a gang, under Raider's com- </p><p>mand, was engaged in whipping boxes of </p><p>stores and ammunition out upon the deck. </p><p>I divined instantly that they were making </p><p>room for a more precious cargo. Even as I </p><p>looked, the gang began to jettison the pile</p><p>on the deck. </p><p> Farther aft, a couple of men were over-</p><p>hauling the gear of the whale-boat which </p><p>swung in davits, the only small boat the </p><p>Wasp possessed. The United States Navy </p><p>deserter was working upon the amidship </p><p>gun, and I saw some live shells, nose up- </p><p>ward, on the deck behind him. </p><p> I dropped back into the engine-room just</p><p>in time to receive an order from the bridge </p><p>to increase the speed. “Open her up and </p><p>drive her,*’ came Dacy’s voice through the </p><p>speaking-tube. I rang to the fire-rooms for </p><p>steam, and in a few moments the H as/&gt; was </p><p>racking herself with a thirty-six knot </p><p>gait. </p><p> A little while later. Dooin appeared in</p><p>the hatchway above. He bore my breakfast </p><p>on a tray, and nimbly negotiated the de- </p><p>scent of the ladder with one free hand. </p><p> “ ’Ere you are, sir—’kew, sir,” was his</p><p>greeting. </p><p> He placed the food on the log-desk, as-</p><p>sured himself that he could not be over- </p><p>heard by one of the oilers and continued in </p><p>his own voice. </p><p> “There is a big, black, four-funnel steam-</p><p>er a few miles ahead of us. She is stopped.’’ </p><p> “It is the Mauresubiasaid I. “W aiting</p><p>for us to come up with her.” </p><p> “There are great doings on deck,” added</p><p>Dooin. “Those sports are up to some more </p><p>slick work.” </p><p> “What now?” I asked.</p><p> “They are parading around dressed up</p><p>like Germans,” he answered. “They are </p><p>all dressed in German Navy uniforms. </p><p>Dacy is swelled up like a Dutch admir.d.” </p><p> “Good Lord! They must be going to</p><p>pass themselves off as Germans!" I ex- </p><p>claimed. </p><p> “Where did they get the duds?” asked</p><p>Dooin. </p><p> The memory of the two big packing-cases</p><p>I had seen transferred from the Omsby's </p><p>forecastle to the	forecastle, flashed</p><p>Adventure </p><p>across my inind. Dacy had mentioned uni- </p><p>forms when they had been produced. </p><p> “They brought them from New York,” 1</p><p>told Dooin. “They had them on the Orms- </p><p>by.” </p><p> “Well, they are all fixed up like Dutch-</p><p>men, now,” he said. “1 guess those sports </p><p>on the Maurcsubia will get the surprise of </p><p>their lives in a few moments. So long—I’ve </p><p>got to beat it!” </p><p> We came up with the prize rapidly.</p><p>Twenty minutes after Dooin had left me, I </p><p>received a sigual-bell to slow the starboard </p><p>engine. I knew we were turning. A second </p><p>bell directed me to slow' both engines, a third </p><p>bell to stop. </p><p> I swung shut the throttles, and in the</p><p>same instant the ship shook from stem to </p><p>stern from gun fire overhead—four shots, in </p><p>rapid succession. </p><p> I leaped for the ladder at the first shot,</p><p>and the concussion from the last one lifted </p><p>the cap from my head as I reached the deck. </p><p> The Mauresubia lay close aboard on our</p><p>port side, not more than five hundred yards </p><p>distant. She lay motionless, towering above </p><p>the water like a sky-scraper above the side- </p><p>walk. Her decks were filled with rushing, </p><p>gesticulating figures. Both of her topmasts </p><p>had been shot awray, and the whole fabric </p><p>of her wireless was jumbled along her hur- </p><p>ricane-deck. </p><p> The gang on the Wasp was cheering.</p><p>Each of the three guns in the port batten’’ </p><p>was manned, and the smoke still trailed </p><p>from the amidship gun, where the Navy </p><p>deserter had his eye glued to ihe sights. I </p><p>looked forward. Up to our signal yard ran </p><p>a ball of bunting. A jerk of the halyard, </p><p>and it broke into the German naval colors. </p><p> Dooin had spoken truth. Every man in</p><p>sight upon the Wasp's deck, with the ex- </p><p>ception of myself, was dressed in a German </p><p>uniform. Raider dashed past me, going aft. </p><p>He was dressed as a German officer. An- </p><p>other man, garbed as officer, appeared upon </p><p>the wing of our bridge with a megaphone. </p><p>It was Von Werner. He bellowed across </p><p>the intervening strip of water to the Maure- </p><p>subia. </p><p> “You vas summoned to surrender to der</p><p>Imperial German Government! If you do </p><p>nod so, we vill sink you!” </p><p> “All right, all right!” came the answering</p><p>hail. “For God’s sake, don’t lire into us </p><p>again—we have women and children on </p><p>board!” </p><p> Yon Werner descended the bridge and</p><p>hurried aft, followed by Dacy. If the uni- </p><p>form had metamorphosed the German, an </p><p>even more startling change had been effect- </p><p>ed in Dacy’s appearance. He wore the uni- </p><p>form of a commander in the German Navy, </p><p>and his mustaches were waxed and trained </p><p>into the fierce upward thrust affected by </p><p>the Teutonic military'. His iron features </p><p>and his carriage were typical of the Prussian </p><p>aristocrat. </p><p> Raider and a crew of men were getting</p><p>the whaleboat into the water. Toward </p><p>them hurried Von Werner and Dacy. </p><p> The Wasp was drifting astern. A bell</p><p>from the bridge called me back to the en- </p><p>gine-room. For several moments I was </p><p>busy with the engines while Henderson </p><p>worked the ship back into position. </p><p> When next I poked my head through the</p><p>hatchway, the whaleboat was bobbing at </p><p>the Maurcsubia's side. Dacy and Yon Wer- </p><p>ner were ascending a rope-ladder to the </p><p>liner’s decks. The liner's rails were black </p><p>with people watching the ascent, and the </p><p>panic had passed. </p><p> Then, a bell from the bridge recalled me</p><p>to my duties below. It was in this broken </p><p>fashion, a moment now and then, that I </p><p>witnessed the looting of the Mauresubia. </p><p>Of what happened on the Mauresubia's </p><p>decks I learned nothing until long after- </p><p>ward, when I read the newspaper version. </p><p> This told ho^v the Mauresubia awaited</p><p>the arrival of H. M. S. Wasp upon the re- </p><p>ceipt of code wireless messages announcing </p><p>that the	was to act as the Mauresu-</p><p>bia's convoy until she reached the Grand </p><p>Banks; how, upon the	appearance</p><p>she steamed close and fired into the liner, </p><p>sending both topmasts by the board and </p><p>wounding the first and fifth officers; how it </p><p>was discovered that the Wasp was in the </p><p>enemy’s possession. </p><p> How Commander Yon Schlossman and</p><p>Lieutenant Von Werner boarded the liner; </p><p>and while Commander Yon Schlossman. in </p><p>broken English, demanded possession of the </p><p>specie in the liner’s strong-box, Lieutenant </p><p>Yon Werner invaded the wireless-room and </p><p>utterly demolished the apparatus with a </p><p>fire-ax. How Captain Lorens of the Man- </p><p>resubia, with the weight of three thousand </p><p>lives upon his shoulders, and helpless before </p><p>the menace of the destroyer’s guns, co‘’ld </p><p>do nothing but accede to the German i‘tn- </p><p>cer's demands. How Commander \ on </p><p>Gold at Sea </p><p>Schlossman thereupon produced manifests </p><p>containing an accurate description of the </p><p>contents of the liner’s strong-room. </p><p> How the German captain was recognized</p><p>by one of the Mauresubia’s passengers, and </p><p>promptly took drastic and unheard-of meas- </p><p>ures as a result. </p><p> Of all this I saw or knew nothing. My</p><p>duties kept me intermittently busy with </p><p>the engines. Only occasionally could I dash </p><p>up the ladder and snatch a quick look </p><p>around.</p><p> I saw the Mauresubia’s steam launch and</p><p>two of her lifeboats being lowered into the </p><p>water. Men from the whaleboat manned </p><p>them instantly. </p><p> I looked about for Dooin, but he was no-</p><p>where in sight. </p><p> On my next trip up the ladder, I found</p><p>the steam launch, with one of the lifeboats </p><p>in tow, lying by our side. The lifeboat was </p><p>laden with a cargo of small wooden boxes, </p><p>bound with iron straps. There were not </p><p>many of them, but their weight bore the </p><p>lifeboat almost gunwale under. </p><p> The boxes were passed aboard, and Rai-</p><p>der and his gang received them with whoops </p><p>and cheers. They dispatched them through </p><p>the hatch into the after compartment, </p><p>where they had earlier made room by jet- </p><p>tisoning stores. </p><p> On board the Mauresubia they were low-</p><p>ering more boxes into the second lifeboat. </p><p>The IKajp’i whaleboat lay on her oars a </p><p>short distance from the liner’s side, and in </p><p>the slern-sheets I noticed an alien figure </p><p>wrapped in a cloak. But I was too much </p><p>excited by the sight of the little wooden </p><p>boxes to comment upon this. </p><p> 1 hey fascinated me, those little square</p><p>boxes all the same size, all bound with </p><p>iron straps. To and fro, hour after hour, </p><p>the launch steamed between the liner and </p><p>our side, towing the lifeboats. Each trip </p><p>brought us a fortune. </p><p> I he boxes seemed innumerable. I never</p><p>knew their exact number, but there were </p><p>hundreds of them. Raider and his men la- </p><p>bored like demons in trans-shipping the </p><p>treasure and getting it safely stowed in the </p><p>after compartment. Expeditiously, and </p><p>without a single hitch, the work proceeded. </p><p> Throughout the entire time, the gun-</p><p>crews remained at the Wasp’s guns and kept </p><p>the weapons trained upon the Mauresubia's </p><p>vitals. They were a deadly threat that the </p><p>Maurcsubia's officers did well to heed. </p><p> THE transfer of the gold took most</p><p> of the morning. Not a surprising</p><p> circumstance when you consider</p><p> that more than twenty-five tons of the metal</p><p> were handled. It was after eleven o’clock</p><p> when a final, rousing cheer appraised me</p><p> that the task was completed. When next I</p><p> peered through the hatchway, Raider’s gang</p><p> was clamping down the after hatch.</p><p> The Mauresubia was hoisting inboard her</p><p> launch, and the whaleboat was returning</p><p> to our side. In the stern-sheets sat Dacy</p><p> and Von Werner, and between them was</p><p> wedged a slight, boyish figure wrapped in a</p><p> cloak.</p><p> I had no chance to witness their arrival,</p><p> for Henderson’s imperative jangle recalled</p><p> me to my w'ork. Soon, from my station on</p><p> the floor-plates, I heard the “yo-ho-ho” of</p><p> the men hoisting the whaleboat aboard.</p><p> Immediately afterward I received the sig-</p><p> nal to go astern.</p><p> We backed slowly, and stopped again.</p><p> Suddenly the ship trembled from the shock</p><p> and roar of one of the guns. Two—three</p><p> shots! The horrible thought hit me, “They</p><p> are sinking her!” I left the throttles and</p><p> leaped for the ladder.</p><p> Our backing had brought us opposite the</p><p> Mauresubia*s stern. Her great half-round</p><p> hull towered opposite us; panic was again</p><p> rife upon her decks. Her officers were</p><p> wildly hailing from her bridge.</p><p> Our amidship gun still W’reathed smoke,</p><p> and the navy gunner had it trained upon a</p><p> spot beneath the liner’s counter. I followed</p><p> the direction of the muzzle with my eyes,</p><p> and saw that the liner’s rudder had been</p><p> shot away.</p><p> Dacy was standing by the gun, a pleased</p><p> expression on his face.</p><p> “She s crippled!” I heard him exclaim.</p><p> “With her wireless and rudder gone she</p><p> w'on't be able to bother us. She’ll make</p><p> slow headway steering with her propellers.</p><p> We may not be reported for a couple of</p><p> days.</p><p> I ducked below* again. In a few moments</p><p> came the order for full speed ahead, and</p><p> the added urge through the speaking-tube</p><p> to drive her. I had a full head of steam,</p><p> and I opened her up. In a few moments</p><p> we were racing away from the crippled liner</p><p> at a thirty-six knot clip.</p><p> Three hours longer I stayed on watch ere</p><p> \ on VV erner came. My oilers were relieved,</p><p> and the men who took their places were</p><p>Adventure </p><p>part of the whaleboat’s crew. T was burst- </p><p>ing with curiosity, but I could not bring </p><p>myself to question them. But I could see </p><p>that they were drunken with the thought </p><p>of what they had helped do. The thought </p><p>of it made my own brain reel. </p><p> Twenty-five tons of gold! Twelve mil-</p><p>lions of dollars! </p><p> Dacy had achieved the impossible. The</p><p>treasure was his. Beneath our hatches were </p><p>the little square boxes with the iron straps. </p><p>Twelve million—a fortune for each man! </p><p> And, unbidden, the insidious thought</p><p>crept into my mind, “You need but to keep </p><p>your mouth shut and you, too, will have a </p><p>fortune to spend. You, too, will share in </p><p>the cutting of the melon.” </p><p> But would I? Would I, who had kept</p><p>aloof from the gang, be considered in the </p><p>division of the spoils? I felt sure I would </p><p>be. Dacy was a man to keep his word. He </p><p>had promised me. Two hundred thousand </p><p>dollars! What could I not do with such a </p><p>sum? How pleasant life would be! </p><p> And then I thought of Dooin, and of the</p><p>promise I had given the little man. I cursed </p><p>myself for a knave for even idly dreaming </p><p>such thoughts, and gave my full attention </p><p>to my work. </p><p> The nursing of the engines soon occupied</p><p>my full attention, without any effort of </p><p>mind. The command came from the bridge </p><p>to “shake her out—drive her till the rivets </p><p>rattle!” I obeyed. I drove her until she </p><p>shook from stem to stern with the vibra- </p><p>tion. I took an unreasonable, but to an </p><p>engineer a natural, delight in my task and </p><p>its results. Thirty-six, thirty-six and a half, </p><p>thirty-seven! When Von Werner appeared </p><p>to relieve me, I w'as getting a full knot and </p><p>a quarter more than the builder’s best out </p><p>of the Wasp. </p><p> Von Werner had discarded his German</p><p>uniform for his dungarees. Instead of his </p><p>face being suffused with a glow of triumph, </p><p>as I had expected, he wore a troubled </p><p>look. </p><p> “I suppose you arc- overjoyed,” I re-</p><p>marked. “You have got the gold, and are </p><p>making the escape.” </p><p> He shook his head.</p><p> “1 vas nod joyous,” he said. “Der gold,</p><p>ja, dot vas good. But der woman—dot vas </p><p> “What are you talking about?” I asked.</p><p> “Der woman—dot vas bad. Captain</p><p>Daev bring to tlic Vasp back a woman. </p><p>She vas young, uud a lady. 1 like it nod.” </p><p>“A woman!” 1 cried. "Do you mean to </p><p>say that there ii&gt; a woman on board?'1 </p><p> uJa. From der Mauresubia he bring her.</p><p>She vas his sweetheart, berhaps. She rec- </p><p>ognize him und cry, und he bring her away, </p><p>it vas for safety'—yet I like it nod. She </p><p>vas young und a lady, und it vas bad to </p><p>bring her together with dis hell-scum.” </p><p> I clid not like it either, though at first I</p><p>was more curious than troubled. It seemed </p><p>a devilish thing to bring a woman amidst </p><p>these desperate men. I wonderc l what she </p><p>w’as like, but Yon Werner could only assert </p><p>that she was young, and a lady.</p><p> By this time, the Mauresubia had long</p><p>since been left beneath the northern hori- </p><p>zon. The 11 'asp was racing southward, and </p><p>when I reached the deck I found it difficult </p><p>to maintain a footing, so great was the vi- </p><p>bration from the speeding engines. The </p><p>decks were wet with spindrift from the tre- </p><p>mendous bone the !!’&lt;;?/&gt; carried in her </p><p>teeth. Our wake was a lane of white water. </p><p>The deck-plates actually heaved beneath </p><p>one’s feet. </p><p> But these visible signs of our great speed</p><p>I merely noticed subconsciously as I made </p><p>my way to the cabin-hatch. It was an old </p><p>experience for me; I had seen it l ei - t-.-, many </p><p>times. I was hungry, and I bent iny steps </p><p>directly toward the ward-room, where I </p><p>knew food would be upon the table. </p><p> Turk and Dooin were in the ward-room,</p><p>and the meal was awaiting me as I had ex- </p><p>pected. </p><p> “ ’Ere you are, sir,” greeted Dooin in his</p><p>best Cockneyse. “Just tyke this chair, sir. </p><p>’Arve you dinner hall ready, an' piping ot. </p><p>Just tyke a bit o’ this, sir. Gyve some to </p><p>the Ivdy, an it ’elperl her a lot.” </p><p> “What is that?” I said, as Turk passed</p><p>out of ear-shot into the pantry. “Is there </p><p>really a woman on board?” </p><p> “Yep, and a pippin, too,” he answered.</p><p>“She’s a friend of yours, maybe. </p><p> “But who is she—where is she? I a^ked.</p><p>“Search me who she is,” was his easy re- </p><p>sponse. “She’s a swell-looking dam-., all </p><p>ri&lt;;ht. She's in the Captain’s room. Dacy </p><p>turned it over to her.” He bustled about, </p><p>placing food upon a tray. “Say. I got some </p><p>news. I've found out something that will </p><p>turn to our advantage, I think. I have to </p><p>take this tray up to the bridge. Afterward </p><p>I’ll duck into your room and wait for you. </p><p>I’ve got something to show you. </p><p>Gold at Sea </p><p> He balanced his tray on his hand and de-</p><p>parted for the deck. I applied myself to </p><p>the meal, speculating upon the nature of </p><p>the news Dooin had for me. </p><p> I heard a gasp, and lifted my eyes. The</p><p>sight I encountered brought me to my feet </p><p>with a sharp cry of astonishment. </p><p> Framed in the ward-room door was a</p><p>woman. She was staring at me with wide- </p><p>open eyes and parted lips. It was my dream </p><p>woman—it was Mar)' Morrison! </p><p>XIII </p><p>“YOU!” she gasped. </p><p>“You!” I echoed. </p><p>We stared as if each were an ap-</p><p>parition. </p><p> For the moment I could not think, could</p><p>not wonder. I simply stared, mouth agape, </p><p>and realized the stupendous fact that this </p><p>girl, who had so strangely filled my mind </p><p>during the past days, was again before me </p><p>in the living flesh. </p><p> She advanced into the room, and as she</p><p>came toward me I had the crazy, fleeting </p><p>notion that she was but another fantasy ol </p><p>m&gt; mind, and that she would presently dis- </p><p>solve into the nothingness she came from. </p><p>She grasped the back of a chair to steady </p><p>herself against the uneasy motion of the </p><p>ship, and I saw the pink of her knuckles </p><p>whiten under the pressure of her grip. Still </p><p>I stared at her, incapable of connected </p><p>thought. </p><p> Her body trembled more than the he?.vy</p><p>vibration of the engines made necessary’; </p><p>her bosom heaved unevenly. Her face was </p><p>haggard, in spite of its youthful freshness; </p><p>about her eyes were reddened circles. The </p><p>great crown of her hair was a tumbled mass </p><p>oi gold. Yet the disorder but enhanced her </p><p>loveliness. </p><p> Her eyes were moist—misty with tears;</p><p>and in their depths I seemed to glimpse de- </p><p>spair and a biting sorrow. She leaned over </p><p>the back of the chair and looked at me in- </p><p>tently. </p><p>“You here with Roger!" she said. “Oh— </p><p>I thought you were different. I dreamed </p><p>that you oh, why are you all evil?” she </p><p>brushed passionately. </p><p>You dreamed—you, too, have dream- </p><p>ed. I babbled, grasping at the word. </p><p>Vou, too, have dreamed, and could not </p><p>help yourself!” </p><p> “I—I thought that you-”</p><p> She paused, and I became conscious that</p><p> her face was crimsoned, and that a fright-</p><p> ened, uncertain glance w?as in her regard.</p><p> Then her eyes grew hard and bright, and</p><p> she spoke incisively.</p><p> “I do not dream of rogues. I had a grate-</p><p> ful remembrance of your service to me. I</p><p> thought you were a gentleman, and now’ I</p><p> find you here with this crowd. Oh, I</p><p> thought-”</p><p> She faltered. Two great tears rolled out</p><p> of the corners of her eyes and coursed down</p><p> her cheeks.</p><p> Her w'ords were a splash of cold water</p><p> upon the face of my consciousness. They</p><p> shocked me to a sudden awakening to the</p><p> situation.</p><p> “My God!” I cried. “Was it you they</p><p> brought from the Mauresubia?” And then,</p><p> with the evidence of her person before me,</p><p> I W’as aware of the inanity of the query.</p><p> “The devil!” I swore. “By heavens. I'll</p><p> kill the man-”</p><p> “Stop!” she cried. “Oh, the shame—al-</p><p> ready you would fight over me like a dog</p><p> over a bone!”</p><p> “No, no, you misunderstand!” I exclaim-</p><p> ed. “If that blackguard, Daev, harms</p><p> you-”</p><p> “Stop!” she cried again. “I do not know</p><p> what position you occupy here, Mr. Mc-</p><p> Neil, but I presume that'you are subordi-</p><p> nate to the man you are vilifying. It is a</p><p> mean thing to malign a man behind his</p><p> back.”</p><p> I stared at her astounded. The transfor-</p><p> mation was instantaneous and complete.</p><p> She stood with head thrown back, and her</p><p> figure quivering with resentment. Her</p><p> words were hot with anger.</p><p> “But but,” I blundered on, “the vile</p><p> cur-”</p><p> “How dare you!” she blazed. “Oh_</p><p> I 11 not listen to such a cowardly attack</p><p> upon the character of a better man than</p><p> yourself. Y'ou would not dare to face him</p><p> with such words!”</p><p> She hurled the words at me vehemently,</p><p> and with a wealth of contempt in her voice.</p><p> I hen she turned and rushed from the room</p><p> into the passage, and I heard the door of</p><p> Uacy s room close behind her.</p><p> For many minutes I stood, staring blank-</p><p> Jy at the door through which she passed,</p><p> my brain numbed and stupid with the shock</p><p> of her appearance and tempestuous depar-</p><p> ture. Finally I recovered control over my</p><p>Adventure </p><p>legs, if not of my wits, and made my way </p><p>to my own room. </p><p>DOOIN was seated upon the edge </p><p>of my bunk, awaiting my appear- </p><p>ance with visible impatience. </p><p>“Thought you would never come,'' he </p><p>greeted. “Been waiting fifteen minutes.” </p><p>“Dooin, I have just seen the girl,” I ex- </p><p>claimed. “Good heavens! Do you know </p><p>who she is? She is the West Street girl— </p><p>the girl I told you about!” </p><p> “Oh, yes,” he returned, unmoved. “Did-</p><p>n’t I say she was a friend of yours?" </p><p> "But the girl—that girl!” I raced on.</p><p>“They have kidnapped her! Think of the </p><p>position she is in! Good God, man, what </p><p>will-” </p><p> “Huh—don’t you worry about her, Mac,”</p><p>he interrupted. “Dacy will take care: of </p><p>her—she’s his doll.” </p><p> 1 obeyed an irresistible impulse. I reach-</p><p>ed out and throttled the little man, shook </p><p>him like a terrier shakes a rat. </p><p> “Hey—you fool! Easy! What are you</p><p>trying to do?” he panted. </p><p> The gust of passion passed, and I relaxed</p><p>my grasp. Dooin sank into a chair, clutch- </p><p>ing at his throat. </p><p> '‘Gee, but you are a sudden gink,” he ob-</p><p>served. “What is eating you, anyway?” </p><p>“How dare you refer to that young lady </p><p>as an intimate of Dacy’s?” </p><p> •‘Huh! Holy smoke! I didn’t know that</p><p>dame had your goat. Dacy knows her, I </p><p>tell you—knows her well enough to kiss her, </p><p>anyway. Hey—keep away from me! Try </p><p>that again and I'll bust you over the head </p><p>with this bottle. It’s the truth; I saw him </p><p>do it. And he moved out and gave her his </p><p>own room.” </p><p> Again the flame flared within me. I</p><p>clenched my fists, but with an effort kept </p><p>myself from seizing the little man. </p><p> “You lit—I say you lie!” I cried. ‘‘She</p><p>is a prisoner!” </p><p> “All right, all right, T’ll take your word</p><p>for it,” he answered. “I didn’t know you </p><p>knew her very well. I thought you just </p><p>saw her the one time.” </p><p> “That makes no difference,” I retorted.</p><p>“I tell you 1 know—I tell you she is a lady!” </p><p>“Gee, I didn’t know she had you going </p><p>like that,” was his answer. “All right, she </p><p>is beauty in distress. But don’t you worry </p><p>about her safety. I saw her and Dacy to- </p><p>gether, and he is her friend. </p><p> “I don’t care what you saw. She is true</p><p> blue, and-”</p><p> “Sure, and a yard wide. Bui say, don’t</p><p> you go too much on first impressions. Tin y</p><p> aren’t worth a darn where women are con-</p><p> cerned.”</p><p> “Do you mean to intimate-”</p><p> “Intimate nothing,” said Dooin. “I</p><p> don’t know anything about her. And any-</p><p> how, I didn't sneak in here to talk about</p><p> her. This is what brought me here.”</p><p> He pointed, and I noticed a cigar-box</p><p> lying upon my bunk. Dooin picked it up</p><p> and tapped it significantly.</p><p> “I have it here,” he stated.</p><p> “Have what?” I asked.</p><p> “Mr. Podd’s little peculiarities,” he an-</p><p> swered.</p><p> I regarded the box with uncomprehend-</p><p> ing interest, and for the moment the girl</p><p> slipped into the back of my mind.</p><p> “What do you mean?” 1 asked.</p><p> Dooin raised the lid. I saw that the box</p><p> was about half filled with cigarette-papers,</p><p> twisted into pellets.</p><p> “What do you think of that?” remarked</p><p> Dooin, triumphantly.</p><p> He took one of the pellets in his hand</p><p> and untwisted the paper. Then he oiTered</p><p> the contents for my inspection.</p><p> “What do you call it?” he demanded.</p><p> I shook my head.</p><p> “Looks like flour—or snow.”</p><p> “Snow—that's just what it is."</p><p> I looked at him rather blankly.</p><p> “It is Podd’s ioy-stuff,” he continued.</p><p> “There is enough snow here to make a man</p><p> see rosy for a month. It's dope—coke—</p><p> cocaine, you know. Friend Podd in on the</p><p> junk. He takes cocaine.''</p><p> I looked at the white powder curiouslv.</p><p> So here was the reason for Podd’s moodi-</p><p> ness and flights of queer fancy. But how</p><p> did it affect Dooin and myself?</p><p> “Well, what of it?" I asked.</p><p> “What of it?” he mimicked. “Say—did</p><p> you ever have anything to do with a dope-</p><p> fiend?”</p><p> “No,” I answered.</p><p> “Well, when a man is on the junk espe-</p><p> cially when he is a cocaine floater—he is a.</p><p> nut. Does that suggest anything to you?</p><p> “No,” I said. “I told you the other day</p><p> that Podd was bughouse.”</p><p> Dooin regarded me sorrowfully.</p><p> “She’s stolen your wit," he bemoaned. ^</p><p> “What are you driving at/' I demandcu.</p><p>Gold at Sea </p><p>169 </p><p> “I see I’ll have to educate you,” he com-</p><p>menced briskly. “I am going to impart a </p><p>secret of my profession. </p><p> “When we want to get a guy, Mac, we</p><p>look for his weak spot. A criminal always </p><p>has a weak spot. Usually it is either dope, </p><p>or booze, or women—sometimes all three. </p><p>When you know a man’s weakness you have </p><p>a hold upon him. I spotted Podd for a </p><p>dope-user the first time I saw him. I think </p><p>I could name Dacy’s weakness—a short </p><p>word that begins s-h-e- </p><p> “Stop it!” I interjected.</p><p> ‘‘Sure—and about nine-tenths of the</p><p>gang could be reached through booze. </p><p> “Dope is the leverage we can use upon</p><p>Mr. Podd. It is the best—or the worst— </p><p>of the three. A dope-fiend is a slave, and </p><p>anybody who can control liis drug supply</p><p>is his master—master of his body and his </p><p>soul. Podd is an old floater; all the better </p><p>for us. With his dope shut off, he will be </p><p>as crazy as a loon and as pliable as putty </p><p>in less than twenty-four hours.” </p><p> “Yes, but what good will that do us?” I</p><p>demanded. “We can’t do anything. Podd </p><p>is no sort of an addition to our fighting </p><p>strength.” </p><p> “Fight, fight—that’s all you can think</p><p>of,” complained Dooin. “We don’t intend </p><p>to fight. Here is the plan: The Ormsby </p><p>has been adrift all day, hasn’t she? And </p><p>we are near the coast, in waters that are </p><p>crowded with coastwise craft. The chances </p><p>are that the Ormsby has already been sight- </p><p>ed, and the piracy of this craft made knoWn. </p><p>Perhaps the Mauresubia will meet some </p><p>ship.” </p><p> “The Mauresubia should be able to reach</p><p>the coast some time tomorrow,” I said. </p><p>“She will make slow time with her rudder </p><p>disabled. She will have to steer with her </p><p>propellers. But she should be able to com- </p><p>municate her news by this time tomorrow, </p><p>at the latest, even if she speaks no ship. Of </p><p>course, both ships’ wireless were destroyed.” </p><p>'But the Il'as/A wireless is in good con- </p><p>dition,” said Dooin. </p><p> 'You mean to force Podd to send a mes-</p><p>sage!” I exclaimed, as the drift of the little </p><p>man s talk suddenly reached me. </p><p> J see a glimmer of reason is return-</p><p>mg to you.” he said. “Yes, exactly. As </p><p>soon as this affair becomes known, there </p><p>will be plenty of searchers after Dacy. We </p><p>must get an S. O. S. out some way.” </p><p> “But what goodwill that do?” 1 objected.</p><p>“We don’t know where we are going—we </p><p>have no position to give. The Atlantic </p><p>Ocean is a pretty big place.” </p><p> “Can’t you make a guess?”</p><p> “No, how can I? All I know is that we</p><p>were about four hundred miles north of </p><p>New York’s latitude when we held up the </p><p>Mauresubia. We are bound south now at </p><p>full speed. We are about three hundred </p><p>miles off shore.” </p><p> “Where will we be this time tomorrow?”</p><p>“Somewhere off the North Carolina coast </p><p>if Dacy keeps to his present course. There </p><p>is one thing I do know—we can’t keep up </p><p>our present gait for forty hours longer. </p><p>This ship’s steaming radius is 280c miles, </p><p>but that is at an economical speed. Driving </p><p>the boilers the way we are now, the oil will </p><p>last less than two days. But Dacy can </p><p>make some 1500 miles before then. Noth-</p><p>ing save one of our own navy’s new destroy- </p><p>ers could overhaul this craft.” </p><p> “Then we must get one after us,” said</p><p>Dooin. “Dacy is bound for some place to </p><p>get rid of the gold. We must find out where, </p><p>in some way. I am going to use that ven- </p><p>tilator - pipe again — maybe 1 11 overhear </p><p>something. We have twenty-four hours to </p><p>wait before Podd will be in a condition for </p><p>us to approach him.” </p><p> “You are sure we can force him to do our</p><p>will?” </p><p> “I know it. I’ve handled dopes before.</p><p>It all depends, though, upon whether or not </p><p>he can get any of the stuff from others. I </p><p>rifled the medicine-chest in the ward-room </p><p>and removed all the morphia and cocaine it </p><p>contained, but Farley, or some of the crowd </p><p>forward, might have some. I don’t think </p><p>so, though. None of them look like drug- </p><p>users.” </p><p> “How did you get possession of the</p><p>stull?” I asked. </p><p> "I had Podd spotted for a fiend, and was</p><p>waiting for my chance,” he replied. “While </p><p>the boodle was being transferred from the </p><p>Mauresubia, my gentle nigger boss was im- </p><p>proving his time by sticking close to Raider </p><p>ana gloating on the boxes being lowered </p><p>through the hatch. I seized the opportu- </p><p>nity and frisked Podd’s room. I found the </p><p>box under the mattress on his bunk.” </p><p> “Won’t Podd make a row about it? They</p><p>may suspect you.” </p><p> “You bet your sweet life Podd will make</p><p>a row! It is like stealing his life to deprive </p><p>a snow-user of his drug. He’ll raise Cain </p><p>17 o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>—but I am going to hide the box in that </p><p>ventilator-pipe, and there isn’t any danger </p><p>of them discovering it. And I’m pretty </p><p>sure I can disarm any suspicion those sports </p><p>may have that I'm the guilty gink. They </p><p>don’t regard me as a man, you know. I’m </p><p>just a Cockney flunkey. I got to beat it </p><p>now, I suppose that coon is already look- </p><p>ing for me.” </p><p> After Dooin’s stealthy and safe departure,</p><p>I went to the ward-room and hung about </p><p>there for some time hoping for another </p><p>glimpse of the girl. The room was deserted. </p><p>Dacy and his lieutenants spent most of their </p><p>time upon the bridge, just coming below oc- </p><p>casionally to wolf the food that was ever </p><p>present upon the ward-room table. But </p><p>none of them appeared during my wait. </p><p>Nor. what was more important to me, did</p><p>Miss Morrison appear again. The door of </p><p>the Captain’s cabin, wherein Dacy had </p><p>housed her, remained closed. </p><p> Finally, I returned to my room. I sought</p><p>my bunk, and for a long time I lay there, </p><p>thinking; not thinking of Dooin or Podd, or </p><p>of Dacy or gold, but thinking of the girl. </p><p> Try as I would, and I did try, I could</p><p>not banish her from my thoughts. In vain </p><p>I told myself that her spirited defense of </p><p>Dacy proved her to be at least his friend. </p><p>But myself would not admit the truth of </p><p>the impeachment. I recalled Dooin’s words, </p><p>and a hot, unreasonable resentment seethed </p><p>within me because of those words. I told </p><p>myself that she was a stranger, and my in- </p><p>nermost self proclaimed it false and de- </p><p>clared she was near and dear to me. </p><p> I contended impatiently with my own</p><p>conceit, but her image persisted in my </p><p>mind’s eye; her face bearing its telling marks </p><p>of suffering, her eyes tear-misty or anger- </p><p>sparkling. Yon Werner’s words recurred </p><p>to me, “She vas a lady, und 1 like it nod </p><p>that she vas here.” </p><p> Nor did I like it. She was a lady, yes,</p><p>but what was more to the point, she was a </p><p>woman in trouble. She was in a position </p><p>that might prove horribly dangerous. It </p><p>sickened me to contemplate her possible </p><p>fate. She would need me. </p><p> My blood coursed more swiftly, and an</p><p>inexplicable joy thrilled me at the thought. </p><p>She would need my help. I registered a </p><p>mental vow that I would meet the need. </p><p> At last my watch informed me that it was</p><p>high time I was on my way below to re- </p><p>lieve the German. I arose, shifted my </p><p>clothes and stepped into the passageway on </p><p>my way to the engine-room. </p><p> As I passed the ward-room door, Dacy’s</p><p>voice hailed me. I stopped, and looked </p><p>within. </p><p> What I saw hurt. For Mary Morrison</p><p>and Dacy were seated side by side on the </p><p>divan in the farther corner of the room. </p><p>His arms wrere about her, and her face was </p><p>buried in his breast. Her shoulders were </p><p>heaving, as if she were weeping. </p><p> It was not her weeping that hurt—it was</p><p>the fact that she was submitting willingly </p><p>to Dacy’s embrace. Coming so close upon </p><p>the heels of my blissful, knight - erratic </p><p>dreams, the sight struck me with the force </p><p>of a blow. </p><p> “Come here a moment, McNeil,” the</p><p>Captain called. </p><p> As I advanced toward them, Mary Mor-</p><p>rison raised her head and looked at me. </p><p>Her cheeks w'ere tear-stained, but she had </p><p>willed a cold immobility upon her features. </p><p>Her stony stare chilled. </p><p> “McNeil, have you seen a trinket laying</p><p>about anywhere—a miniature portrait uf </p><p>this young lady? I had it in my hands </p><p>while I was talking with you last evening, </p><p>just at the time that little Cockney was dis- </p><p>covered in the storeroom, and I seem to </p><p>have mislaid or lost it. I have searched </p><p>everywhere without success. I value it </p><p>very much.” </p><p> Silently I drew the bauble out of my</p><p>pocket and handed it to him. </p><p> “Why, where did you get it?” was his</p><p>surprised demand. </p><p> “You dropped it,” I said. “I picked it</p><p>up.” </p><p> “You picked it up? Then why did you</p><p>not return it before?” </p><p> “It did not occur to me to do so,’’ I re-</p><p>plied. </p><p> The girl seemed to be blinking back the</p><p>tears, but her lips curled scornfully. </p><p> “So it seems you are a sneak-thief,” she</p><p>remarked. </p><p> I flinched at the insult her words con-</p><p>veyed. Dacy regarded her with a surprised </p><p>air. </p><p> “I have met this person before, Roger,”</p><p>she told him with a biting sarcasm in her </p><p>voice. “He did me a small service—a ser- </p><p>vice out of keeping with his present occu- </p><p>pation. I dare say he is one of your very </p><p>good friends?” </p><p>“You did not term the service small at </p><p>Madame Justice </p><p>the time,” I felt bound to retort. “And I </p><p>may tell you that your Roger is no friend </p><p>of mine. I am his prisoner here—as I </p><p>thought at first you were. But now I see </p><p>you are not in need of my sympathy.” </p><p>Dacy followed our exchange with a puz- </p><p>zled regard that changed to a quizzical </p><p>smile. The girl received my words with a </p><p>face that slowly flushed as the purport of </p><p>my words sank in. I turned and flung out </p><p>of the room. </p><p> I looked back as I passed through the</p><p>door. Dan,' had his arms about her again, </p><p>and her face was lifted to his. </p><p>TO BE CONCLUDED. </p><p>MADAMB </p><p>JUSTICE- </p><p>Nev.il GHemhaw </p><p>Author of "The Black Violin," “.1 Pair of Mules,” cU. </p><p>SAW her as she was driving into</p><p>the little Louisiana village of </p><p>Landrv. She was a tall, rugged </p><p>old woman of the type—half </p><p>peasant, half small planter—which abounds </p><p>in the French parishes; and even at a dis- </p><p>tance there was that about her which made </p><p>one forget the squalidness of her battered </p><p>jumper and small, rabbit-like pony. When </p><p>she came closer and for an instant turned </p><p>her strong, resolute face toward mine, I saw </p><p>that tliis something was the dignity of a </p><p>great sorrow. I shall never forget her </p><p>look. It was like exchanging glances with </p><p>Fate. </p><p> After she had passed I asked the village-</p><p>folk about her. </p><p> 1 hat was Madame Gerac—she whom</p><p>we call Madame Justice,” they replied. </p><p>It is only on this day that you will see her </p><p>here. Tomorrow is her anniversary, and </p><p>she is upon her way to the cure with money </p><p>for a mass. She is as Tegular as the calen- </p><p>dar Uiat one. Rain or shine, it is always </p><p>the day before.” </p><p> Later, and in the quaint patois of die</p><p>(-ajun, they told me this story: </p><p>EVEN in her youth Madame Gerac </p><p>was possessed of a strong sense of </p><p>justice. She was a fine, handsome </p><p>girl, and she had many chances. Vet she did </p><p>not marry^ early. Her lovers were all nice, </p><p>manly fellows, she said, and there was little </p><p>*o choose between them. In fairness she </p><p>could not make such a choice, and she </p><p>would not marry only for a home. </p><p> Later, when Louis Gerac came along, she</p><p>accepted him at once. She could make her </p><p>choice now, she declared, and, although it </p><p>was not considered a good match, she made </p><p>it without hesitation. </p><p> Gerac owned a small farm some twenty</p><p>miles from Landry. It was in a remote, </p><p>desolate section, and the buildings were </p><p>old. The fields, bounded upon three e-id«.s </p><p>by marsh and upon the fourth by a small </p><p>wood, were alway's wet and boggy. No </p><p>matter when you plowed them, the soil </p><p>would stick to the plowshare like glue. It </p><p>was the kind of a place upon which one is </p><p>fortunate to make both ends meet. </p><p> For four years Madame Gerac worked the</p><p>farm with her husband, and in that time </p><p>two children came into her home. Of these </p><p>LE </p><p>172 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>children the first was born to her. It was a </p><p>son, and it was given the father’s name of</p><p>Louis. Gerac, like most fathers, was proud </p><p>of the child; Madame Gerac worshiped it. </p><p>In affection, as in all else, she was not one </p><p>to do things by halves. </p><p> The second child came into the Gerac</p><p>family two years later. It was an orphan, </p><p>the son of a sister of Gerac’s, and at first its </p><p>adoption met with much opposition upon </p><p>the part of iiis wife. Perhaps, realizing her </p><p>unfailing sense of justice, she caught some </p><p>glimpse of what the future must hold for </p><p>her. Perhaps it was only the natural jeal- </p><p>ousy of a mother for her only child. </p><p> But Gerac was firm. He could not aban-</p><p> don his nephew to charity, he said. Also it</p><p> was good that the little Louis should have a</p><p> playmate. Single children always became</p><p> either dull or spoiled.</p><p> In the end Madame Gerac agreed, and</p><p>the child was adopted. Its name was Paul, </p><p>and its age was the same as that of the son </p><p>of the house. Six months later, having ex- </p><p>posed himself to the weather, Gerac took </p><p>ill and died. </p><p> Her husband dead, Madame Gerac fell</p><p>upon hard times. It was difficult enough to </p><p>attend to the farm alone, but in addition to </p><p>this she had the care and responsibility of </p><p>two small children. Most women would </p><p>have solved at least a part of the problem </p><p>by turning the adopted child over to charity. </p><p>When it is a question of mouths to feed, the </p><p>difference between two and three is very </p><p>great. </p><p> Madame Gerac, however, kept her small</p><p> family intact. She would arrange, she said.</p><p> Having accepted the care of the child, no</p><p> matter how unwillingly, it was only just</p><p> that she should go on with it.</p><p> It was now, with the growing up of the</p><p> children, that the first great test of Madame</p><p> Gerac’s justice began. On the one hand was</p><p> Louis, her beloved son, the one bit of her</p><p> own flesh and blood upon earth. On the</p><p> other was Paul, the outsider, the unwel-</p><p> come guest, as it were, of a lifetime. Would</p><p> not Madame Gerac discriminate between</p><p> the two? Would it not be quite natural,</p><p> even proper perhaps, for her to do so.' Al-</p><p> ready she was spoken of as a woman of ex-</p><p> ceptional fairness. Had she been only fair,</p><p> she might have made such a discrimination.</p><p> But Madame Gerac was something more</p><p> than fair. She was just, and she did not</p><p> discriminate.</p><p> Always, from the time of Gerac’s death</p><p>to the very end, it was the same. In their </p><p>infancy the children received an equal</p><p>amount of food, of clothing, of everything. </p><p>As they grew older and took thtir places if. </p><p>the life of the farm, their work was appor- </p><p>tioned to them with an absolute impar- </p><p>tiality. Did Paul plow one day, it was Louis </p><p>who plowed the next. Did the son of the </p><p>house make holiday, the outsider might </p><p>rest assured of an equal amount of time to </p><p>be spent in his own fashion. And Madame </p><p>Gerac ever made sure that this time was so </p><p>spent to the last moment. </p><p> “No,” she would say. “What is fair for</p><p>one is fair for the other. We will have no </p><p>Cinderella business upon this place.” </p><p> Thus the children grew up, unlike in every</p><p>particular. Louis, a slender, handsome lad, </p><p>developed a lightness, an instability of </p><p>purpose which was totally at variance w-ith </p><p>the iron firmness of his mother. He de- </p><p>tested Ids work as much as he deplored its </p><p>necessity. He shirked, he complained, he </p><p>lived only for the pleasure or amusement </p><p>that was to come. With a parent less reso- </p><p>lute he would have been the most hopeless </p><p>of idlers. </p><p> Paul was exactly the reverse. Strong and</p><p>ungainly, with a huge, knotted frame, and </p><p>features that were redeemed from ugliness </p><p>only by their absolute honesty, he became </p><p>from the first a model of industry and so- </p><p>briety. No task was too hard for him, no </p><p>difficulty too great to overcome. He culti- </p><p>vated the farm as it had never been culti- </p><p>vated before. Through his efforts the little </p><p>family approached w'hat would be for </p><p>them a species of prosperity. And in ad- </p><p>dition to these other virtues, Paul was </p><p>possessed of a sense of fairness, of justice, </p><p>that was scarce inferior to that of his foster </p><p>mother.	_	,</p><p> It was strange that Louis, the son, should</p><p>be as wholly unlike his mother as Paul, the </p><p>outsider, wras similar to her in every respect. </p><p>The neighbors commented upon it. Some- </p><p>times they even jokingly inquired of Madame </p><p>Gerac if, in their infancy, she had not con- </p><p>fused the children. </p><p> “Are you quite sure that Paul is not</p><p>Louis?” they would ask. “If he is not, he </p><p>should be.” </p><p> But Madame Gerac could never appre-</p><p>ciate the humor of these remarks. </p><p> “Paul is a good boy,” she would repJv *</p><p>“but Louis is my son.” </p><p>Madame Justice </p><p>175 </p><p> Such was her attitude. Unstable, worth-</p><p>less, selfish though he might be, Louis was</p><p>her son, the recipient of her mother-love. </p><p> What she felt for Paul none knew, al-</p><p>though it was said that she could never for- </p><p>get the unwelcomeness of his arrival. His </p><p>industry might have inspired in her a feeling </p><p>of satisfaction. It could have been nothing </p><p>more ardent. </p><p>AT THE close of the Civil War, </p><p>Louis and Paul stood upon the </p><p>threshold of manhood. Thus far </p><p>they had passed their days in quiet un- </p><p>eventfulness upon the farm. The fighting </p><p>had been far away. Reports of it seldom </p><p>penetrated to such a remote district. In </p><p>Landry itself they could scarce have told </p><p>you whether the struggle had lasted one or a </p><p>dozen years. </p><p> With the beginning of reconstruction,</p><p>however, the people of this peaceful country </p><p>came to know at least of the dreadful after- </p><p>effects of war. Heretofore their affairs had </p><p>been conducted by officials carefully chosen </p><p>from among their own land. Now these </p><p>officials were thrust from office, and their </p><p>places filled by a relentless horde of carpet- </p><p>baggers. </p><p> It was a time of disaster, of injustice and</p><p>persecution. What the carpet baggers did </p><p>not steal they destroyed. They laughed at </p><p>justice. They flouted mercy. Their cruelty </p><p>was that of the tyrant who has once been a </p><p>slave. </p><p> The inhabitants were patient, but they</p><p>were also human. When they could stand </p><p>no more, they formed a Comite dcs Vigi- </p><p>lantes, with which to purge the offices of </p><p>their parish. In less than one week the </p><p>carpet baggers had been driven into the </p><p>cypress islands of the outlying sea-marsh. </p><p> “Biensaid the Vigilantes, and returned</p><p>to their farms, but their work had only just </p><p>begun. From fugitives, the carpet baggers </p><p>developed quite frankly into outlaws. Under </p><p>the leadership of a brave, resourceful man, </p><p>who on account of his fierceness was called </p><p>Le Sauvage, they emerged from their </p><p>cypress islands to harry the country far and </p><p>wide. And as these islands, flanked by a </p><p>barren and treacherous marsh, were well- </p><p>nigh impregnable, the Vigilantes found it </p><p>very hard to retaliate. </p><p> Now more than ever was it a time of</p><p>disaster. The inhabitants, immune from </p><p>the four years’ struggle, found themselves </p><p> suddenly plunged into a mimic war of their</p><p> own. Backed by their redoubtable leader,</p><p> the outlaws fought like fiends. Each honest</p><p> man was expected to take down his gun and</p><p> join the ranks of the Vigilantes.</p><p> Madame Gerac, however, was of a differ-</p><p> ent opinion. She insisted that Louis and</p><p> Paul should stay upon the farm.</p><p> “No,” she said, when the young men</p><p> came to her. “It is all right to be a hero,</p><p> but what about the plowing? For the pres-</p><p> ent, mes enfants, you must content your-</p><p> selves with fighting the battle of life.”"</p><p> And despite the troubled times, Madame</p><p> Gerac’s action was not criticized. She had</p><p> struggled hard, and it seemed only fair that</p><p> her children should be left for her protection</p><p> and support.</p><p> “Justice to Madame Justice,” said the</p><p> neighbors, as they had already begun to</p><p> call her.</p><p> As for the young men, they accepted this</p><p> restraint according to their natures. Paul,</p><p> slow, methodical and obliging, resigned</p><p> himself quite calmly to the wishes of his</p><p> foster mother. He would like to fight, he</p><p> said, if only as a proof of his good inten-</p><p> tions. His duty, though, must come before</p><p> liis desire.</p><p> Louis showed more impatience. He was</p><p> young, handsome and dashing. It was his</p><p> one desire in life to cut a figure. Each</p><p> fight, each tale of personal bravery but</p><p> served to increase his discontentment. His</p><p> mother was mad—selfishly mad, he said.</p><p> She could not expect to "treat him like a</p><p> child. Very well, he would show her.</p><p> And show her he did upon the first oppor- '</p><p> t unity.</p><p>IT OCCURRED *t the very </p><p>height of the struggle, at a time </p><p>when, accompanied by a band of </p><p>picked horsemen, Le Sauvage was scounnng </p><p>the country as with fire. He struck and </p><p>escaped with the swiftness of lightning. </p><p>None knew where next his hand would fall </p><p>His scouts patrolled each road. </p><p> One afternoon, as they were returning</p><p> •rom work, Louis and Paul discovered one</p><p> of these scouts. The outlaw sat on his</p><p> horse in the security of a small clump of</p><p> brush, and, as was the custom in those</p><p> days, each of the young men was armed.</p><p> At sight of the scout, Louis drew hi? foster</p><p>brother down into the cover of the tall </p><p>grass. </p><p>174 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “You saw?” he whispered excitedly. "It</p><p> is what I Lave been waiting for. Now we</p><p> will show them whether we are men or not.</p><p> If we lie Hat and crawl, we can approach</p><p> unseen within easy range.”</p><p> “But why shoot him?” objected the less</p><p> excitable Paul. “We are not Vigilantes,</p><p> and he has as yet done us no harm. Trouble</p><p> will come of it, you may be sure.”</p><p> But Louis was not to be deterred from</p><p> this opportunity of proving himself a man.</p><p> “You are afraid, Paul,” he sneered.</p><p> “Very well, then. I will bear the responsi-</p><p> bility alone.” And, putting his words into</p><p> effect, he began to crawl away.</p><p> Paul thought for a moment and then fol-</p><p> lowed him.</p><p> “Bien,” said he. “If you are determined,</p><p> I will go with you. It is only right that we</p><p> should stand together in the matter.”</p><p> They shot the outlaw from close range,</p><p> firing together. The man, instantly killed,</p><p> toppled from his horse without a sound.</p><p> The silence, the simplicity of his death, was</p><p> in some way terrifying to the young men.</p><p> Had the outlaw screamed, had he strug-</p><p> gled, it is probable that they would have</p><p> rushed forward to finish him. As it was,</p><p> they fled panic-stricken to their home.</p><p> Thus they failed to notice a second out-</p><p> law who had been stationed a little way be-</p><p> yond his companion. This second outlaw</p><p> saw the two in their flight, but he did not</p><p> pursue them. Instead he galloped off to</p><p> report to his leader. Le Sauvage had a</p><p> fondness for attending to such matters in</p><p> his own way.</p><p> That night the young men made no men-</p><p> tion of their deed to Madame Gerac. Paul,</p><p> if troubled, w-as calm. Louis sought unsuc-</p><p> cessfully to hide a nervous fear. After sup-</p><p> per, making some excuse, both went out to</p><p> confer with a distant neighbor. When they</p><p> returned Madame Gerac noticed that their</p><p> clothes were stained with fresh earth. After-</p><p> w’ard it was discovered that, following the</p><p> neighbor’s advice, they had put the dead</p><p> outlaw under ground.</p><p> It was perhaps half an hour after the</p><p> young men had departed for their work the</p><p> following morning, that a body of horsemen</p><p> rode up to the door of the farmhouse. At</p><p> their head was the huge, forbidding man</p><p> whose name was a synonym for terror. ^ et,</p><p> cruel and relentless though he was, Le</p><p> Sauvace—who had once been a gentleman—</p><p> was justly renowned for his courtesy to</p><p>w'omen. Dismounting now, lie stepped up </p><p>to the door, removing his hat as he knocked </p><p>upon it. </p><p> Madame Gerac opened to him at once.</p><p>She had seen the outlaws from a distance,</p><p>yet she made no attempt to escape. In- </p><p>deed, if she felt any fear, it was most suc- </p><p>cessfully hidden. The day w'as bright and </p><p>warm, and already the blinds had been </p><p>drawn against the approaching glare. Ma- </p><p>dame Gerac only shaded her eyes with one </p><p>hand, as is the custom of farm women when </p><p>receiving a visitor. </p><p> Le Sauvage bow-ed low'.</p><p> “You are Madame Justice?” he inquired.</p><p> “I am Madame Gerac,” she returned.</p><p>“If they speak of me as Madame Justice, </p><p>that is no affair of mine.” </p><p> “And yet,” said Le Sauvage, “if I may do</p><p>so without offense, I should prefer to call </p><p>you by the latter name. It will be more ap- </p><p>propriate in view of what I have to say.” </p><p> “As you please, m’sieu,” agreed Madame</p><p>Gerac.* “And now for your business.” </p><p> “To begin with, madame,” said Le Sal-</p><p>vage, “I have always admired the reports </p><p>of your justice. To this admiration you </p><p>may attribute the security, thus far. of </p><p>your home and family. Indeed it is prob- </p><p>able that, with all things equal, you might </p><p>have continued immune from my wrath. </p><p>Yesterday, however, your sons broke our </p><p>tacit truce. From ambush, and for no ap- </p><p>parent reason, they killed one of my men. </p><p>This man, sitting quietly upon his horse, </p><p>was harming no earthly thing. Firing </p><p>together, your sons shot him down like a </p><p>dog- </p><p> “Now' this, madame, places me in an un-</p><p>fortunate position. Had your sons been </p><p>Vigilantes I might, for your sake, have </p><p>charged their deed to my general account </p><p>against that organization. As it is, I cannot </p><p>overlook the affair. My men must be pro- </p><p>tected. I cannot have them tired upon </p><p>unfairly by even’ farm lad who wishes to </p><p>distinguish himself. </p><p> “So there is my case, which I contend is</p><p>plainly one of deliberate and unwarranted </p><p>assassination. I now have the honor of ask- </p><p>ing vou, Madame Justice, to pass upon it. </p><p> A long minute passed during which Ma-</p><p>dame Gerac stood, as though frozen, in her </p><p>doorwav. Not for one instant did she doubt </p><p>the truth of the outlaw’s accusation. In </p><p>the first place, Le Sauvage did not lie. in </p><p>the second, she had heard the shots the </p><p>Madame Justice </p><p>175 </p><p>afternoon before, she had noticed the nerv- </p><p>ousness of her son. </p><p> ‘ Come, madame,” urged Le Sauvage.</p><p>“I regret ray necessity, but there is little</p><p>time.’' </p><p> Before she could speak Madame Gerac</p><p>was forced to moisten her lips with the tip </p><p>of her tongue. </p><p> “I have tried to lie to you, m’sieu, and</p><p>I find that I can not,” said she steadily. </p><p>“Your case is indeed a strong one.” </p><p> Le Sauvage waited for something else</p><p>and, when it did not come, he uttered a </p><p>growl of admiration. </p><p> “Dieu, madame!” he cried. “You more</p><p>then fulfil the reports of you. I so seldom </p><p>run across your kind that I am going to </p><p>mark the event by an unexpected act. I </p><p>had come here fully determined to kill both </p><p>of your sons and destroy your home. One </p><p>falsehood from you, one plea for two guilty </p><p>men, and I would have done so. But you </p><p>have kept faith with your reputation, and </p><p>I, who also am accounted just, will keep </p><p>faith with mine. </p><p> “We have ridden through the night, and</p><p>our horses are tired. Below’ us there is a </p><p>wood. We will rest in that w’ood for one </p><p>hour. From your two sons you will choose </p><p>one to stand before my rifles. I will accept </p><p>a life for a life, an execution for an assassina- </p><p>tion. Surely that is fair enough?” </p><p> Madame Gerac could not reply. She</p><p>could only bow her head. </p><p> Again Le Sauvage bowed low.</p><p>^ ''Adieu then, Madame Justice,” said he. </p><p>‘‘Remember, we will wait but the hour. </p><p>And let me warn you against any tricks. </p><p>Our horses, though weary, are swift, and the </p><p>V	igilantes are twenty miles away. Should</p><p>I be forccd to return, it will be to carry out </p><p>my original intention.” </p><p>FOR a little while after the outlaws </p><p>had gone, Madame Gerac continued </p><p>to stand in her doorway. Strangely </p><p>enough, her first feeling was not so much </p><p>one of grief as of disappointment. She </p><p>stared out at the dilapidated buildings, the </p><p>low, unprofitable fields, the fewr poor head </p><p>of stock. Howshe had worked, and planned, </p><p>and contrived, to keep it all together! It </p><p>was what she had hoped to leave her son. </p><p>She had toiled with this one end in view. </p><p>And now, perhaps— With the thought </p><p>temptation came knocking at her motlur- </p><p>neart. </p><p> Her children knew nothing of the visit of</p><p> Le Sauvage. She had but to call them in,</p><p> to dispatch Paul upon some pretended</p><p> errand to the wood, and the matter would</p><p> be ended. Or, again, she might even con-</p><p> clude the affair without deceit. She could</p><p> call Paul alone, she could tell him of the</p><p> dreadful dilemma. That he would go with-</p><p> out question or complaint she knew well.</p><p> He was that kind.</p><p> But she w'as also her kind. She was Ma-</p><p> dame Justice.</p><p> Slowly, resolute!)’, Madame Gerac re-</p><p>crossed the threshold of her home. Before </p><p>her a short passage led back to the kitchen. </p><p>Half way down this passage she Had put </p><p>temptation behind her. She arrived at </p><p>her decision with her hand upon the kitchen </p><p>door. </p><p> Once inside the kitchen, Madame Gerac</p><p>acted quickly. Going straight to the shelf </p><p>above the open fire, she took from it a pack </p><p>of cards. It w^as an old pack, soiled and </p><p>thumbed from the handling of many games. </p><p>Placing the pack upon the kitchen table, </p><p>she took from its nail the battered tin horn </p><p>with wiiich she was wont to call in her chil- </p><p>dren. She was forced to blow' thrice before </p><p>she could produce a sound. </p><p> When the young men arrived, Madame</p><p>Gerac wasted little time. She called to </p><p>them when they were still some distance </p><p>from the kitchen doorway. </p><p> “Quick, you two!” she began. “You</p><p>killed an outlaw from ambush yesterday </p><p>afternoon?” </p><p> Louis stopped instantly. His face grew</p><p> deathly white, and his knees began to bend</p><p> under him. Paul plodded doggedlv forward.</p><p> His eyes were troubled, but when he spoke</p><p> his voice was steady enough.</p><p> “Yes, mother,” he replied, as he had been</p><p> taught to call her.</p><p> “You shot together—at the same time?”</p><p> “Yes, mother.”</p><p> “The man was not harming vou—he</p><p>made no threatening movement?” </p><p> “No, mother.”</p><p> Madame Gerac frowned. Evidentlv</p><p>something was puzzling her. </p><p> “But why?” she continued. “I can</p><p>understand such a thing from Louis. He, </p><p>of course, wished to prove himself a man </p><p>But you, Paul—you are not accustomed to </p><p>play the fool. Come, wThy did you do it?” </p><p> Paul s mouth closed detcrminedlv. Louis</p><p> crept forward, his eyes appealing. Madame</p><p>m </p><p>176 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Gerac, however, knew her children only too </p><p>well. </p><p> “I see,” said she. “Louis insisted, und</p><p>you thought it your duty to stand with him</p><p>in the matter. Nevertheless you were a </p><p>fool, Paul. Le Sauvage has been here. </p><p>Also he has been just. Only one of you </p><p>will have to pay. He has promised to wait </p><p>an hour in the wood for the one to come to </p><p>him. After that it will be both. Also the </p><p>house. He has told me to choose between </p><p>you, but I can not. You will have to deter- </p><p>mine the choice yourselves.” </p><p> Paul nodded quietly.</p><p> “jBien/’ said he. “Then I shall go,</p><p>mother. It will be better for you that way. </p><p>It will-” </p><p> Madame Gerac did not falter.</p><p> “You will do nothing of the sort, Paul,”</p><p>she interrupted firmly. “The guilt is equal </p><p>between you. The punishment must be </p><p>left to chance. Inside I have placed the </p><p>cards in readiness upon the table. You will </p><p>each cut, and the one who shows the lowest </p><p>card will go. Come, there is no time to </p><p>lose.” </p><p> She turned and re-entered the kitchen,</p><p>with Paul following close behind her. </p><p> Louis followed more slowly. Dazed,</p><p>stupefied by fear, he had thus far been un- </p><p>able to utter the excuses, the entreaties, </p><p>that rose to his lips. Had it not been for </p><p>this stupefaction, it is probable that he </p><p>would then have tried to make his escape. </p><p>As it was, his paralyzed limbs seemed to </p><p>carry him unwillingly forward. Slowly, and </p><p>with wide, staring eyes, like one in a dream, </p><p>he made his way into the kitchen and took </p><p>his place at the table beside Paul. </p><p> Madame Gerac did not look at her son at</p><p>this moment. There were some things that </p><p>even she could not stand. </p><p> “You will cut first, Louis, since it was</p><p>you who suggested the deed,” said she. </p><p>“Afterward you will wait for Paul. You </p><p>will then turn up your cards together.” </p><p>Dazedly, mechanically, Louis reached </p><p>over and removed a part of the pack. After </p><p>he had done so his hand fell heavily to his </p><p>side, the fingers fumbling nervously at the </p><p>cards. Paul cut quickly but carefully, stay- </p><p>ing his hand a little way above the pack. As </p><p>if warned by some hidden sense, Madame </p><p>Gerac faced about. </p><p> Paul, without a tremor, turned up his</p><p>cut disclosing a ten of clubs. Louis, with </p><p>shaking hand, displayed a king of hearts. </p><p>Madame Gerac expelled her breath in a </p><p>long sigh, half of horror, half of relief. </p><p> As was his custom Paul had, upon coming</p><p>inside, removed his hat. Now, replacing </p><p>liis cards, he reached out for it. With his</p><p>hand upon the brim he paused. </p><p> “What is the use?” he asked himself.</p><p> But a moment later he picked up the hat.</p><p>It was the triumph of habit. </p><p> Madame Gerac had never been a demon-</p><p>strative woman. When Paul came over to </p><p>her, she only kissed him upon the forehead. </p><p> “Farewell, Paul,” said she. “You have</p><p>been a good son to me.” </p><p> “Farewell, mother,” replied Paul, and</p><p>turned to his foster brother. </p><p> Louis stood motionless, although he also</p><p>had replaced his cards. Paul hefd out hi </p><p>hand. There seemed nothing that he could </p><p>say. As the two clasped silently. Madame </p><p>Gerac again turned away her head. </p><p> When Madame Gerac looked around a</p><p>moment later, Paul was gone. Louis still </p><p>stood in his same position, although no </p><p>with his body bent, he was reaching down </p><p>toward the floor. At his mother’s glance </p><p>he straightened up quickly, furtively. A </p><p>sudden rush of color surged into his face, </p><p>and his eyes exchanged their terror for a </p><p>look of sullen shame. </p><p> There was no deceiving Madame Gerac</p><p>in the matter of her children. She knew </p><p>their every mood. Not for one moment </p><p>had she sought to blind herself to the evi- </p><p>dent cowardice of her son. Now that he was </p><p>safe, however, it was hardly natural that </p><p>he should have the appearance of a whipped </p><p>dog. </p><p> Slowly, mercilessly, Madame Gerac raked</p><p>her son with her gaze, noting the flushed </p><p>cheeks, the furtive eyes, the sullen mouth. </p><p>Then, as she looked below the level of his </p><p>waist, her lips suddenly tightened. That </p><p>right leg, why was it held so rigidly.'' That </p><p>right foot, why was it planted with so much </p><p>firmness? And whence came that dull </p><p>glint of white beneath the tight-pressed </p><p>heel? </p><p> With one, swift movement Madame</p><p>Gerac was at her son’s side. With another </p><p>she had thrust him away. Then, stooping, </p><p>she picked up the card. It was a deuce of </p><p>spades, grimy and tom. and marked now </p><p>with the crescent-like impression of a heel. </p><p> “Dieut” gasped Madame Gerac, and</p><p>groped blindly for a chair. </p><p> After she had sunk into it she regained</p><p>Madame Justice </p><p>177 </p><p>control of herself. Her eyes flashed as she </p><p>held up the card. </p><p>“Explain!” she cried in a dreadful voice. </p><p>Louis knew that tone. It was one that</p><p>could not be denied. Trembling, sobbing, </p><p>he fell upon his knees at his mother’s side, </p><p>burying his face in her lap. </p><p> “Forgive me, mother, forgive me,” he</p><p>pleaded. “I could not go. I wanted so to </p><p>live. With Paul it was different. He </p><p>offered himself at the first. He knew-” </p><p> “Explain!” cried Madame Gerac. “Ex-</p><p>plain before it is too late.” </p><p> “It was after I had cut,” sobbed Louis.</p><p>“I was holding the cards at my side. I knew </p><p>the pack well, I had noticed that the deuce </p><p>was torn. When I felt the tear I dropped </p><p>the deuce to the floor, and set my heel upon </p><p>it. I had no idea of what the next card </p><p>would be. I swear to you that I did not </p><p>know it was a king. It was only a small ad- </p><p>vantage, and I took it, well knowing that </p><p>Paul was willing to go.” </p><p> For just one moment Madame Gerac</p><p>permitted her hand to rest upon the bowed </p><p>head of her son. </p><p> “My poor Louis,” she murmured, half in</p><p>pity, half in contempt. </p><p> Then she rose quickly to her feet.</p><p>“Come!” said she. “You may yet be in </p><p>time.” </p><p> Louis shrank back. The color drained</p><p>from his face, leaving it white again. Small </p><p>dots of perspiration appeared upon his brow. </p><p> “Mother! Mother!” he gasped. “You</p><p>can not mean it.” </p><p> “Come!” repeated Madame Gerac. This</p><p>time it was a command. </p><p> Louis crouched behind the table. He was</p><p>like a rat in a trap. His lips curled threaten- </p><p>ingly, and an ugly light came into his eyes. </p><p> “I will not go, I tell you,” he snarled.</p><p>“My life is my own. You had best take </p><p>care, even though you are my mother.’ </p><p>Madame Gerac gave him not so much as </p><p>a glance. Instead she sprang to the comer </p><p>where, upon coming inside, the young men </p><p>had leaned their weapons. An instant </p><p>later she had whirled about, gun in hand. </p><p> “Quick, Louis!” she demanded. “Shall</p><p>it be here or there? You have lost, have </p><p>you not? Then you will pay me, or you </p><p>will pay Le Sauvage, or, if you are too late, </p><p>you will pay Paul.” </p><p>12 </p><p> She advanced upon him suddenly, forcing</p><p>him toward the door. </p><p> “DieuI” she burst out as she drove him</p><p>through it. “It is bad enough for you to be </p><p>a coward, although I can stand that. But </p><p>to be dishonest—no.” </p><p> And she added as she hurried him for-</p><p>ward: </p><p> “Do not try what is in your mind. I</p><p>shall not allow you to escape. If you take </p><p>to your heels, you will not get a dozen </p><p>yards.” </p><p>1 IT WAS a strange pair that went </p><p>9 down toward the wood—the son </p><p>stumbling along before, his eyes </p><p>wild, his lips babbling forth an unheeded </p><p>stream of supplication, the mother stalking </p><p>grimly behind, her gun thrust forward as a </p><p>goad, her face a mask of silent agony. One </p><p>glance she gave along the path that sepa- </p><p>rated the farm from the wood, only to lind </p><p>it empty. Although but little time had </p><p>elapsed since the cutting of the cards. Paul </p><p>had already disappeared beyond the line of </p><p>trees. </p><p> “Faster!” ordered Madame Gerac, quick-</p><p>ening her pace. Louis, looking back into </p><p>the muzzle of the gun, broke into a long, </p><p>shuffling stride. </p><p> When they were some fifty yards from</p><p>their goal, a brisk sound of riile fire rattled </p><p>out from among the trees. Madame Gerac </p><p>paused as abruptly as if it were she who </p><p>had been shot. Lowering her gun she </p><p>made the sign of the cross. </p><p> Louis paused also, but only for an instant.</p><p>With the first crash of the volley he had </p><p>made" up his mind. Before him lay certain </p><p>death. Behind, it might not be so sure. </p><p>After all, she was his mother. Perhaps, </p><p>for the first time, she might not live up to </p><p>her word. </p><p> As Louis, bending low, ran for his life,</p><p>Madame Gerac raised her gun. She was a </p><p>most excellent shot. She did not hesitate. </p><p>AND so, gaunt, silent, and tragic, </p><p>Madame Gerac comes each year to </p><p>Landry\ Always it is upon the da\r </p><p>before her anniversary, and always she </p><p>brings money for a mass. Also, the village- </p><p>folk inform me, she is impartial to the end. </p><p>Always the mass is for the two. </p><p>I </p><p>FURRINERf </p><p>Harold Tittaj </p><p>Author of “An Event.” </p><p> T WAS no fight. Neither—</p><p>knowing “Baldy” Brown—was it </p><p>the sickening triumph of a bully. </p><p>It was just a natural reaction, </p><p>only the inevitable boiling-over of that spirit </p><p>which was once so typical but which is now </p><p>ebbing so rapidly from Michigan lumber- </p><p>camps: the popping of a safety-valve, which </p><p>resulted in bruised faces and battered bod-</p><p>ies. minor results compared to what might </p><p>have happened had there been no outlet </p><p>before the emotion gained that strength at </p><p>which it would burst all bonds. </p><p> He went from one end of the bunk-house</p><p>to the other, roaring as a storm, flinging his </p><p>thick arms with the vigor of drive-rods, de- </p><p>molishing with a final swing the crude chair </p><p>that had put three of them flat; kicking, </p><p>clutching, striking, swearing. And they </p><p>scurried from him, those Slavs. Not one </p><p>of them wanted to stand, so those who were </p><p>bruised and beaten were only the ones who </p><p>tarried too long in his path. </p><p> Such men could give no battle to Baldy</p><p>Brown, with his six foot three and his two </p><p>hundred ten—all lithe, pliable muscle on </p><p>sturdy bone—and his woods training. A </p><p>blow, sometimes two, at the most three, </p><p>sufficed; they were whipped in a breath. </p><p>And he roared his way onward, daring them </p><p>to stand. </p><p> So. I repeat, it was no fight.</p><p> They were foreigners, and the first of their</p><p>kind with whom Baldy Brown had ever been </p><p>forced to work. Up there on the south </p><p>shore European labor was making its initial </p><p>appearance in lumber-camps, marking the </p><p>final passing of that swashbuckling clan </p><p>which lent romance to the devastation of </p><p>forests. And Baldy, one of the last of his </p><p>kind, could not bear it. </p><p> He had stood much in his time; stood the</p><p>coming of a milder breed of bosses, the go- </p><p>ing on of scores of companions, the arrival </p><p>of a less stanch army of native stock. But </p><p>when they put him to bunk and eat and </p><p>work with foreigners who would not do a </p><p>man’s work and who could not make a man's </p><p>fight—well, something had to break! For </p><p>in the woods a man's capacity for manual </p><p>accomplishment and blow-for-blow con- </p><p>flict is the measure of his value to the race; </p><p>and wo to him who shirks! </p><p> These men shirked and on them Baldy</p><p>Brown, accepted over a hundred-mile radi- </p><p>us as a true woodsman, had breathed his </p><p>damning judgment. </p><p> “Th' furriners!” he’d mutter under his</p><p>breath. “Th’ low-down furriners!” Fail- </p><p>ing in his classification to remember that he </p><p>had toiled and brawled side by side with </p><p>French and Scotch in his hey-days. “They </p><p>ain’t a man among ’em! Furriners!” </p><p> Then the limit; and unprovoked by word</p><p>or look he bellowed his warning and charged </p><p>through them, vision red, finding relief in </p><p>the way he knew. From the tortured soul</p><p>of one man conies a great symphony; from </p><p>another, a master poem or picture; when </p><p>Baldy Brown's innermost being writhed </p><p>there could be no relief other then his knot- </p><p>ted fists meeting flesh. </p><p> Knowing him, then, the affair could not</p><p>be characterized by the spirit of the bully. </p><p>178 </p><p>" Furriners'’ </p><p>179 </p><p> And when he had gone from the farthest</p><p>shadow clear down to the door at the other </p><p>end of the building, Brown turned and </p><p>looked back. From their bunks the half- </p><p>dozen other old-timers laughed indulgently </p><p>at the astounded men of another race-strain </p><p>who cowered from the storm turned on </p><p>them. </p><p> “Furriners!” yelled Baldy Brown in a</p><p>voice choked with honest rage. “Furrin- </p><p>ers! Ain’t they a man among yez? Won’t </p><p>one o’ yez please stand up an’ hit me, so I </p><p>can kill him?” </p><p> He took a half-dozen steps toward them</p><p>again and those nearest him stirred, as </p><p>if to retreat. </p><p> “Yeah!” he scoffed, and stopped.</p><p>“Furriners!” </p><p> Then he wheeled, opened the door and</p><p>slammed it behind him, going into the night. </p><p>IT WAS a haggard, bruised Baldy </p><p>Brown who three weeks later awoke </p><p>sober in Cheboygan. He had </p><p>warped memories of a dozen fights in as </p><p>many towns; of nights passed in different </p><p>camps where the presence of alien labor al- </p><p>ways drove him on to another trip by rail </p><p>or rutted road until he came to himself, </p><p>broke, shaken, in the lower peninsula, with </p><p>Winter at its worst. </p><p> But Winter at its worst really meant at its</p><p>best, for logging was on and men like Baldy </p><p>Brown—known by the set of their jaws and </p><p>the swing of their shoulders to every camp- </p><p>boss in the Great Lakes country—are al- </p><p>ways in demand. He hired out in a saloon, </p><p>got a drink and a ticket, and climbed into </p><p>the smoker of the dingy accommodation- </p><p>train which was to worn' its way westward </p><p>through the drifts. </p><p> Of the man who bought his services</p><p>Brown asked but one question, and asked it </p><p>seriously, weightily, confidentially. And </p><p>the other, sizing the big chap up, laughed </p><p>and said hurriedly: </p><p> “Furriners? Aw, th’ crew’s all white.”</p><p>That much settled, Baldy was content to </p><p>sleep and wait until the conductor ordered</p><p>him off. </p><p> It was noon and thawing a bit when he</p><p>stepped out into the snow and struck up the </p><p>road to which he was directed. His heart </p><p>was light, for behind he was leaving bad </p><p>memories. He had little idea of what </p><p>flight await him in this camp on Loon Lake, </p><p>lJut camps are all much alike and he rev- </p><p>eled in the memory of the assurance given </p><p>him that the crew was while. Such was </p><p>sufficient to warm his soul. </p><p> “Here comes a jack" growled the cook</p><p>to the cookee as he saw' Brown swing into </p><p>camp just before dusk. “You can tell ’em </p><p>far*s you can see,” he added a bit grimly. </p><p>For he was an old cook and, too, cherished </p><p>memories of the men who were worthy of </p><p>the grub he set out. </p><p> Baldy sniffed deeply the tainted air of</p><p>the bunks as he shoved open the door and </p><p>stepped into the room. A bit of a senti- </p><p>mentalist was this big-chested son of the </p><p>timber lands, and the odors were good to his </p><p>nostrils. He was glad to be back. He had </p><p>had his drunk; work was before him and in </p><p>the facts he took the joy of the lumber- </p><p>jack. Also, the crew was of white men, </p><p>his breed. It was like a home-coming. </p><p> And the disappointment was doubled</p><p>when the crew came in. He heard and de- </p><p>tected a difference in their voices before the </p><p>door opened. He knew they spoke a for- </p><p>eign tongue and for the instant before rage </p><p>came, the men felt sick at heart. </p><p> But he held his peace and kept the dis-</p><p>gust to himself. Something of a fatalist, </p><p>perhaps, was in him. Anyhow, he held his </p><p>gaze to his plate at supper, went to his </p><p>bunk from the table and, putting his face </p><p>close to the log wall, muttered contemptu- </p><p>ously as sleep came: </p><p> “Furriners! They ain't—white!”</p><p> BALDY, for reasons unknown to</p><p>himself, tried to forget the situation. </p><p>The boss put him top-loading and he </p><p>labored lustily throughout the day, think- </p><p>ing of the near future when his muscles </p><p>would be right again and he could hit the old </p><p>killing pace. It was good to be at work, </p><p>handling tackle, seeing things move, in </p><p>spite of the fact that the old energy which </p><p>used to accomplish the big things in logging- </p><p>camps was not in evidence. </p><p> At night he was silent again, and again</p><p>under blankets before the whole crew had </p><p>finished eating. He was facing the inevi- </p><p>table, he began to understand. Foreigners </p><p>had come to stay, were penetrating even,’</p><p>corner of the woods. It made him restless, </p><p>with a species of homesickness, and the </p><p>realization took from him for the moment </p><p>that lust to break and maim, made him </p><p>gentler in a morose sort of way. Incentive </p><p>to fight comes only with having men to whip. </p><p>i So </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Baldy followed the bent of old cus-</p><p>toms, established when bosses did not drive </p><p>men in lumber-camps but busied themselves </p><p>in search of tasks for the work-gluttons who </p><p>toiled in the crews. The same condition </p><p>that had made him revolt up there in the </p><p>Superior country prevailed here. The crew </p><p>lagged, had to be pushed from start to quit- </p><p>ting time. Not a man of them took pride </p><p>in his work; not a stroke was made in heal- </p><p>thy competition; their final object was to </p><p>remain on the pay-roll. </p><p> But Brown’s example went for nothing.</p><p>A handful of younger natives saw and ad- </p><p>mitted his prowess in a Listless sort of way. </p><p>That hurt him, but not with the sting en- </p><p>gendered by the utter indifference of the </p><p>Poles who made up the bulk of the crew. </p><p> Worse than the failure to inspire effort in</p><p>those about him was the fact that their </p><p>slovenly progress made it impossible for </p><p>the big fellow to maintain his regular pace. </p><p>Teamsters were slow, others bungled. He </p><p>could work like the furies for thirty min- </p><p>utes, perhaps, then wait for something to </p><p>do. It was exasperating, indeed! </p><p> “They won’t light; they won’t work!</p><p>They ain’t men!” he muttered over and </p><p>over. </p><p> He'd have laughed, then, had any one</p><p>told him that perhaps down in those men </p><p>was the spark waiting to be touched and </p><p>bring out their vigor. That would have </p><p>been beyond his comprehension. He could </p><p>see things only in his way—which is a fault </p><p>of many big men. </p><p> One little Pole, a teamster, was a particu-</p><p>lar irritant to Baldy Brown. He was small, </p><p>he was quiet, he was timid and slow, and </p><p>could not stand the cold. </p><p> “Yez can’t even raise hair on yer face!”</p><p>Brown cried the first time his temper rose </p><p>above control, and flung a scornful gesture </p><p>at the diminutive teamster whose thin, </p><p>blood mustache held two tiny icicles. </p><p> And so malevolent was his glaring that</p><p>the Slav winced as from a blow and looked </p><p>over his shoulder with concern as he drove </p><p>away. </p><p> From then on Baldy’s outbursts were</p><p>frequent, and with each tirade the evident </p><p>fear of the Poles mounted. The situation </p><p>became almost like that of a wolf threaten- </p><p>ing sheep—the way they drew together and </p><p>listened mutely while he swore and threat- </p><p>ened. </p><p> “Yez ain’t men!" he would chant. “ They</p><p>ain't a day’s work or a fight in yez! Yez </p><p>ain’t men!” </p><p> The little teamster with the puny mus-</p><p>tache was a particular mark for Brown s </p><p>abuse. 1 hey laced one another at table </p><p>and the big top-loader glared such hate that </p><p>the other was frigthened out of eating: they </p><p>met in the bunk-house and Baldy raised </p><p>both hands slowly as if to crush the </p><p>Pole with his bodily weight, but stopped </p><p>the movement with a taunting laugh as the </p><p>little chap slunk away. </p><p> Yes, it was bullying then. Not the bully-</p><p>ing of one man, not the singling out of him </p><p>because he was small. But because he </p><p>typified, to Brown, all that was disgusting </p><p>about his kind and because the spleen which </p><p>grew in the lumber-jack there among the </p><p>men from across salt water must find a vent. </p><p> “Furriners, yez!” he shouted from his</p><p>bunk one night and shut a sudden silence </p><p>on the room. “No grit an’ no work in yez! </p><p>Yez can’t learn nothin'—can’t learn to </p><p>work! Furriners!’' </p><p> Then he flopped back into the shadows</p><p>and tossed through a short night. </p><p> THEY awoke to a forty-below</p><p>morning, with the buildings and </p><p>trees and very dry’ air snapping and </p><p>booming in complaint, while the long, ripping </p><p>screeches of the frozen lake gave stronger </p><p>effect to the symphony of extreme tempera- </p><p>ture. But Baldy Brown’s temper was not </p><p>chilled. _ It glared at white- heat and as he </p><p>hung low over his plate at breakfast a ma- </p><p>licious gaze roved up and down the row of </p><p>faces before him, while his fingers clenched ( </p><p>with a vicious grip the handle of his knife. </p><p> Just the sounds of feeding. Not a spoken</p><p>w’ord, as is the rule at camp meals. So it </p><p>was more than astonishing when he sprang </p><p>to his feet, rested both hands on the edge </p><p>of the table, leaned far forward and, measur- </p><p>ing the words to let them sink in, bellowed: </p><p>“Yez can’t work, yez can't fight, yez </p><p>can’t learn! Ain’t they a furriner among </p><p>yez who’ll fight me—wit’ five more to help </p><p>him?” He shook his fist at the little team- </p><p>ster. “Ain't they twenty? I’ll bust yer </p><p>heads for yez, I’ll do that! An I 11 thank </p><p>yez fer tryin' to kill me!</p><p>“Naw—they ain't furriners enough in th </p><p>world to jump a white man! Yez don t </p><p>know how—an’ yez can't learn—fWthin </p><p>And of course, after that outburst there </p><p>was only one thing to do. With his check j </p><p>“Furriners” </p><p>181 </p><p>in his pocket Baldy sat by the bunk-house </p><p>stove and waited for daylight, muttering to </p><p>himself and moving his big feet restlessly. </p><p> “It’s hard,” he told the cook as he but-</p><p>toned his mackinaw and started for the </p><p>door. “A man can’t find a camp where he </p><p>can do a day’s work. I don’t want to quit </p><p>but what you goin’ to do? Huh? Furrin- </p><p>ers! </p><p> “A man can’t find a camp where it’s fit to</p><p>live!” he flung over his shoulder as he set out </p><p>into the tingling morning, off through the </p><p>strip of timber to the edge of the lake where </p><p>the road crossed a mile-wide arm on fifteen </p><p>inches of ice. </p><p> Baldy’s heart was heavy as he went</p><p>along, swinging his arms now and then to </p><p>keep the blood going. He did not mind </p><p>forty below; that was a part of his life. </p><p>But for the first time in his experience he </p><p>was knowing sorrow; not because he was </p><p>out of a job and headed nowhere, for that, </p><p>too, was part of his life, but because, for all </p><p>he knew, there was not a camp between </p><p>him and Superior where he could find a crew </p><p>of natives. And if he could not find a </p><p>camp, where was he to go? He felt evicted. </p><p> The sensations he experienced kept his</p><p>eyes on the snow before him so he did not </p><p>see the gray team approaching across the </p><p>level lake surface when he stepped out of the </p><p>timber. He was wondering what he would </p><p>do when he had covered the dozen miles to </p><p>the railroad station. And after arriving </p><p>at the conclusion that he had not a plan to </p><p>his name, his gaze went up, out across the </p><p>white lake canopied by the fog of frost </p><p>particles through which the sunlight strug- </p><p>gled. He saw the grays, then; and saw </p><p>the driver walking beside them to keep </p><p>from freezing. His step faltered and the </p><p>fingers within the thick mitten clenched. </p><p>For it was the one gray team of the camp </p><p>and the teamster was the little Pole! </p><p> “Th’ furriner!” he said aloud and quick-</p><p>ened his pace—just to take one good part- </p><p>ing paste at the little man. </p><p> It was much too cold for riding, so the</p><p>Pole had dropped from his load and trudged </p><p>beside the sleigh. The grays strained </p><p>against the friction that frost makes when</p><p>two thousand feet of hardwood bear down </p><p>0n the runners, and their progress was slow. </p><p>Still, in his heavy clothing, it was an effort </p><p>lor the walker to keep up. </p><p> The team gave him no concern. They</p><p>Would obey at a word. But after every </p><p>few steps his eyes sought a rope which was </p><p>flung over the top of the load and ran down </p><p>to the pole. That was the trip-rope to his </p><p>gooseneck. A gooseneck is a contrivance </p><p>to which the eveners are attached; a jerk </p><p>from the rope will release it and set the </p><p>horses free. It is an essential where heavy </p><p>hauls are made across ice, for even the best </p><p>ice will fail at times, logs settle deep into </p><p>the water and unless the horses are freed </p><p>they will be dragged to a drowning with a </p><p>rapidity that is horrible. </p><p>THE Pole had felt uncomfortable </p><p>about that trip-rope ever since the </p><p>grays settled to the pull across the </p><p>lake; perhaps it was premonition. But </p><p>even had the hemp been in his hands it </p><p>might have availed no tiling, because the </p><p>load went through without so much as a </p><p>crackle of warning, his footing tilted sharp- </p><p>ly and he was flung heavily to his side, then </p><p>doused as water sloshed over the broken </p><p>ice cakes. </p><p> The horses grunted and scrambled for</p><p>footing, but all the power they could bring </p><p>to bear was as a whiff of nothing against the </p><p>tug from behind and they went backward </p><p>and down, snorting with fear. </p><p> From afar Baldv Brown saw' the load</p><p>settle and knew what it meant. His ma- </p><p>licious motive was forgotten with the same </p><p>abruptness that his feet took up the mo- </p><p>tions of running. For horses were through </p><p>the ice and it needed a man to get them out! </p><p>As he ran he felt the hot scorn for foreigners </p><p>w’ell up. A man should be with that team! </p><p> Buf his scornful expletives ceased and he</p><p>muttered astonishment at what he saw. </p><p>He could not hear the Pole's cry of fright </p><p>as the ice gave and put him off his balance. </p><p>But he did see the little fellow roll over, </p><p>drag a leg from the grip two blocks of ice </p><p>had clamped on it, stumble to his feet and </p><p>pitch forward again as the settling load </p><p>careened and set his footing heaving. That </p><p>time he went into water! Water that </p><p>smoked when the shriveling air met it! </p><p>And Baldy Brown felt a shiver shoot </p><p>through him as he ran, thinking not of the </p><p>teamster, but of how water would feel on </p><p>human flesh—at forty below! </p><p> Again the little Pole found footing and,</p><p>clothing already beginning to stiffen, sought </p><p>his balance. The team was down, strug- </p><p>gling vainly to keep noses above the broken </p><p>ice which floated, ready to congeal, about </p><p>Adventure </p><p>them. To trip that gooseneck! Such was </p><p>the only way out. </p><p> And lo, as he poised to spring for the</p><p>submerged load and grasp the rope which </p><p>still dangled over the topmost log, he saw </p><p>the line snatched from sight and jerked </p><p>below the surface as a threshing horse’s </p><p>leg tangled with it below. His team was </p><p>fast and the trip-rope gone; his hands were </p><p>already freezing in their soaked gloves. </p><p> He cried out in his native tongue and</p><p>looked wildly about. A man was running </p><p>toward him, but the man was two hundred </p><p>yards away, in heavy clothing and making </p><p>it over snow dry as salt, where feet could </p><p>get no fair hold. The horses would perish </p><p>before that help came. </p><p> The man shook his numbed hands free</p><p>from the stiff gloves and tore open his jacket. </p><p>Then, stooped over on his insecure footing, </p><p>he hesitated an instant before jumping. </p><p> Breath whistled from liim as his body</p><p>plunged into that water, but he did not </p><p>falter. With one senseless hand stuck </p><p>stiffly into the crevice between two logs </p><p>he thrust the other deep down and groped </p><p>for that rope; he worked his legs about in </p><p>the hope they might catch a loop of the line; </p><p>he twisted and turned, fighting off the kill- </p><p>ing chill as the seconds sped, sobbing to him- </p><p>self. His head went under water and ice </p><p>formed in his hair when it came above the </p><p>face. He cried aloud—and the arm that </p><p>had tried to keep him safe lost its hold. He </p><p>sank down, close to the churning heels of </p><p>the grays; then came up battling. In the </p><p>crook of an elbow he clutched the trip-rope! </p><p> “Hold on, yez!” he heard a man cry and</p><p>saw a figure flounder over the ice to the </p><p>load. “Hold yer rope — an’ I’ll get yez </p><p>all!” </p><p> Fingers fastened in the neck of his sweat-</p><p>er and his body was jerked to the submerged </p><p>logs with a vigor of lift that was almost sup- </p><p>erhuman. Then the exquisite torture of </p><p>frost began. </p><p> Big Baldy Brown got the little chap to</p><p>solid ice somehow—he never quite remem- </p><p>bered—and dropped him there. Then he </p><p>yanked lustily at the rope for which the </p><p>Slav had gone into that ice water. </p><p> The horses renewed their threshing as the</p><p>tugs went black and chunks of ice slid from</p><p>their hind quarters as they came close to the </p><p>surface. </p><p> “Choke heem, choke heem! a thin voice</p><p>begged in his ear as Baldy reached for the </p><p>grays' heads from firm footing, and he </p><p>roared back— </p><p> “Choke th’ off one if yez can; I’m gettin'</p><p>this one!” </p><p> He tore a line free, breaking the stout</p><p>leather with what seemed like a half motion, </p><p>looped the strap about the animal’s throat </p><p>and shut down on his windpipe. He held </p><p>the throttling bond there with one hand and </p><p>turned on his side to help with the other, </p><p>heedless even of the strain the frenzied horse </p><p>put against him. </p><p> The Pole moved stiffly, as if his</p><p>parts were of lead. He dragged himself </p><p>close to Baldy and reached out frightened </p><p>hands for the head of the free horse. </p><p> “Look out, yez — you'll fall in agin!”</p><p>the woodsman growled. </p><p> Then together, the one arm of Brown</p><p>working with the two all-but-useless ones </p><p>of the little Pole—they brought another </p><p>rein to bear about that other animal's </p><p>throat. Baldy put the power of his body </p><p>on the straps. </p><p> They did not know the physics of tl</p><p>operation. But they knew that to cut oil </p><p>the breathing of the animals would set </p><p>their bodies floating high and that they </p><p>could be easily pulled to solid ice. Slowly </p><p>the animals choked down and their bodies </p><p>rose to the surface. </p><p> When the other team came up with horses</p><p>on a run and driver swearing his encourage- </p><p>ment from afar Baldy was speechless from </p><p>the cold and the Pole lay motionless, en- </p><p>cased in ice. And by the time the second </p><p>horse had been pulled from the hole, he had </p><p>helped make, to lie breathing in sobs after </p><p>the choking that had saved his life, Baldy </p><p>could utter words only at the cost of an im- </p><p>mense effort. He finally said— </p><p> “Get this—furriner to—camp—quick!”</p><p>They took them both on the same sleigh, </p><p>ministering as they made the short trip. </p><p>The cook, who was wise in the ways of </p><p>frost, turned Baldy over to others hurriedly. </p><p>When he looked'at the Pole he told the </p><p>camp-boss to telephone for a doctor. </p><p> And the cook was looking on late that</p><p>afternoon when Baldy got out of his bun ! </p><p>and made his way to where the little team- </p><p>ster moaned. ,. , </p><p>“’S all ri^ht, Tack!” he heard the big j </p><p>chap say. “’S all right! Nine men out o</p><p>six ’uld ’a’ quit them horses. But you </p><p>didn’t; an’ you’ll get well an’ you ’n me </p><p>show these-— furriners what men is: </p><p> lNNEY, star operative of the</p><p>Secret Service, possessed the </p><p>“camera eye’’ in a measure. </p><p>That is to say, he never forgot a </p><p>face, but unless the face was indissolubly </p><p>connected with some business or social </p><p>event, the operative was apt to forget the </p><p>name of the owner of the face and the time </p><p>and place where he had first seen it. He </p><p>was not at all superhuman or uncanny, this </p><p>man Tenney, nor inquisitive, save in mat- </p><p>ters of routine. Ordinarily a drunken man </p><p>was of slightest interest to Tenney. </p><p> But the man who was buying champagne</p><p>for several other men in a far corner of the </p><p>dining-room wrhere Tenney breakfasted, </p><p>piqued the operative’s curiosity, for the </p><p>face was familiar—he had seen the man </p><p>before. But where? To the waiter serving </p><p>his coffee, Tenney indicated the purchaser of </p><p>the bubbling juice of the grape. </p><p> Who s his Merriness?'' he asked. “I've</p><p>always thought that this was a quiet family </p><p>hotel that’s why I came here. I didn’t </p><p>know you held wine parties at 10 a. m.” </p><p>“Lawd, Mist’ Tenney, we usually don’t,” </p><p>grinned the darkey. “But this yerc gent he </p><p>a|n t makin’ no noise, and he’s spendin' his </p><p>money, and—” the darkey shrugged his </p><p>shoulders— “I dunno who he is, Mist’ </p><p>I enney, but T know what he is—he’s a </p><p>tool with money, and them gents with him </p><p>suyf make a hard try to part the two.” </p><p>.Who are they?” demanded Tenney. </p><p> "Don’t you know ’em, seh? But sho—</p><p>i S3 </p><p>FIGURE/ </p><p>CANT </p><p>Lie </p><p>Ay </p><p>~Arfhur </p><p>Jom err </p><p>E^oche </p><p>Author of "For Bravery” ‘‘The </p><p>Sport of Kings," etc. </p><p>course you don’t!

I can git</p><p> his name from the office.”</p><p> Tenney smiled.</p><p> “No thank you, Sam. I’m not interested.”</p><p> Then he attacked his breakfast as if</p><p>he had forgotten all about the wine-bibber </p><p>in the corner. Yet on his wav out of the </p><p>hotel he stopped at the desk and glanced </p><p>carelessly at the register. Among the </p><p>arrivals of the previous night he saw. in </p><p>sprawling chirographv. the name of Peter </p><p>r irkins, of Washington. Tenney pointed </p><p>at the name. </p><p>“Our champagne friend?” he asked the </p><p>clerk. </p><p> The latter nodded.</p><p>184 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Don’t know how he happened to pick</p><p>a quiet place like this for his party, sir,’' </p><p>apologized the clerk. “But he’s been quiet </p><p>enough, for all his drinking and his friends. </p><p>However—if you object, sir, I II speak to </p><p>the proprietor.” </p><p> “Certainly not,” said Tenney. “Judging</p><p>from his friends he’ll be relieved of his </p><p>money soon, and the hotel of his company.” </p><p>Then, brows wrinkled, Tenney left the </p><p>hotel, for while he did not pride himself </p><p>particularly on his memory, he nevertheless </p><p>knew that when he recognized a face he </p><p>should also recognize the owner's name if </p><p>he saw or heard it. He was certain that </p><p>he knew the face of the wine-bibber. Yet </p><p>in all his wide acquaintance, he had never </p><p>met a man named Peter Firkins. It was </p><p>strange; Tenney might see a man and not </p><p>know his name, yet if the name were men- </p><p>tioned Tenney would always know where </p><p>to place it. Likewise, if a name were men- </p><p>tioned, and a little later Tenney should see </p><p>its owner, even the lapse of many years </p><p>would not cause him hesitation in applying </p><p>the name to the man. </p><p> “I must be getting old,” he told himself.</p><p>“Failing memory is the first sign, I’m told. </p><p>Well—” </p><p> He shrugged his shoulders and hailed a</p><p>cab. In the presence of the important</p><p>message from Dilkes, Chief of the Secret </p><p>Service, which had come to him just before </p><p>breakfast, Tenney could ill afford to fret </p><p>his brain over trivialities. He had dis- </p><p>missed the petty matter from his mind </p><p>when he entered the office of his Chief. </p><p>“Well, Chief,” he said, “you sent word </p><p>that--had broken loose, so as soon as I </p><p>finished breakfast, I-” </p><p> He paused, his eyes suddenly alighting</p><p>upon a third figure in the room, a small </p><p>man, whose lack of stature was emphasized </p><p>by the manner in which he huddled—that’s </p><p>the word—in a huge leather-cushioned arm- </p><p>chair. The face and figure Tenney recog- </p><p>nized at once, and he raised his eyebrows </p><p>inquiringly as he looked at Dilkes; he be- </p><p>came suddenly conscious that the room </p><p>radiated nervous strain. The man in the </p><p>chair lifted burning eyes and looked at </p><p>Tenney. </p><p> “This the man, Chief Dilkes?”</p><p> “This is he,” replied the Chief. “Ten-</p><p>ney, this is the Secretary of War. He’s </p><p>come to me, and I’ve sent for you be- </p><p>cause-- </p><p> The Secretary interrupted.</p><p> “Why did you not come at once, sir?</p><p>Is breakfast more important than—than </p><p>patriotism?” </p><p> Tenney flushed,</p><p> “It’s rather essential, sir, that I come</p><p>prepared. I’m not a health faddist. I </p><p>need breakfast before I do anything. And </p><p>I rather judged from the Chiefs message </p><p>that I'd have to do some thinking.” </p><p> “Thinking?” cried Dilkes. “Acting,</p><p>Tenney! Acting at once! Before the last </p><p>secret of the War Department is given </p><p>away; before the-” </p><p> “Before the United States is laid bare to</p><p>attack which it can not resist,” cried the </p><p>Secretary. “Before treachery, black trea- </p><p>son, has sold away the secrets of our national </p><p>defenses! I dare not even think, tor even </p><p>my thoughts are read, written down and </p><p>sent to the agents of Japan!” </p><p> The Secretary placed his hands before</p><p>his eyes, and a shudder ran the length of </p><p>his body. </p><p> “No one could hear—no one could see—</p><p>there was no signaling—no-” </p><p> Tenney’s muscles stiffened: the lines</p><p>about the mouth hardened, and the nos- </p><p>trils of the strong, pugnacious nose see med </p><p>slightly to flare. </p><p> “Look here, Mr. Secretary," he said,</p><p>“you mustn’t give way. Worry’ gets you</p><p>nothing. Tell me—what’s up?" </p><p> “The plans of the coast defenses of the</p><p>United States are being sold to Japan,’’ </p><p>said the Secretary. </p><p> Tenney whistled.</p><p> “And the seller is-"</p><p> “God alone knows!” ejaculated the</p><p>Secretary. </p><p> “Oh, no,” said Tenney. “The seller</p><p>knows, the buyer knows, and—maybe we'll </p><p>know by and by. Try and tell me ju?t </p><p>what has happened, will you. please? ’ </p><p>There was an easy friendliness in Ten- </p><p>ney’s manner, an absence of flunkyism in </p><p>the presence of the cabinet official, that </p><p>spoke of conscious equality with any one and </p><p>every one. It spoke of more than that </p><p>it spoke of the sane viewpoint that refuses </p><p>to recognize the supernatural in the purely </p><p>physical. It spoke of confidence unmeas- </p><p>ured, which is different from conceit. </p><p> Dilkes used to say that Tenney hyp-</p><p>notized people. Tenney denied the charge. </p><p>“I make ’em come down to earth; that s </p><p>all,” he used to say. </p><p>Figures Can’t Lie </p><p> And in the present instance the Secretary</p><p>came down to earth. The bulk of Tenney, </p><p>the easy voice and colloquial speech were </p><p>as a cool spring in which the cabinet officer </p><p>bathed a burning brain. His eyes seemed </p><p>to cool and liis upper lip ceased twitching. </p><p>y “YOU’LL excuse my losing control </p><p>of myself,” he said, slightly apolo- </p><p>getic, “when I tell you what’s </p><p>happened and the—the impossibility of its </p><p>happening. Last night, in the Washington </p><p>Post-office, a mail-sorter was going over </p><p>the mail. In some way he tore an envelope </p><p>open. He told me that, while unusual, </p><p>such accidents happen once in a while. </p><p>Well, the contents of the envelope fell out </p><p>upon the floor. The sorter picked them up </p><p>to replace them in the envelope. But his </p><p>eye happened to be struck by a typewrit- </p><p>ten line across the top of the first page </p><p>of the contents. And he saw the words, </p><p>‘Copy of plans for southwestern mobiliza- </p><p>tion.’ </p><p> "Mr. Tenney, God was land to the United</p><p>States in seeing that a man of intelligence </p><p>was sorting that particular bunch of mail. </p><p>This mail-sorter is an ambitious man; three </p><p>months ago he took the civil service exami- </p><p>nations for a clerkship in my department. </p><p>He passed, and had already received noti- </p><p>fication that he would enter upon a clerk- </p><p>ship next week.</p><p> “The average mail-sorter would have</p><p>replaced the plans in the envelope, written </p><p>on the latter ‘Opened by mistake,’ and </p><p>Japan would have received the plans, as </p><p>undoubtedly she has been receiving others </p><p>during the past few weeks. </p><p> “But tliis mail-sorter had sense. He</p><p>looked at the address. He saw that the </p><p>plans were addressed to one Itchi Marcy, </p><p>a fruit merchant in this city. He won- </p><p>dered that a Japanese should be receiving </p><p>copies of our military plans. He wondered </p><p>and—late last night he brought the plans </p><p>to me. </p><p> “Mr. Tenney, I was dumbfounded in</p><p>consternation. Listen! The copies which </p><p>the sorter brought to me were exact! Every </p><p>detail of our planned mobilization of the </p><p>troops in the southwest in the event of </p><p>troubles with Mexico were outlined there. </p><p>Vet, Mr. Tenney, the originals of those plans </p><p>were not completed until five o’clock yes- </p><p>terday afternoon. </p><p> “I myself worked over the first draft,</p><p>and when the final draft was completed I </p><p>made changes, in my own handwriting, in </p><p>it. I made those last changes at five </p><p>o’clock. I happen to know, for I heard a </p><p>clock striking at that moment. Now, then, </p><p>in the room with me at the time—my pri- </p><p>vate office in the War Department—were </p><p>just two men: the First Assistant Secretary </p><p>of War, and my stenographer. </p><p> “From two o’clock, when we commenced</p><p>work on the plans, until six, when I locked </p><p>the plans in my safe and left the office, no </p><p>one entered the office, no one left it; no one </p><p>even knocked upon the door. We three </p><p>were absolutely alone. </p><p> “After the plans were completed at five</p><p>o’clock I attended lo other business, and </p><p>it was six, by my own watch, when the </p><p>three of us finally left the office. Yet, Mr. </p><p>Tenney, those plans were mailed to Itcki </p><p>Marcy shortly after five o'clock!" </p><p> “What’s that?” cricd Tenney.</p><p> The Secretary smiled wanly.</p><p> “I thought as you thought—impossible,”</p><p>he said wearily. “But look at this en- </p><p>velope.” </p><p> He passed Tenney the envelope addressed</p><p>to the Japanese fruit merchant. The opera- </p><p>tive looked at the cancellation mark across </p><p>the stamps. Clearly he saw the time </p><p>printed thereon, 5:30 p. m. of the previous </p><p>day. The Secretary sighed. </p><p> “It was midnight,” he resumed, “when</p><p>the mail-sorter brought me tliis envelope.</p><p>My first thought was to have my stenog- </p><p>rapher arrested. I would have done so </p><p>but ihat T noticed the time of the cancel- </p><p>ation. Then I was glad that I had not </p><p>shamed an innocent man. For, Mr. Ten- </p><p>ney, letters are not canceled until some </p><p>time after they are dropped into letter- </p><p>boxes—until they reach the post-office. </p><p>Even if the letter was brought directly to the </p><p>post-office, it reached there half an hour </p><p>before I—and the two others—left the </p><p>office. So it was impossible that my sten- </p><p>ographer—the First Assistant is bevond </p><p>suspicion —could have mailed the’ en- </p><p>velope. </p><p> “Mr. Tenney, remember that those plans</p><p>were exact copies of the ones in my safe. </p><p>Remember that no one left, entered, or </p><p>even knocked at the door between two and </p><p>six. The windows of my office communi- </p><p>cate with no other building; signaling was </p><p>out of the question. Nor was a dictagraph </p><p>employed to steal my dictation. </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “In my desperation I went to the de-</p><p>partment last night at shortly after mid- </p><p>night—I examined the walls—no wires! </p><p>Mr. Tenney, it is physically impossible </p><p>that those plans left my office before six. </p><p>Or afterwards—for they are still in my safe. </p><p> “And yet, some time between five and</p><p>five-thirty, a copy of plans—exact in every </p><p>detail—was mailed to a Japanese, who is </p><p>undoubtedly an agent of his native land. </p><p>Mr. Tenney, some one read my thoughts, </p><p>and—how long has it been continuing? </p><p>During the past weeks I’ve drawn up plans </p><p>for mobilization of troops on the Atlantic </p><p>Coast—on the Pacific. I’ve even drawn </p><p>up plans of our coast fortifications. </p><p> “And if this relatively unimportant</p><p>matter of mobilizing troops in the event of </p><p>trouble with Mexico is conveyed to Japan, </p><p>how am I to know that other matters— </p><p>Hawaii, San Francisco, the Philippines— </p><p>are not in her hands? I dare not think, I </p><p>dare not plan—I’m not a fool, Mr. Tenney. </p><p>And yet no one left my office, no one en- </p><p>tered-” </p><p> “What’s your stenographer’s name?”</p><p>demanded Tenney bruskly. </p><p> “James Colwell.”</p><p> “His salary?”</p><p> “Thirty dollars a week. But, Mr. Ten-</p><p>ney, why bother about him?” </p><p> “Did he make carbon copies of the</p><p>plans?” </p><p> “Yes—two. But I have those in the</p><p>safe, and-” </p><p> “Where did he come from?”</p><p> “He’s a civil service employee, Mr. Ten-</p><p>ney. I chose him because of his rapidity </p><p>and general usefulness. But why bother </p><p>about him? Haven’t I made it clear that </p><p>he could not have mailed the plans?” </p><p> “You’ve made it clear that some one</p><p>mailed them,” snapped Tenney. “And </p><p>you don’t really believe, in your heart of </p><p>hearts, that any one has been reading your </p><p>thoughts, do you?” </p><p> The Secretary smiled sheepishly.</p><p> “N-no, but—figures can’t lie, Mr. Ten-</p><p>ney. It was six when we left the office. </p><p>It was before half-past five when the plans </p><p>were mailed. And figures can’t lie, Mr. </p><p>Tenney; figures can’t lie!” </p><p> “True enough,” said Tenney, “but men</p><p>can, can’t they?” </p><p> The Secretary stared at him.</p><p> “What do you mean?”</p><p> “I’m not sure that I know myself what</p><p> I mean,” said Tenney. “But—you’ve told</p><p> me everything. And Dilkes is the only</p><p> man you’ve told besides me?”</p><p> The Secretary nodded.</p><p> “Good," said Tenney. “Now, then—</p><p> you keep quiet about this matter. There’s</p><p> nothing gained by announcing it.”</p><p> “Are you going to arrest the Jap—</p><p> Marcy?” asked Dilkes.</p><p> “What’s the use, now?” asked Tenney.</p><p> “He’d not give up anything. And it would</p><p> only warn whoever is selling the secrets.”</p><p> “But what are you going to do?” cried</p><p> the harassed Secretary.</p><p> Tenney grinned.</p><p> “Me? I’m going to put these plans in a</p><p> fresh envelope and address them to Itchi</p><p> Marcy.”</p><p> The Secretary gasped.</p><p> “Give him the plans that we've saved?”</p><p> “And if we don’t?” said Tenney smooth-</p><p> ly. “Isn’t their failure to arrive going to</p><p> alarm him—and the man who supplies him?</p><p> And whom do we want?”</p><p> “Wh-why—the man who sells the plans,”</p><p> stammered the Secretary.</p><p> “Right,” said Tenney.</p><p> He started for the door. The Secretary</p><p> half rose.</p><p> “You think you—can discover him?”</p><p> Tenney laughed.</p><p> “I know where he is right now.”</p><p> The Secretary stared.</p><p> “Then arrest him! Arrest him! Let’s</p><p> get a file of marines, and-"</p><p> But Tenney shook his head.</p><p> “I said I know where he is; that isn’t</p><p> saying I can prove anything. You’ll hear</p><p> from me within twenty-four hours.”</p><p> He nodded bruskly and was gone. The</p><p> Secretary stared at the Chief of the Secret</p><p> Service.</p><p> “Are you sure the man is capable?’ he</p><p> asked. “Remember how important the</p><p> matter is; and he treats it carelessly. He</p><p> says he knows; he—figures can’t lie, Dilkes;</p><p> figures can’t lie!”</p><p> “But Tenney said that men can.” replied</p><p> the Chief.</p><p> “And what did he mean?"</p><p> Dilkes stared at the Secretary.</p><p> “Lord, Mr. Secretary, 1 never know what</p><p> he means. But he said it, and I ve noticed</p><p> he never says anything without a reason.</p><p> But the desperate cabinet officcr could</p><p> only pass his hand across his brow as if</p><p> to wipe away the agony for which the</p><p>Figures Can’t Lie </p><p>187 </p><p> departure of Tenney and his confident</p><p> manner had made room.</p><p>BUT Tenney did not mail the </p><p>plans to Itchi Marcy. Tenney </p><p>was not above changing his mind. </p><p>In a corner of a quiet cafe to which he re- </p><p>paired after leaving the Chief’s office </p><p>Tenney thought. </p><p> Tenney was neither a faker nor a bluffer.</p><p>His confidence when he left the Secretary </p><p>had not been assumed. He had his own </p><p>reasons for confidence. </p><p> ( “It’s half the battle/’ he used to say. “If</p><p>I'm dead sure that I’m going to get </p><p>what I m after, I don’t have time to </p><p>think about the possibility of losing out, </p><p>and if I don t think about losing, well—I </p><p>don’t lose.” </p><p> But now, as he mused over a bottle of</p><p>lithia water, some of Tenney’s past success- </p><p>born confidence oozed away from him. </p><p>The hopeful scientist, on the seeming verge </p><p>of a great discovery, is brought Precog- </p><p>nition of failure by the contemplation of </p><p>the hgures of his last test—for he knows </p><p>the figures do not lie. Matter-of-fact, al- </p><p>most phlegmatic, was Tenney; that dis- </p><p>embodied spirits had copied the plans, </p><p>Tenney did not believe. And yet—figures </p><p>could not lie, as the Secretary had hope- </p><p>lessly declared. </p><p> Didn’t the Japanese boast of a culture,</p><p>an education, a religion, that went back to </p><p>those ages before Christianity dawned?</p><p>Didn’t intelligent men claim that the an- </p><p>cient civilizations of Asia were close to the </p><p>scheme of the Universe and the Powers that </p><p>planned the scheme? For one fraction of </p><p>a second Tenney felt his flesh crawl. </p><p> Then he drained his glass, rose to his feet</p><p>and took his heavy way out of the cafe. </p><p>I his was the twentieth century; for every </p><p>physical ellect, there was a physical reason. </p><p>Such was Tenney’s philosophy, and by it he </p><p>would abide. What he had told the Sec- </p><p>retary was true; he knew where the man was </p><p>who had sold the secrets; he must know, or </p><p>else black magic existed in these sane days. </p><p>But who the man was was different from </p><p>where he was. The where was easy; the </p><p>who—Tenney’s lips hardened as he struck </p><p>away from the cafe. </p><p> He examined the typewritten address</p><p>on the envelope addressed to the Japanese </p><p>jruiterer. Of course each typewriter had </p><p>Us own distinct identity. Bui to I race the </p><p> identity—it wasn’t even worth while to</p><p> examine the machines in the War Depart-</p><p> ment. Ihe man clever enough to effect</p><p> this treason was not fool enough to use a</p><p> machine that might be traced. He had</p><p> probably gone to any one of a hundred</p><p> places where he might use a machine for a</p><p> few minutes. It would mean weeks of</p><p> laborious search to trace the machine.</p><p> Tenney shook his head; he wouldn't do it.</p><p> Whoever the traitor was, he was nothing</p><p> short of a genius in his cunning. Genius</p><p> —that was it.</p><p> “Yet genius,” said Tennev to himself,</p><p> “is merely the art of taking' pains. This</p><p> fellow took infinite pains to prove that an</p><p> apparent impossibility had been effected.</p><p> \Y hy? So that in the event of discovery</p><p> he would never be suspected.”</p><p> He stopped short in his walk and</p><p> scratched his head. Suddenly he laushed</p><p> to himself.</p><p> “If I try thinking this out,” he told him-</p><p> self, "I’ll go as bug as the Secretary is get-</p><p> ting. Nix! I’ll do something!”</p><p> He strode toward the post-office. Care-</p><p> lessly, he had neglected to take the name of</p><p> the mail-sorter. He would not go back</p><p> and ask the Secretary for it, for the post-</p><p> office was close at hand; he could find the</p><p> name there. And so he did; liis gold badge</p><p> ga\ e him access to the list of employees and</p><p> their hours of duty. It was not Tenney's</p><p> method to ask directly for information</p><p> when indirection accomplished the same</p><p> thing. Direction crystallized suspicion; there</p><p> was no reason why the postal people</p><p> should know of his wish to see the sorter</p><p> So why let them know? Why £rive them</p><p> opportunity to talk?</p><p> Tenney took the list and ran over it: he</p><p> found the name of Michael Clarke, sorter</p><p> hours from 4 r. m. to midnight. He</p><p> must be the man who had notified the</p><p> Secretary of the treason. Tennev started</p><p> to fold up the list, his eye run^iing idlv</p><p> down the columns of names as he did so.</p><p> As though printed in letters of llame. he</p><p>saw the name Henry Davis. The camera </p><p>eye begets the photographic brain. He </p><p>knew the name, and the face that the name </p><p>belonged to stood before his mental eves. </p><p> et lenuey did not start, gave no sign of</p><p>emotion. He merely folded the paper </p><p>neatly and handed it to the chief clerk who </p><p>thanksr°CUred ^ f°r ^ With a </p><p>l88 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Hope there’s no scandal in our depart-</p><p> ment,” said the clerk anxiously.</p><p> “If there were I’d be liable to tell you,</p><p> wouldn’t I?” grinned Tenney.</p><p> And then he left the building, his entire</p><p> plan of action changed. He had intended</p><p> to visit the sorter, in order to go over care-</p><p> fully the latter’s tale of the discovery. He</p><p> had intended to mail the plans to Marcy</p><p> that suspicion might not be aroused. Bet-</p><p> ter to let the Japs get one more secret than</p><p> so to alarm the plotters that they might</p><p> further conceal their identities and methods.</p><p>But now- </p><p> “It’s a hunch,” said Tenney, “it’s a</p><p>hunch! But so’s most of this game.” </p><p> For Tenney was frank, even with him-</p><p>self. He knew that common sense, appli- </p><p>cation and luck were the chief elements of </p><p>the criminologist’s success. The first two </p><p>he had always; the third he seized upon </p><p>whensoever he might. </p><p> THE landlady of the modest board-</p><p> ing house was most loquacious.</p><p> “Far be it from a widow woman</p><p>with her living to make to gossip about her </p><p>guests, Mr. Davis,” she said, “but, honest, </p><p>I’m glad you’re here. Your brother is </p><p>always reg’lar with his rent money, Mr. </p><p>Davis, and I dunno’s I have any call to say </p><p>anything at all about him; but me taking a </p><p>sort of interest in all my guests, and you </p><p>being his own brother seems like my con- </p><p>science compels me to tell you that your </p><p>brother is carrying on awful, Mr. Davis.” </p><p> "Boys will be boys, Mrs. Paxton,” grin-</p><p> ned the pseudo Davis.</p><p> “I know that, Mr. Davis, and your</p><p>brother is a nicc-mannered boy, too. But </p><p>he ain't been to home at all last night. And </p><p>last week he was out three whole nights and </p><p>the week before that four times, and—I </p><p>don’t want you should repeat all this. But </p><p>when your brother came here a year ago he </p><p>was as nice a young man as I’d want to </p><p>meet. </p><p> “But lately—he’s got in bad company,</p><p>Mr. Davis. 1 knew it; for in his room I’ve </p><p>found racin’ papers, and pieces of cardboard </p><p>that I know are bettin’ tickets. My poor </p><p>dead husband had that bad habit—playin’ </p><p>the races, Mr. Davis, and I know the bettin’ </p><p>tickets when I see ’em. It led my husband </p><p>to drink and then—I’m a widow woman, </p><p>now, Mr. Davis, and I feel it’s my Christian </p><p>duty to tell you about your young brother </p><p>so’s you can snatch him from the burnin’, </p><p>Mr. Davis. And if you’re offended and </p><p>get him to move—well, I've done ray duty, </p><p>Mr. Davis.” </p><p> “I’m not offended,” was her visitor’s</p><p>answer. “I appreciate your kindness. I </p><p>shall certainly lecture my brother.” </p><p> “You certainly ought to, sir,” said the</p><p>landlady. “Him bettin’ two hundred at </p><p>a clip—I dunno how he does it on his salary. </p><p>He’s headed for ruin, sir, if you'll excuse a </p><p>Christian woman for sayin’ what it’s her </p><p>bounden duty to say.” </p><p> “Thank you, Mrs. Paxton,” was the</p><p>grave answer. “I’ll see Henry today. </p><p>Good afternoon. I’m only sorry- that he </p><p>wasn’t at home. But you tell him of my </p><p>call if he comes home before I get back. </p><p>Have him stay in.” </p><p> “I will, sir,” promised the landlady.</p><p> Whereupon Tenney, making mental note</p><p>to send the landlady a twenty-dollar bill </p><p>for the information which she had given to </p><p>the alleged brother of the young mail clerk, </p><p>Henry Davis, departed from the house of </p><p>the valuable and good-hearted Mrs. Paxton. </p><p>Around the corner he found a drug store </p><p>wherein was a Washington directory. He </p><p>turned to the C’s. Shortly he was in pos- </p><p>session of the information that James Col- </p><p>well, clerk in the War Department, lived </p><p>at an address near Dupont Circle. Ten- </p><p>ney’s eyebrows were raised. He smiled and </p><p>bent his steps in the direction oi the sten- g- </p><p>rapher’s address. It was a private hotel, </p><p>one of the best. Colwell's entire weekly </p><p>salary would hardly pay the stenographer’s </p><p>rent, much less clothe and feed him.</p><p> “It’s a wonder,' said Tenney to himself,</p><p>“that the main guys don't look after their </p><p>employees more. Trust a man with im- </p><p>portant, priceless secrets, and never in- </p><p>vestigate to see what’s his manner of liv- </p><p>ing!” </p><p> He grunted disgust at the fatuousness</p><p>that trusted without investigation, and left </p><p>the neighborhood. Half an hour lat» r he </p><p>entered the fruit store of Itchi Marcy. </p><p>There happened to be no customers in the </p><p>store at the moment, and a white clerk ^as </p><p>engaged in piling fruit in attractive </p><p>mids. Tenney walked past him and ad- </p><p>dressed himself to a bright-eyed Japanese </p><p>who sat at a desk. From an inner pocket </p><p>the Secret Service man pulled the bundle ot </p><p>plans, in a plain envelope. He laid them </p><p>on Marcy’s desk. </p><p>Figures Can’t Lie </p><p>189 </p><p> “I suppose you were alarmed because</p><p>they hadn’t come, eh?” </p><p> The Jap looked up suspiciously; he</p><p>opened the envelope and glanced at the </p><p>contents. </p><p> “Why were they sent this way?” he asked.</p><p> “Getting a little leery of the mail,” was</p><p> Tenney’s answer. “It looked safer this</p><p> way.”</p><p> “Who are you?” demanded Marcy.</p><p> “Oh, I’m just a friend,” smiled Tenney.</p><p> “I'm getting mine, which reminds me,</p><p> he—you know who I mean—says he needs</p><p> a bunch of coin today. Anything doing?”</p><p> The Jap looked again at the envelope’s</p><p> contents. If he had any suspicion it vanished</p><p> at a closer examination of the papers. He</p><p> unlocked his safe, placing the papers there-</p><p> in and at the same time extracting from a</p><p> drawer some bills of a denomination quite</p><p> large to be in the possession of a retail</p><p> fruiterer. He handed the money to Tenney.</p><p> The latter shook his head. He achieved a</p><p> sullenly sheepish look.</p><p> “Put it in an envelope,” he said, “and</p><p> seal it. He—he don’t trust me a whole</p><p>lot,-him, and he’ll swear I copped some </p><p> for myself if it ain’t in an envelope.”</p><p> Again the Jap looked curiously at Tenney.</p><p> But he made no demur. He placed the</p><p> bills in an envelope, sealed it, and handed</p><p> it to Tenney. The latter shook his head.</p><p> “Address it,” he demanded.</p><p> The Jap’s eyes gleamed; his hand shot</p><p>forth and pulled open Tenney’s coat; the </p><p>useful little gold badge with the insignia </p><p>of the Secret Service was revealed. Marcy’s</p><p>other hand shot to a drawer in his desk, but </p><p>Tenney had recovered from Ins first sur- </p><p>prise; his fingers closed around the wrist of </p><p>Marcy. There was a wrench, a straining </p><p>heave, and the Jap was hurled from his </p><p>chair and lay twitching upon the floor. </p><p>Before the white clerk had gathered his </p><p>startled wits, Tenney was at the door, </p><p>whistling peculiarly. A blue uniform came </p><p>around the corner and its wearer saw the </p><p>upraised finger of Tenney and came down </p><p>the street on the run. The operative </p><p>turned to the alarmed clerk. </p><p> “Nothin’s goin’ to happen lo you, son;</p><p> this isn’t a hold-up. Your boss is going on</p><p> a little visit with this gentleman.” And</p><p> he indicated the policeman. To the latter</p><p> he showed his badge. “Lock that Jap up,”</p><p> he said. “Tell the Captain that no one is</p><p> to see him, not if it’s the Jap Ambassador.</p><p>Tell him it’s the Secret Service. Got me?" </p><p>The policeman, dazed but understanding, </p><p>nodded. He bent over the form of Marcy. </p><p> “A little water, that’s all,” said Tenney.</p><p>“He was going to use a gun on me, but I </p><p>beat him at his own game; I knew a little </p><p>jiu-jitsu. Ring up the patrol, lock up this </p><p>store, and put him in a cell. I'll be around </p><p>tonight to make a charge. And mind you. </p><p>No lawyers—nobody—to see him. </p><p> Again the officer nodded assent. Tenney</p><p>walked to the safe and calmly abstracted </p><p>the plans which had just been sold to the </p><p>Japanese. Then he left the fruit store, a </p><p>smile of chagrin wreathing his lips. </p><p> “I fell down there,” he said ““but that</p><p>doesn't prove that I’m not right. Marcy </p><p>was too clever, but—I don't believe the </p><p>other fellow is.” </p><p> He hailed a passing taxi and directed</p><p>that he be driven to the Bennings race- </p><p>track. Half an hour later, in the betting- </p><p>ring, he found the man for whom he was </p><p>looking, Mr. Peter Firkins, the wine-bibber </p><p>of the morning. Firkins was under the </p><p>influence of liquor, but not completely so, </p><p>by any manner of means. As the negro </p><p>waiter had said. Firkins must have been </p><p>hollow; or else much practise enabled him </p><p>to earn* much liquor. The man was just </p><p>drunk enough to be ugly. </p><p> He was standing before a betting-stool,</p><p>angrily tearing up tickets on the last race </p><p>when Tenney sighted him. There was on </p><p>his face the scowl of the bad loser. By his </p><p>side was one of the touts of the morning, </p><p>apparently pleading with Firkins to follow </p><p>his judgment in the next race. But Firkins</p><p>had evdiently been losing on the first thr^e </p><p>races—it was mid-aftemoon now, and half </p><p>the day’s card had been run off. </p><p> For he waved the tout away from him.</p><p>refusing to be cajoled. The tout slunk </p><p>sulkily away and Tenney approached the </p><p>buyer of champagnc. He touched him on </p><p>the shoulder and Firkins turned. </p><p> “Well, what do you want?” he demanded</p><p>angrily. </p><p> “The apple-cart’s upset,” said Tenney</p><p>with an air of caution. “I was told to tip </p><p>you off.” </p><p> The drunken man stared; slowly the</p><p>cryptic meaning of Tenney's words pene- </p><p>trated his intelligence. </p><p> “You mean that Marcy-”</p><p> The strong fingers of Tenney gripped the</p><p>man’s wrist. </p><p>190 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Well, Mr. Henry Davis, otherwise</p><p>l’eter Firkins, I guess that’s enough. Come </p><p>along with me!" </p><p>f£5Q| AT EIGHT o’clock that same </p><p>night Tenney entered the private </p><p>office of the Secretary of War. </p><p>Already in the room were the Secretary, </p><p>Dilkes, Stenographer Colwell, and First- </p><p>Assistant Secretary Jamieson. The eager </p><p>Secretary did not bother to make intro- </p><p>ductions; he did not wait until Tenney was </p><p>fairly within the room. </p><p> "Have you got him? Have you got</p><p>him? You ’phoned that-” </p><p> “I know where he is,” said Tenney.</p><p>“But before I tell his name, before an arrest </p><p>is made, maybe you’d like to be as certain </p><p>as I am.” </p><p> “Of course, of course,” cried the Secre-</p><p>tary. “Tell us—tell us how you-” </p><p> Tenney sank into a chair. As he did so</p><p>he squirmed and reached behind him; he </p><p>pulled forth a revolver and laid it on his </p><p>knees. </p><p> “Excuse me,” he said, “but sitting on</p><p>knobby steel ain’t pleasant.” He looked </p><p>about him at his auditors, a hard light in </p><p>his eyes. </p><p> “Never go anywhere without this little</p><p>gun,” he said. “I can sure use it, too.” </p><p> Then he leaned comfortably back in his</p><p>chair, playing, with apparent idleness, with </p><p>his weapon. Dilkes, unseen by the others, </p><p>loosened his own revolver in the patent </p><p>holster in his waistcoat. Dilkes, of them </p><p>all, was the only one who knew that Tenney </p><p>never played with deadly weapons. Dilkes</p><p>wanted to be ready. </p><p> “This morning,” said Tenney, “I saw a</p><p>man buying wine. Nothing strange about </p><p>that durin’ the racin’ season, only—I knew </p><p>the man’s face and didn’t know his name. </p><p>And when I saw his name on a hotel register </p><p>the name didn’t fit the face. Something </p><p>queer about that, gentlemen. </p><p> “I’m not infallible—not by a long shot,</p><p>but give me face and give me name and I’ll </p><p>remember the time and place where I met </p><p>the man if it was thirty years ago. But </p><p>I’d never met a man named Peter Firkins, </p><p>which* was the name of my wine-buying </p><p>friend. Funny thing, for I knew his </p><p> f ilCC#</p><p> “I forgot the little puzzle a while later,</p><p>though, for you, Mr. Secretary, gave me </p><p>something else to think about. But the </p><p>puzzle came back to me a while later, f.,r </p><p>I happened to be in the post-office and </p><p>there I saw a name that fitted the face of </p><p>the wine party. And name and face </p><p>brought back time and event; I'd seen my </p><p>wine-buying friend two years ago, in the </p><p>post-office, during an investigation. I'd </p><p>learned liis name. then. </p><p> “Well, gentlemen, I was on another case,</p><p>and the fact that a postal clerk was using </p><p>another name didn't interest me just then. </p><p>At least, it wouldn’t have interested me if </p><p>it hadn’t happened that this clerk's hours </p><p>were from two until ten, and if it hadn't </p><p>also happened that between those hours he </p><p>canceled all the mail that came from a </p><p>certain city district. </p><p> “Yes, gentlemen, this clerk Davis, that</p><p>I’d seen masquerading as Firkins, took in </p><p>all the letters that certain carriers brought </p><p>to the post-office between two and ten. </p><p>And among those certain carriers were the </p><p>carriers who collected mail from the War </p><p>Department or the near vicinity. Yes, </p><p>his hours and duties were all printed on the </p><p>paper the post-office people showed me. </p><p> “And gentlemen,-that made me mighty</p><p>interested in Davis-Firkins. For some one </p><p>was stealing War-Departnient secrets and </p><p>selling them to the Japs. And, gentlemen, </p><p>it was impossible for any one but the Secre- </p><p>tary, his Assistant, or his stenographer, to </p><p>steal these secrets.” </p><p> His fingers closed about his gun and his</p><p>stem eyes swept the room. </p><p> “Don’t any one move, please, until I’ve</p><p>finished,” he'snapped. Then he resumed. </p><p>“It also seemed impossible for any of these </p><p>three to be the guilty party. But. gentle-</p><p>men, it was impossible for an outsider to </p><p>steal the secrets; it only seemed impossible </p><p>for the Secretary, his Assistant, or his </p><p>stenographer, to steal them. </p><p> “The stolen plans were mailed, gentle-</p><p>men! They were mailed—so that no person </p><p>could be traced—to an agent of Japan, it </p><p>seemed impossible that any of the three </p><p>persons I’ve named could have mailed those </p><p>plans, because the envelope containing </p><p>them was postmarked at 5:30 P. M., and </p><p>none left the office until six. And tgures </p><p>can’t lie. But I saw the way in which </p><p>the man who made the figures could lie. </p><p> “I saw the way, and I had seen the man</p><p>who had it in his power to save the traitor </p><p>from suspicion in the event of discovery o </p><p>the theft of the plans; I had seen tna </p><p>Figures Can’t Lie </p><p>191 </p><p> postal clerk buying champagne in the com-</p><p> pany of racing men—men who were with</p><p> him to bleed him.</p><p> “Gentlemen, I looked up the postal clerk.</p><p> I found that he was poor not so very long</p><p> ago; that he had no money outside his</p><p> salary; that no inheritance had been left</p><p> him. I then looked up one of the three</p><p> men who knew of the plans, because he had</p><p> helped draw them up. Then I arrested</p><p> the agent of Japan. Then I arrested Davis-</p><p> Firkins, and he gave himself away. Some</p><p> one," he drawled, “might as well do a little</p><p> confessing; it’s good for the soul.”</p><p> For a moment there was a dead silence.</p><p> Then the Secretary spoke.</p><p> “Did the Jap speak? Did the postal</p><p>clerk confess?” </p><p> Tenney shook his head.</p><p> Neither of them; haven’t bothered to</p><p>question them. I know without them. </p><p>The plans w’ere mailed to Marcy last night </p><p>—after six! The man who mailed them </p><p>dreaded discovery; he feared to deliver the </p><p>plans m person, or through an agent lest he </p><p>be traced. So he mailed them.' But even </p><p>then there might be discovery, as indeed </p><p>there was. And he was cautious—oh </p><p>cautious as the devil makes his own who </p><p>betray their native land! So he bribed a </p><p>postal clerk; bribed him to stamp letters </p><p>with a cancelation mark timed'earlier than </p><p>the letters W’ere mailed. It was clever—- </p><p>too clever! </p><p> If the traitor had made it seem possible</p><p> that an outsider had stolen the plans he</p><p> might not have been suspected. But the</p><p> traitor had to come to this building to get</p><p> the plans; he wranted his after-hours visit</p><p> to seem innocent. And so it would have</p><p> seemed, with the envelope canceled-hours</p><p> before that night visit, if it had not been</p><p> that the tool he used was w^eak; if it had</p><p> not been that Davis could not stand pros-</p><p> perity and that I—that I’m lucky.</p><p> As it is Colwell, you might as well</p><p>own up. Why, I even know’ that vou own </p><p>a portable typewriter which you brought </p><p>m here, lest the print of the office machine </p><p>be recognized.” </p><p> The stenographer leaped to his feet.</p><p> ‘I? Own up? For God’s sake, Mr.</p><p>detective, you don’t accusc me of—of be- </p><p>traying my country?” </p><p>“You live m one of the most expensive </p><p>Private h?te,s in the city,” snapped Ten- </p><p>«-&gt;, and your salary is thirty dollars a </p><p> week. Care to own up? It may make</p><p> things easier for you!”</p><p> Colwell turned to the Secretary.</p><p> “Mr. Secretary, you won’t listen to this</p><p> man s jumble of falsehoods! I—why, I</p><p> don’t know w'hat he’s talking about.' As</p><p> for my money—my living at the Allerton,</p><p> why—you yourself know that my family</p><p> is wealthy; that I only entered the Depart-</p><p> ment because I chose it for my career.</p><p> You—don’t believe him—don’t—with his</p><p> absurd deductions, his drunken men, hi«</p><p> postal clerks, his-</p><p>Tenney rose and walked to the door. </p><p>“You don’t have to believe me, Mr. </p><p>Secretary; the night-watchman who let him </p><p>into the building at eight o’clock last ni^ht </p><p>is outside.” </p><p> He flung the door open.</p><p> Cavanaugh,” he said to the man stand-</p><p> ing outside, “come in.

Tauiie-</p><p> son?”</p><p> There w^as torturing silence for a moment.</p><p> Then Tenney gently pushed the watchman</p><p> out and closed the door. He stared down</p><p> at the First-Assistant Secretary of Wax</p><p> the “man above suspicion,”‘who had</p><p> sunk into a chair, his face hidden in his</p><p> hands.</p><p> “Jamieson, Jamieson!” gasped the Secre-</p><p>tary. “Not you, not you!

Not' you— </p><p>not you—Jamieson! Not you!” </p><p> There came no answer from the stricken</p><p>traitor. The Secretary’s horrified grief </p><p>turned to anger. He strode to the limp </p><p>hgure in the chair and shook him. No </p><p>answer; he bent over him. pulling the shield- </p><p>ing hands from the face. A moment he </p><p>stared; then he arose, shocked sadness in </p><p>his eyes. He straightened the hands of </p><p>the man whom discovery had slain. </p><p>192 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “It’s better this way, far better,” he said.</p><p>“The name of Jamieson stands high in the </p><p>nation’s scroll of heroes.

But, old man, </p><p>when you told us you knew the traitor, </p><p>weren’t you—er—patting yourself a bit on </p><p>the back? Weren’t you—er—bragging </p><p>when you said, before you began work on </p><p>the case, that you knew the identity of the </p><p>traitor?” </p><p> Tenney grinned.</p><p> “You ain’t got the memory I have,</p><p>Chief, or else you'd know that I didn’t sav </p><p>that I knew who the traitor was; I said I </p><p>knew where he was! I knew he was in the </p><p>War Department all the time.

It </p><p>to and fro along the walls of the </p><p>finally rolling out upon the flat at </p><p>the mouth of the canon in a very volume of </p><p>sound. </p><p> John Wilkes, ex - deputy sheriff, cow-</p><p>puncher, prospector on occasion, came to </p><p>the door of his store and stared up the val- </p><p>ley from under the sharp of his hand. </p><p> “Now I wonder what in the world them</p><p>fools wants to go about the land shootin’ </p><p>their guns off fer an’ skeerin’ out of the </p><p>county what little game there’s been left in </p><p>it. Dailey ought to know better even if </p><p>Boaz don’t. They ain't either of ’em got </p><p>brains enough to freight a louse with.” </p><p> He stood for a moment staring up the</p><p>canon, his gray beard moving slowly up </p><p>and down like a goat’s, as he thoughtfully </p><p>masticated his tobacco, and then, passing </p><p>inside the building, he devoted himself to a </p><p>methodical re-arrangement on the shelves </p><p>of what little stock his store boasted. </p><p> It was not an alluring place, Preciosa.</p><p>Why it should have been so named none </p><p>but Heaven knew. There was indeed no </p><p>special reason why it should ever have been </p><p>settled at all. Mr. Wilkes, who had wan- </p><p>dered foot-loose over Arizona for more than </p><p>thirty-five years, had his own theories on </p><p>the reasons for the original settlement of </p><p>Arizona. </p><p> “It ain’t no example of a country where</p><p>a virtuous an* hard-workin’ peasantry set- </p><p>tled to git ‘Freedom to worship God,' like </p><p>I read of in a book once. -An” they didn't </p><p>come out here beca’se they coveted a acre </p><p>of God’s footstool to raise their children </p><p>an’ perpetuate their virtues that makes the </p><p>The Salters </p><p>193 </p><p>safeguard of a state. I heard a feller say </p><p>that once at a Fourth o'July meetin’— No, </p><p>sir, it ain’t none o’ them! That ain’t the </p><p>way Arizona come to be settled. She got </p><p>settled. The reason you find so many hell- </p><p>holes with people in ’em down here in the </p><p>Southwest is because people was movin’ </p><p>through here to git to a better place an’ </p><p>their cattle died. They couldn’t git away </p><p>and they had to stay.” </p><p> In which remark there was much truth.</p><p> He was disturbed at his quasi-quiet task</p><p>of re-arranging his stock by the entrance of </p><p>two men who stamped their way into the </p><p>cool interior of the adobe building, demand- </p><p>ing beer. Mr. Wilkes produced three bot- </p><p>tles—warm, opened them by the simple pro-</p><p>cess of knocking off the necks against his </p><p>spurred heel and set them on the counter. </p><p>Silence reigned while the three men gulped </p><p>down the warm beer. </p><p> “This is shore a pleasant place,” ejacu-</p><p>lated Dailey staring out into the hot sun- </p><p>shine where the heat-horizon of the desert </p><p>fairly winked at him. </p><p> “Well—” Mr. Wilkes spat judicially at a</p><p>tarantula that was striving vainly to carry </p><p>off the body of a dead desert rat—“I like </p><p>it.” </p><p> “You—like—it?” Boaz stared at him.</p><p> “Yep. I like it. Oh, I don’t .mean I’m</p><p>plumb foolish about it, but I do like it after </p><p>a fashion. That is, I like it about as much </p><p>as a man would like bein’ scalped.” </p><p> Boaz snorted like a horse.</p><p> “You’re a-fool, John,” he said ami-</p><p>ably. </p><p> “Sure I am,” agreed Mr. Wilkes. “What</p><p>else would I be here fer? Tell me that?” </p><p> Boaz did not answer, but stood looking</p><p>out across the plain that wrapped Preciosa </p><p>as in a blanket. </p><p>PRECIOSA stands out upon the </p><p>brown desert exactly as a cake of </p><p>chocolate stands out upon a mahog- </p><p>any table. There is nothing there, if one </p><p>excepts the public corral built of long-dis- </p><p>carded railroad cross-ties stood on end and </p><p>interlaced with branches of long-dead mes- </p><p>quit, the one well from which alkali water </p><p>is pumped by a lame white horse that, </p><p>blindfolded, tramps his wean,' round pump- </p><p>ing up the water which Mr. Wilkes sells for </p><p>ten cents a bucketful, John Wilkes’s store </p><p>and hotel, and three other houses near the </p><p>little railroad station. </p><p>13. </p><p> The one thing that gives the place any</p><p>importance in the scheme of things is the </p><p>fact that Preciosa is the railroad station for </p><p>Fort Stevens, distant twenty miles due </p><p>north, and Fort Stevens, during these days </p><p>when the Mexican Border was being as </p><p>closely guarded as the convents were guard- </p><p>ed during the Thirty Years’ War, was an </p><p>important point, being the station of the </p><p>16th Regiment of Cavalry, to which force, </p><p>for its sins, was assigned the pleasant duty </p><p>of policing and patroling the adjacent sec- </p><p>tion of the Mexican-American International </p><p>Line. </p><p> The population of Preciosa has never ex-</p><p>ceeded thirty people. The three white men </p><p>who were as regular in their attendance at </p><p>Mr. Wilkes’ saloon as the minute-hand upon</p><p>a watch, were Wilkes himself, Peter Dailey </p><p>and Tom Boaz. The last-named men were </p><p>partners in a great if unremunerative cattle </p><p>ranch a few miles to the west of Preciosa. </p><p>On this particular occasion they had met as </p><p>usual to discuss grievances. </p><p> “I been talkin’ to Boaz this mornin’,</p><p>John,” said Mr. Dailey. “Do you know </p><p>that old Colonel Borden that’s been in com- </p><p>mand at Fort Stevens fer the past two </p><p>years?” </p><p> “As well as I know my own dog,” said</p><p>Mr. Wilkes. “Only I ain’t got no dog.” </p><p>“He’s sure gettin' some afflictin’ with his </p><p>‘My man, this’ an’ ‘My man, that’ whenever </p><p>he sees me. My name’s Dailey, an’ he knows </p><p>it, an’ some day I’m goin' to fLx him so’s </p><p>he’ll remember it-” </p><p> He lapsed into silence, eyed by the ob-</p><p>servant Mr. Wilkes, who was morally cer- </p><p>tain there was something in the wind. </p><p> “Say, John,” he said presently, “are you</p><p>aimin’ to sell that claim of voum up the </p><p>canon? The one by Willow Water, I </p><p>mean?” </p><p> “I been aimin' to sell it fer some time,”</p><p>replied the cautious Mr. Wilkes, “but I </p><p>took a rotten bad aim. The man got </p><p>away.” </p><p> “Who was he, John?”</p><p> “I don’t know rightly. He told me he</p><p>was the Dead Agent fer the district.” </p><p> "The—the what?”</p><p> “The Dead Agent.” -</p><p> “What in-’s a Dead Agent, John?”</p><p> “That's what I asked him. He told me</p><p>that the Dead Agent was the man who has </p><p>the contract to supply able-bodied voters </p><p>fer every Democrat who’s died in the </p><p>194 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>District since the last election. That’s </p><p>why he left before I got the chance to un- </p><p>load that claim on him.” </p><p> “What do you want fer it?”</p><p> “It ain’t fer sale,” declared the astute</p><p>Mr. Wilkes. “Not now. Not till 1 know </p><p>somethin’ more about it.” </p><p> “Why not? You ain’t got nothin’ up</p><p>there-” </p><p> “Oh, yes, 1 have, too. I got an eighty-</p><p>foot tunnel all timbered up-” </p><p> “You never got no color there, did you?”</p><p>MR. WILKES started to shake his </p><p>head, then stopped so suddenly that </p><p>his hat fell oil. He replaced it, </p><p>thinking rapidly. He remembered the gun- </p><p>shot up the valley and he knew that both</p><p>Boaz and Dailey were too lazy to wander </p><p>so far from home afoot after the small game </p><p>of the canon. They might have been blast- </p><p>ing on his old claim. He had spent bis last </p><p>dollar on it the year before and had never </p><p>got enough gold out of the entire eighty </p><p>feet of tunnel “to fill a tooth with,” as he </p><p>expressed it. </p><p> Disheartenment, however, was far from</p><p>him. He well knew the truth of the miner’s </p><p>maxim that “Gold is where you find it.” </p><p>Perhaps Boaz and Dailey had something </p><p>up their sleeves and would let him in on it. </p><p>Certainly he would gain nothing by hurry- </p><p>ing them. He would let them take their </p><p>time. </p><p> “What do you fellers mean?” he asked</p><p>slowly. “What’s the game?” </p><p> “Oh, nothin’. We just thought we’d offer</p><p>you some spot cash fer that old claim.” </p><p>“What do you want it fer?” </p><p> “It’s a good hole, an’ it’s a deep hole,”</p><p>said Dailey reflectively; “an* me an’ Boaz </p><p>thought maybe we might make a grub- </p><p>stake by cuttin’ it up into post-holes an’ </p><p>shippin’ it north where the squatters is ta- </p><p>kin’ up land-” </p><p> He successfully dodged the empty bottle</p><p>that Mr. Wilkes threw at him and returned </p><p>to the charge. </p><p> “On the level, John, me an’ Boaz Is get-</p><p>tin’ darned tired of bein’ always called ‘My </p><p>man’ by that ol’—oF—’’ he hesitated for </p><p>a name—“ol’ Lord Cornwallis—he's dead </p><p>an’ can’t kick—up at Fort Stevens. We’re </p><p>aimin’ to get a few dollars out o’ this an’ </p><p>get the ol’ Colonel to move back to Eng- </p><p>land again. Are you on?” </p><p> Mr. Wilkes yelped joyfully. He too had</p><p>had more than Lis share of the Colonel's </p><p>superiority. </p><p>“What’ll you take to let us work it, </p><p>John?” </p><p> “One-third share in whatever’s goin’, you</p><p>to pay all expenses,” said Mr. Wilkes cau- </p><p>tiously. He had been stung before by his </p><p>two friends and would take no chances. </p><p>“Done. Put it down on paper.” </p><p> Mr. Wilkes, drawing forth a scrap of</p><p>wrapping-paper and the stump of a pencil, </p><p>carefully set to work on the contract, inter- </p><p>larding his scholastic efforts with audible </p><p>sucks at his pencil. </p><p> “We had hard luck last month, John. We</p><p>lost a bunch of pretty good Hereford cattle. </p><p>W'e was aimin’ to ship ’em Fast, but some </p><p>greaser across the Line wished for 'em be- </p><p>fore we got a chance to ship. We had ’em</p><p>in the big pasture an’ they got across the </p><p>Line an’ cut the fence. One of our greaser </p><p>herders went at the same time. We had to </p><p>lick him once before fer earn in’ a runnin’ </p><p>iron under his saddle an’ brandin' maverick </p><p>calves- </p><p> “I never could see what you two was doiV</p><p>in puttin’ a wire fence around a pasture so </p><p>close to the Line.

"There'll be beef contracts </p><p>an’ oat an’ hay contracts, an’ if any more </p><p>troops should be sent here to help us poor </p><p>citizens tryin' to wrest a livin’ from a fruit- </p><p>less soil-’’ </p><p>“I get you,” said Mr. Wilkes joyfully. </p><p>“An’ we sent our affidavits to our Rep- </p><p>resentative in C ongress assembled, an’, John, </p><p>if you’d only hear Colonel Borden, up at </p><p>the Post, about his havin’ to split up his </p><p>The Salters </p><p>195 </p><p>regiment to guard the border, you’d think </p><p>hell had sure broke loose at last.” </p><p> “Where does he come in at?”</p><p> “He got orders to send detachments out</p><p>all along the Line to watch the waler-holes </p><p>to pertect the lives an’ property of-” </p><p> “You an’ Boaz? There ain’t no work in</p><p>guardin’ your property. You’re settin’ </p><p>down in ’em all the time-” </p><p> “So, seein’ that Colonel Borden’s got a</p><p>pile o’ cash an’ a most unlovely disposition, </p><p>me an’ Boaz has decided that he ain’t a de- </p><p>sirable citizen. We’re goin’ to move him </p><p>East, John. He thinks he’s a fine pros- </p><p>pector an’ knows all about minerals. I’ll </p><p>bet he never saw nothin’ like this. Look!” </p><p>He tossed a bit of shining quartz upon </p><p>the counter, under the nose of the aston-</p><p>ished Mr. Wilkes. </p><p> Mr. Wilkes examined it carefully-;</p><p> “That neS^er come from my claim,” he</p><p>said presently, having subjected the sam- </p><p>ple to every improvised test that he could </p><p>think of at the moment. </p><p> “It sure did, John; it come from that</p><p>very claim,” said Boaz, signing his name to </p><p>the paper that Mr. Wilkes had completed. </p><p>“Out of the shaft?” </p><p> “Often the ore-dump.”</p><p> “You’re a liar,” said Mr. Wilkes pleas-</p><p>antly. “There never was enough gold on </p><p>that whole dump to fill a tooth with.” </p><p> A sudden thought occurred to him and</p><p>he sat down upon an up-ended box, laugh- </p><p>,ing till the tears ran down his face. </p><p> “Go on,” he gasped. “Go on. You</p><p>two’ll be the death of me yit. Only mind </p><p>you, I don’t know nothin’ about the mat- </p><p>ter. I’m just a-rentin’ my claim to you two </p><p>to work, an’ I’m in on one-third of it, joke </p><p>or not. No matter how you git it.” </p><p> “I’m plain astonished at you, John,” said</p><p>Mr. Dailey in a tone of pained surprise. </p><p>“We’re goin’ to work that claim. Of course </p><p>we’ve got to get capital to start it with, </p><p>but we ain’t lookin’ to have no trouble in </p><p>gettin’ all the capital we want-” </p><p> “You won’t have—none at all, if you go</p><p>after it like that,” gasped Mr. Wilkes. </p><p>“You’ll git it, an’ in the meantime I’ll keep </p><p>this paptr.” </p><p> He folded up the painfully written docu-</p><p>ment and thrust it into his pocket and </p><p>stood watching the two men who had slow- </p><p>ly mounted and were plodding westward </p><p>into the red-hot dust of the Arizona after- </p><p>noon. </p><p>n </p><p> “I TELL you frankly, May, I am</p><p>getting very tired of stumbling over </p><p>that young cub, Mr. Needham, </p><p>every time I enter the house. He is quite as </p><p>bad as your Aunt Mollie’s dogs. I have to </p><p>stand the dogs, but I simply will not have </p><p>that youngster. It seems to me that you </p><p>should have more regard for what you know </p><p>my wishes are, than to have him here where </p><p>you know well he is not welcome-” </p><p> Miss Allardvce, toying with her grape-</p><p>fruit, made a little grimace at her uncle be- </p><p>fore she replied sweetly: </p><p> “I really do not see why it bothers you,</p><p>Uncle. He does not come to see you, and </p><p>as he never comes when you are in the </p><p>house, I really do not see quite how it can </p><p>actually annoy you. Since you assure me it</p><p>does, I will tell him that you do not wish to </p><p>see him. What time shall I tell him that </p><p>you will be out?” </p><p> “Out? Out? Who the deuce said I</p><p>would be out? I suppose I have a perfect </p><p>right to say who shall and who shall not </p><p>come to my house?" </p><p> “You can not well shut the door of your</p><p>house upon an officer of your own regiment </p><p>without giving some reason and that a good </p><p>one. Mr. Needham comes here for two </p><p>reasons. The first is because I asked him </p><p>to do so; the second is-” </p><p> She paused provokingly, rose and strolled</p><p>to the long glass that hung between the </p><p>windows. </p><p> “Well, are you or are you not going to</p><p>finish, what you started to say? You have </p><p>many bad habits, but none so bad as that. </p><p>Am I to be kept waiting all day to hear </p><p>your second reason? What the devil is </p><p>your second reason, miss?” </p><p> “I have an idea—now mind you, Uncle</p><p>Jim, it is really no more than an idea. I </p><p>may not be right—I would not say it, </p><p>though, unless I had some really good </p><p>reason for believing my informant to be </p><p>correct. Any wav, I did it. all for the </p><p>best. You know that, don't you, uncle?” </p><p>“Good Heavens! Say it! What do you </p><p>mean by gabbling over what you have to say, </p><p>like two women talking gossip. Out with it! </p><p>What does he come here for?” </p><p> “1 think it's Aunt Mollie,” said May Al-</p><p>lardvce softly. </p><p> For one moment Colonel Borden looked</p><p>long at his pretty niece. It was a long, </p><p>196 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>steady look during which Miss Allardyce </p><p>wondered vaguely if he were on the verge </p><p>of a paralytic stroke. As he strove vainly </p><p>for speech his face was as red as the crest </p><p>of an angry turkey gobbler. </p><p> There was nothing for him to say, how-</p><p>ever, and Miss Allardyce, when she thought </p><p>of her aunt, of whom she was really very </p><p>fond, figuring in a flirtation with a bachelor </p><p>lieutenant of cavalry; her aunt with the </p><p>stature and the mustache of a Wurttemberg </p><p>hussar; her aunt for his marriage with whom </p><p>it was vaguely whispered in the regiment </p><p>her uncle had been given his Medal of Hon- </p><p>or with its motto: “For Valor, ’ I say when </p><p>she thought of all this, Miss Allardyce burst </p><p>into soft laughter. </p><p> Colonel Borden boiled over with wrath.</p><p>He had come down to breakfast a half-hour</p><p>before in the worst possible temper, so that </p><p>the cook, noting it, took time to feed the </p><p>orderly first, so that when the inevitable </p><p>message should be sent to direct some one </p><p>to report to the colonel, the orderly at least </p><p>should not be hungry. She also cautioned </p><p>the orderly to look out for himself, strongly </p><p>advising him to be suddenly taken ill and </p><p>to go 011 sick report. </p><p> “Mind the weather this mornin’, Lewis.</p><p>Th’ ol’ man’s the divvle the day. Sure the </p><p>C. O. W. (which is army argot for Com- </p><p>manding Officer’s Wife) been givin’ him </p><p>what-for since she got up. Norah just told </p><p>me that they’ve been rowin’ again over Miss </p><p>May. Sure they always do. It’s a pity </p><p>they can’t let the girl alone. She’s more </p><p>sense’n the pair of ’em. Go on sick report </p><p>I tell you.” </p><p> ALL colonels of cavalry are pecu-</p><p>liar. That is an axiom. If it re- </p><p>quires proof, any subaltern of cav- </p><p>alry can give it—to the point of profanity. </p><p>Colonel Borden was no exception to the </p><p>rule. An irate troop commander, called </p><p>upon once to express his idea upon the rea- </p><p>son why so many Colonels were peculiar, </p><p>voiced the generally accepted belief in the </p><p>words: </p><p> “I’ll tell you why it is. It’s because</p><p>they’re driven crazy when they're captains. </p><p>That's why it is!" </p><p> He was an unbending martinet of the</p><p>severest school, which means the type which </p><p>can see no reason or excuse for any short- </p><p>coming in any one but himself. No man </p><p>resents severity provided only it be based </p><p>on justice. Injustice, severity and incom- </p><p>petence make a bad trinity and have broken </p><p>the backs of many competent juniors. </p><p> He was even worse than his officers called</p><p>him in the privacy of their own rooms for, </p><p>to the credit of that regiment be it said, </p><p>in public they upheld him. No higher </p><p>praise can be uttered. He was almost as </p><p>bad as the regimental Sergeant - Major </p><p>called him, which was singularly like a per- </p><p>sonage mentioned in the Book of Revela- </p><p>tions. </p><p> He was extremely close in money mat-</p><p>ters and was never known to entertain any- </p><p>one except the Department Commander on </p><p>the rare occasions of his visits to the Post; </p><p>but most of liis shortcomings were condoned </p><p>at least on account of his niece—May Allar- </p><p>dyce. </p><p> May Allardyce was young and May Al-</p><p>lardyce was more than a little pretty. E ven</p><p>the young married ladies of the regiment </p><p>said so and that is proof incontestable. </p><p>Also she possessed a quiet charm that made </p><p>even the more confirmed bachelors thin!: </p><p>twice about the doubtful advantage tha </p><p>they possessed in times of moving when all </p><p>they had to do was to pour water on the </p><p>fire and call the dog. Better still, if that </p><p>indeed was needed, May Allardyce would </p><p>be rich in her own right. </p><p> Her mother had been Colonel Borden’s</p><p>favorite sister. In so far as he could be </p><p>said to have shown affection for any one he </p><p>had shown it for his sister and for her hus- </p><p>band, Tom Allardyce, who, dying, left liis </p><p>wife the sole heir to his immense fortune. </p><p>Unfortunately, she soon followed her hus- </p><p>band, and when her will was read it was </p><p>found to contain the somewhat curious pro- </p><p>vision that while May was to have a com- </p><p>fortable income when she should come *f </p><p>age on her eighteenth birthday yet she </p><p>would not inherit the bulk of the property </p><p>in its entirety until she was twenty-one </p><p>years of age. </p><p> She was forbidden to marry before her</p><p>twenty-first birthday. </p><p> People, seeing her denied nothing that</p><p>money could buy, from the days of her first </p><p>living with the Borden’s, at first thought </p><p>that her luxuries were the outcome of </p><p>avuncular affection. No one knew that </p><p>Tom Allardyce had left nearly three millions </p><p>of dollars to the pretty little girl who was a </p><p>favorite with every one of the officers ant- </p><p>most of their wives. </p><p>The Salters </p><p>197 </p><p> As a matter of fact, it was not generally</p><p>known. Colonel Borden, her uncle, was </p><p>also her guardian, and he had no mind to </p><p>surrender, until the latest possible moment, </p><p>his stewardship over the pleasant little bun- </p><p>galow on Chesapeake Bay that boasted the </p><p>finest duck-shooting on the Eastern waters, </p><p>nor the cottage at Palm Beach where he </p><p>could have as guests men whose words </p><p>would mean much if he should ever desire </p><p>a pleasant detail in Washington, the Mecca </p><p>of old officers. </p><p> Thus is it done. Kissing goes by favor</p><p>and there are man)'- kinds of kisses. He re- </p><p>turned to the charge: </p><p> “I fail to see why you want that ‘Shave-</p><p>tail’ ”—a generic army title for an officer </p><p>of less than five years’ service, derived prob- </p><p>ably from the fact that when young mules </p><p>are first purchased for the service, the con-</p><p>tractor has their tails shaved to tell them </p><p>from the other mules—“hanging around you </p><p>all day. Why don’t you like Captain </p><p>Evans?” </p><p> “He has had two wives, Uncle Jim-”</p><p> “The fatal gift of beauty,” said her uncle</p><p>savagely. Evans was so ugly that it was a </p><p>common report in the regiment that even </p><p>his own dog ran away from him. </p><p> “Striker then?”</p><p> “He has white eyes and he sniffles-”</p><p> “Johnson then. Ha! You’ve got noth-</p><p>ing to say, have you? What fault can you </p><p>find with Mr. Johnson?” </p><p> Case-hardened as May Allardyce was to</p><p>her uncle’s unpleasantnesses even she lacked </p><p>courage to tell her uncle that her chief ob- </p><p>jection to Mr. Johnson lay in the fact that </p><p>he was known to be the Colonel’s pet and </p><p>was strongly suspected of being a tale-bear- </p><p>er. Let a man once get that reputation in </p><p>the army; let him once be known as a </p><p>“boot-licker”—one who curries favor by </p><p>adroitly pandering to the weaknesses of a </p><p>superior—and that man had better hang </p><p>himself. </p><p>MAY ALLARDYCE, her break- </p><p>fast finished, sat contemplatingly </p><p>eying her uncle as he fussed about </p><p>the room, picking up a cigar here, a paper </p><p>there, and when he stamped out upon the </p><p>sunlit porch with a testy call of, “Orderly!’' </p><p>she breathed a sigh of relief. </p><p> Mr. Needham, a hundred yards farther</p><p>down t he Line, as Officers’ Line is commonly </p><p>called, standing discreetly on the off side of </p><p> his horse, busied himself with a refractory</p><p> stirrup-leather till he saw the broad back of</p><p> his superior disappear in the administra-</p><p> tion building, when he walked lightly</p><p> up the Line and entered the forbidden</p><p> ground.</p><p> “No poaching, please. Uncle is as mad as</p><p> —as—” May stopped for a simile. “Oh,</p><p> Gerald, he said all kinds of nasty things this</p><p> morning. He’s awful-”</p><p> “Of course he is. Show me the man who</p><p> denies it.”</p><p> Mr. Needham promptly drew the girl be-</p><p> hind the sheltering vines that massed on the</p><p> end of the porch. What took place under</p><p> those vines is no business of yours or of mine,</p><p> but Mrs. Fantcr, who lived next door, nearly</p><p> got a stiff neck through twisting her hea l</p><p> around the corner of her sitting-room window</p><p> to get a clear look. She found that she</p><p> could not see them from her bedroom.</p><p> “It’s perfectly disgusting,” she declaimed</p><p> to her bosom friend, Mrs. Burr. “My dear,</p><p> I sat and watched them for twenty minutes.</p><p> Every one knows that he is crazy about her</p><p> and that she has just tfung herself at his</p><p> head. Every one knows that Colonel Bor-</p><p> den hates young Mr. Needham and that he</p><p> will not allow any one but his own pets to</p><p> show May any attentions. No, my dear. I</p><p> must say I do not think she is exactly pretty</p><p> —and there they stood for a half hour. I</p><p> saw them as plainly as I see you this min-</p><p> ute. He had his arms about her and her</p><p> head was on his shoulder and he was kiss-</p><p> ing her. Simply disgusting, I call it-”</p><p> The episode under the vines, however,</p><p>that so upset Mrs. Fanter did not affect </p><p>Needham seriously. Fifteen minutes later </p><p>Miss Allardyce reappeared, very flushed as </p><p>to her countenance, and very bright as to </p><p>the eyes. </p><p> “I tell you, darling,” quoth Mr. Need-</p><p> ham, ‘ I do not want to be disrespectful in</p><p> speaking of your uncle, but he is an old</p><p> devil-”</p><p> “He is! He is worse than that, if I could</p><p> only think of what to call him.”</p><p> He is very foolish. Even- one knows</p><p>that he is trying to make you accept the at- </p><p>tentions of his own favorites here: Evans— </p><p>he s a nice enough fellow—or Striker—or </p><p>Johnson. It is a purely personal dislike </p><p>that he has taken to me and he will not ad- </p><p>mit that he is wrong. There is nothing that </p><p>he can show against me or against mv </p><p>record.” </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Just let him try it—just once!” said</p><p>May viciously. </p><p> Her pretty cliin went up in air. Needharn</p><p>laughed lightly, </p><p> “I’m going to propose formally to you—</p><p>Sweetheart, will you marry me?” he asked </p><p>quietly, his gleaming eyes belying the quiet- </p><p>ness. </p><p> “Of course I will.”</p><p> She leaned lightly toward him and he</p><p>took both hands in his, raising them to hi3 </p><p>lips and kissing the rosy tinted palms. </p><p> “Then—mind you, darling, it will be un-</p><p>pleasant for us both—I am going straight </p><p>to your uncle and ask him for his consent </p><p>to our engagement. He is sure to say no, </p><p>but that doesn't make the least difference </p><p>in the world. If he says no, he has to give </p><p>a reason. He is certain to be unpleasant to </p><p>me and probably to you, but we can not </p><p>have things go on in this way any </p><p>longer. It is not fair to either of us. The</p><p>first thing we know some of these old </p><p>cats'll be talking about you, and I do not </p><p>propose to have any one talking about my </p><p>wife.” </p><p> She colored warmly at the proud posses-</p><p>sion of the tone but nodded brightly. </p><p> “I didn’t think you would have the cour-</p><p>age/' she said lightly. </p><p> "Courage? I? Why I’d charge hell with</p><p>a bucket of water for you! Meet me in an </p><p>hour at the tennis-court. Will you—just </p><p>one-” </p><p> That “one” multiplied by ten being com-</p><p>pleted and a very thoro uglily kissed </p><p>young lady having vanished into the </p><p>house, Gerald Needham went jauntily to </p><p>the office. </p><p> If the red face of the orderly standing</p><p>just outside the door of the Holy of Holies </p><p>had not informed him that the official ba- </p><p>rometer of courtesy registered low that </p><p>morning, Needham would have read it the </p><p>moment he stepped inside the door of the </p><p>adjutant’s office, which led to the. Colonel’s </p><p>room, for the adjutant, his face bent low </p><p>over his desk, was red to the top of his </p><p>scalp and he toiled with a fervor that </p><p>was too feverish to have lasted long. He </p><p>looked up as Needham, with a cheerful: </p><p>“Hello, Burke! What’s new?” entered the </p><p>room. </p><p> liSsht Ss/i/” cautioned the shocked ad-</p><p>jutant. </p><p> “WTiat’s the matter? Anybody dead?”</p><p>queried the unimpressed Needham. </p><p> “Shut up, you -fool! The old man’s</p><p>on the rampage this morning.’ </p><p> “Ah! And I suppose every one in the</p><p>whole rouud world must tremble and kow- </p><p>tow until it pleases his august majesty to </p><p>shed the light of his countenance upon us </p><p>once again. Hence, slave, and tell tbv mas- </p><p>ter I defy him. Give him my gage—it s </p><p>twelve-bore—double choked sirct l’ve been </p><p>here! Sigi Da gup an, Burke, there’s a good </p><p>chap. Tell the old man that I’d like a few </p><p>moments’ conversation with him. That is, I </p><p>mean I want a chance to do about two min- </p><p>utes' talking myself. Not for him to do it. </p><p>As I said, Burke, sigi Dagupan/” </p><p> 'That word, or expression rather, has been</p><p>the sliibboleth of the new army. By which </p><p>I mean the army that had its beginning in </p><p>1898. </p><p> CAPTAIN BURKE disappeared</p><p>into the inner office whence an omi- </p><p>" nous clearing of the throat, which </p><p>was to the Colonel what the rasping threat</p><p>chuckle at the sight of fre&gt;h meat is to the </p><p>cage-born lion, announced that the Old </p><p>Man was ready for a meal. Needham en- </p><p>tered. </p><p> “Good morning, sir.”</p><p> “Hm! What do you want? To see me?”</p><p>“No.sir. To speak to you fora moment.’’ </p><p>“Well, you will have to be quick.. sir. </p><p>Don't you see I am busy?" </p><p> “So am I, sir. I will not take more than</p><p>a few minutes of your time. I have come, </p><p>Colonel Borden, to speak to you on a pri- </p><p>vate matter. I wish to ask vour consent </p><p>to my marriage to your niece- </p><p> For three long minutes an awful silence</p><p>reigned, a silence that was broken only by </p><p>the ticking of the office clock and by the </p><p>shuffling of papers in the office of the ad- </p><p>jutant. </p><p> Needham looked at his superior with</p><p>some curiosity. Colonel Borden was al- </p><p>most bursting with illy suppressed rage, his </p><p>face mottled red and white like a well-mar- </p><p>blcd piece of ham as he stared at Needham </p><p>from behind his desk. Presently: </p><p> “What—? What—? Mr. Needham, sir!</p><p>This is the most UDparalelled piece of im- </p><p>pertinence that even you have ever been </p><p>guilty of--” </p><p> Needham’s eyes grew steely in their in-</p><p>tensity and his mouth set in tense, clean- </p><p>cut lines. Any one who knew him could </p><p>have told Colonel Borden what that look </p><p>The Salters </p><p>199 </p><p>meant. His voice was as sweet as strained </p><p>honey, but there was a ring in it that </p><p>meant fight. </p><p> “Colonel Borden, I must inform you with</p><p>all respect that I permit no man living to </p><p>speak to me in this way. I have come to </p><p>you to prefer a formal request because that </p><p>form is prescribed by convention. I knew </p><p>when I came what your answer would be. </p><p>That makes no difference. I shall not per- </p><p>mit you to insult me. My record, both per- </p><p>sonal and official, is clean except for one </p><p>slurring remark that you yourself placed </p><p>upon my efficiency report which an in- </p><p>spector decided was the result of personal </p><p>prejudice on your part. My income is the </p><p>income of any officer of my grade. I am not </p><p>in debt a cent. Miss Allardyce has honored </p><p>me by-V </p><p> “Leave my office, sir!”</p><p> “I warn you, sir. One more word in that</p><p>tone and manner and I will request an offi- </p><p>cial investigation of you and your methods</p><p>by an Inspector General. I will not allow </p><p>you to be discourteous to me simply be- </p><p>cause you think that you can get away </p><p>with it because you are a Colonel and I a </p><p>mere lieutenant so unfortunate as to be </p><p>placed under your command. Is your an- </p><p>swer ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ sir?” </p><p> “No! No! A thousand times no, sir!</p><p>You are not to speak to her again. Do you </p><p>understand that?” </p><p> “One moment, Colonel Borden. You</p><p>seem to strangely misunderstand both your </p><p>position and my own. If I have done any- </p><p>thing to merit such a diatribe as you </p><p>have favored me with, I merit a trial. I </p><p>know very well, sir, that if you had the </p><p>slightest grounds for preferring charges </p><p>against me you would have done so long </p><p>ago. So long as I am who I am and my </p><p>record such as it is, I shall insist on and re- </p><p>quire, sir, from you the same courtesy that </p><p>I in turn am required to show. As for your </p><p>consent to our marriage, I never expected </p><p>you to give it. I asked it as mere formality, </p><p>and I tell you frankly, sir, that as soon as </p><p>May is twenty-one, next month, we intend </p><p>to be married either with or without that </p><p>consent. Good morning, sir!” </p><p> He stepped out into the hall and, meet-</p><p>ing the white-faced orderly, whose mouth </p><p>was lianging open like the mouth of a fish, </p><p>lie realized that every- word of his conver- </p><p>sation had been overheard and would be </p><p>common property by noon. </p><p>Ill </p><p>RJjj! GERALD NEEDHAM went to his </p><p>ImuS quarters in a dangerously quiet </p><p>mood. Furiously angry as he was, </p><p>he was quite aware of the fact that the </p><p>slightest false move on his part now would </p><p>bring Colonel Borden upon him, as he ex- </p><p>pressed it, “Like a duck on a June bug.!: </p><p> So far, his own demeanor and conduct</p><p>had been perfectly correct and within the </p><p>spirit and the letter of the regulations, but </p><p>he knew that if he should make the least </p><p>slip from the standard of official correct- </p><p>ness he would receive no mercy. Evans, </p><p>Striker, Johnson, could miss morning sta- </p><p>bles, be late for drill, forget to sign the </p><p>book for official papers, and nothing would </p><p>happen; but let him do one of these sins </p><p>and he would figure as the accused before </p><p>a General Court-martial. Now, however, </p><p>that open war had been declared, he knew </p><p>where he stood and could prepare for any </p><p>move of the enemy. </p><p> The first move came when, being en-</p><p>gaged in changing from riding-boots to ten- </p><p>nis shoes, he heard a knock at the door. A </p><p>sprucely clad orderly entered at the shout- </p><p>ed, “Come in.” </p><p> “I have a paper here, sir, for the lieu-</p><p>tenant.” </p><p> Needham took the paper, signed the book</p><p>and opened the envelope. It was a type- </p><p>written order on which the ink was not yet </p><p>dry and it read: </p><p> 1st Lt. Gerald Needham, 161b Cav., and ten men</p><p>will procced at once, mounted, to the International </p><p>Boundary Line west of. and in the vicinity of. Pre- </p><p>ciosa for the purpose of enforcing the Neutrality </p><p>Laws. </p><p> Rations for thirty days will be taken.</p><p> The detachment will taLe no tentage but shelter</p><p>tents. </p><p> By order of Col. Borden</p><p> John Burke</p><p> Capt. 16th Cav.</p><p> Adjutant.</p><p> "Darn his old skin! First move to him.</p><p>This is the first time in the history of this </p><p>Post that an officer has had to go into the </p><p>field without a tent. He’d send me out </p><p>naked if he dared.” </p><p> “Sir, the adjutant directed me to tell</p><p>the lieutenant that Sergeant Wilson has </p><p>been directed to report to him for orders. </p><p>The Commanding Officer directs that the </p><p>lieutenant leave iifan hour.” </p><p>“Ali right. There is no reply, orderly.” </p><p>200 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The soldier saluted and left, passing, as he</p><p>went out, Sergeant Wilson, who was com- </p><p>ing up the steps to get his orders. </p><p> “All right, sergeant. I know aJl about it.</p><p>Tell the first sergeant to make the detail </p><p>and notify the men yourself so they can </p><p>get ready. Tell the quartermaster, ser- </p><p>geant, to pack at once thirty days’ rations </p><p>for eleven men and overhaul the pack-sad- </p><p>dles and look over the mules. You will need </p><p>seven pack-mules. The forage will be sent </p><p>by wagon, of course. We will leave in an </p><p>hour. Have the trumpeter saddle my </p><p>horse and bring him to the door in half an </p><p>hour.” </p><p> Sergeant Wilson saluted and departed</p><p>and Needham set to work rolling up his </p><p>bedding, filling his flask and canteen and </p><p>packing up what few little luxuries he could </p><p>carry that would make life more endurable </p><p>on that hell-hole of a border. </p><p> He well knew what his life would be. He</p><p>had been there before for two months in</p><p>very nearly the same locality. He would </p><p>make his camp as near water as he could, </p><p>and the nearer to it he got, the more trouble </p><p>would he have with the cattle stampeding </p><p>in from the range to get at the water. </p><p>Twice he had had his own horses stampeded </p><p>by it, costing him two days of hard work to </p><p>get them again. </p><p> For a mile around his camp the ground</p><p>would be covered with the dead bodies of </p><p>cattle that had died within the past year </p><p>in their attempt to get to water, only too </p><p>often dying when in sight of it, but too </p><p>weak to reach it. He would have flies, </p><p>thousands of them, almost as big as spar- </p><p>rows, bred in those same dead cattle. He </p><p>would be afHictcd with dust-storms that </p><p>would follow him around by day and go to </p><p>bed with him at night. He would exist in </p><p>a temperature of never less than 100 de- </p><p>grees, and he would learn all over again to </p><p>smoke tobacco that was half wind-blown </p><p>cow-dung. </p><p> That would be by day. By night it would</p><p>be different, for as soon as the darkness </p><p>should shut down and the sun drop below </p><p>the saw-toothed range of the raw, red, </p><p>Western hills there would come a wind out </p><p>of the desert—a raw cold wind that would </p><p>drive the men inside their tiny shelter-tents </p><p>for very warmth, where they would shiver </p><p>in their clothes and one blanket till sun-up. </p><p> There would be alarms from people un-</p><p>heard of about parties unknown who were </p><p>always just about to cross the border with </p><p>arms and ammunition but who never got </p><p>there. The point where they were to cross </p><p>the line would always be ten miles distant. </p><p>He would be riding and roasting by day and </p><p>freezing and shivering by night for a month, </p><p>striving to enforce laws that no one knew/ </p><p>HIS orders given, his bedding-roll </p><p>placed upon the porch where the </p><p>packers could get it when the mules </p><p>were ready, he buckled on his revolver and </p><p>went to the tennis-court where May was </p><p>waiting for him. She caught sight of him </p><p>when he was a hundred yards away and </p><p>ran toward him, swinging her racket. </p><p> “What’s the matter—-dear?” she almost</p><p>whispered, seeing him in field garb. "Is </p><p>there any trouble?” </p><p> “Only for us. I'm sorry to say—sweet-</p><p>heart.” His voice lingered over the sweet- </p><p>est word in the English language, and he </p><p>caught the hand that held the racket, care- </p><p>less of who might see. </p><p> “Your respected and revered old uncle</p><p>has seen fit to send me an order sendir g </p><p>me to Preciosa on field duty for a month.” </p><p>“What? Why, Gerald, you only came </p><p>back last month. You can't be next on the </p><p>roster. Arc you?” </p><p> “Of course not. There are five lieuten-</p><p>ants here who have not been out at all. </p><p>It’s because I had the temerity to fall in </p><p>love with vou.” </p><p> “What?”</p><p> Needham nodded.</p><p> “He was so mad," he said, grinning at</p><p>the recollection, “that I thought for a mo- </p><p>ment he was going to burst. I remember </p><p>being grateful for the fact that he did not </p><p>burst on me!” </p><p> “What did he say, Gerald?'1 asked Miss</p><p>Allardyce, giggling.	n</p><p> “Pardon me. 1 never use such language.</p><p>“Tell me at once—dear!’’ she entreated, </p><p>half tearfully. Needham relented. </p><p> “He said a lot of things. First he said:</p><p>'No, No, No/ five or six times; then he said </p><p>the first word ol ‘God Save the King and </p><p>mixed that up with a lot of plain, ordinary </p><p>words in which I understood him to express </p><p>a positive conviction as to my ultimate des- </p><p>tiny. He was rather comprehensive in his </p><p>statements and he was so mad that I ex- </p><p>pected to see him burst into a blare. I only </p><p>cot the order a few minutes ago. I go to </p><p>Preciosa." </p><p>The Salters </p><p>201 </p><p> “What did you tell him, Gerald?”</p><p> “I told him that I was asking him for his</p><p>permission to marry you because I thought </p><p>it was the proper thing to make a request </p><p>like tiiat, but that I was going to marry </p><p>you whether he liked it or not just as soon </p><p>as you are twenty-one years of age.” </p><p> “You dear—I think I’d like to kiss you,</p><p>Gerald. I think he’s perfectly horrid, but </p><p>I’m not going to let him see it.” </p><p> She thought for a moment, then, slipping</p><p>her hand under his arm, she pulled him </p><p>lightly under the shade of a giant cotton- </p><p>wood tree that shaded the court. </p><p> “Gerald,” she said presently, “I am going</p><p>to speak seriously for a moment. Have we </p><p>been simply flirting with each other to pass </p><p>away the time?” </p><p> The youngster’s face whitened slowly un-</p><p>der her words. He looked at her steadily </p><p>for a moment, his eyes narrowing to pin- </p><p>points. He noted the quick, warm flush </p><p>that mounted from cheek to brow and he </p><p>saw her eyes, wrhich were as the eyes of a</p><p>bride, and his own face cleared. </p><p> “You know better,” he said simply.</p><p>“You know, dear heart, that it is for ever </p><p>and ever.” </p><p> “Then before you go away today, write</p><p>a request for a leave of absence for four </p><p>months to take effect a month from Tues- </p><p>day. Tuesday will be the eighteenth. Can </p><p>you get it?” </p><p> “The old—I mean your uncle—will dis-</p><p>approve my request, of course; but what is </p><p>the use of having an uncle who is a United </p><p>States Senator if I can’t get a little thing </p><p>like that. Certainly I can get it. Why? </p><p>What is your plan?” </p><p> The girl flushed again, even more warm-</p><p>ly than before. </p><p> “I thought,” she said in an embarrass-</p><p>ment that was delightful to see, “that a </p><p>month from Tuesday will be the eighteenth </p><p>and that is my birthday. I will be twenty- </p><p>one and no longer under Uncle Jim's con- </p><p>trol. Well—then—then—if you really want </p><p> She had no opportunity to finish her</p><p>speech, for long before she could say any </p><p>more she found herself gathered into a pair </p><p>of brown-shirted arms, her lovely, blushing </p><p>face hidden beneath the brim of his cam- </p><p>paign hat. </p><p> Twenty minutes later, having received</p><p>his final orders from the adjutant, Need- </p><p>ham left the Post with his little detachment, </p><p>and threading the narrow dust-ribbon of a </p><p>trail, with his pack-mules well closed up </p><p>ahead of him, pulled out on the trail for </p><p>Preciosa. </p><p> He had hastily written a letter request-</p><p>ing a leave of absence for four months, so </p><p>his conscience was perfectly clear on that </p><p>point, though he knew right well that Colo- </p><p>nel Borden would never approve it, and for </p><p>the first part of the ride he was busily fra- </p><p>ming mentally a night letter to be sent from </p><p>Preciosa, when he should get an opportunity, </p><p>to United States Senator James Needham </p><p>which was calculated to make t/iat gentle- </p><p>man sit up and rub his head. </p><p>IT WAS not a long ride as rides go, </p><p>only twenty miles, but the road was </p><p>dusty beyond the power of words </p><p>to describe and there was no scenery. He </p><p>knew it of old. The chug, chug, chug of the </p><p>walking horses in the dust, varied by an </p><p>occasional short trot where the prairie-dog </p><p>holes were fewest, till finally the)’ topped </p><p>the last divide from which they could </p><p>see Preciosa, a brown blot on a browner </p><p>plain.</p><p> It is only in novels that cavalry moves</p><p>at a gallop. On a campaign or in the field </p><p>even- cavalryman knows that luck is on his </p><p>side if he can always move his entire troop </p><p>at a walk. To be able to walk and trot </p><p>equally is the gift of the gods. </p><p> He was glad when they drew up in the</p><p>dust of the corral and dismounted to water </p><p>the horses at ten cents a head. Mr. Wilkes </p><p>met him at the pump, greeting him with a </p><p>toothless grin. </p><p> “Hello, son. Just in from the Post?”</p><p> “Yep. Hello, Mr. Wilkes. Glad to see</p><p>you. What’s new?" </p><p> “Greaser baby over at Juan Morcllo’s is</p><p>the newest thing I know of, but vou ain't </p><p>interested in that—not yit, hey?" </p><p> “No. Any arms around here. Any talk</p><p>of smuggling?” </p><p> Mr. Wilkes flung his arms wide.</p><p> “Good Lord, Lieutenant. You know as</p><p>well as me what’s here. There ain’t nothin'. </p><p>Now if we only had water—we could do </p><p>anything if we had water. If we only had </p><p>one-inch rainfall in a whole year we could </p><p>raise all kinds of vegetables.” </p><p> Needham iooked his disbelief. Mr.</p><p>Wilkes snorted. </p><p> "Oh, we kin. You needn’t look like that.</p><p>Some day we’ll irrigate this place an’ then </p><p>202 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>we’ll show the world. Do you know Broad- </p><p>Ax Smith up at Pestilente?” </p><p> “No. Why?”</p><p> “He bought a thousand acres of land last</p><p>year fer twenty dollars an’ he sunk a three- </p><p>inch pipe well fer two thousand dollars. It </p><p>irrigated exactly one acre. Son, he started </p><p>in to raise vegetables an’ he’s raised stuff </p><p>enough otTen that one acre to pay fer all the </p><p>rest. He carted the greens over to the rail- </p><p>road an’ sold ’em to the eatin’-houses an’ </p><p>he was makin’ the dollars just roll in when </p><p>one of his burros turned hisself loose an’ </p><p>kicked out four of Broad-Ax’s front teeth. </p><p>When they growed in again-” </p><p> “Oh, here! A man’s front teeth don’t</p><p>grow in again-” </p><p> "Son, I'm a-tellin’ you this here story to</p><p>teach you somethin’. You kin raise any- </p><p>thing here in Arizona if you’ll only irrigate? </p><p>The doctor had Broad-Ax irrigatin’ his </p><p>mouth fer three weeks— Where you </p><p>goin'?” </p><p> "To buy you a drink, you old pirate.</p><p>Come on." </p><p> Mr. Wilkes followed him inside the store</p><p>and set forUi a gaudily dressed bottle that </p><p>was labelled "Cow-punchers’ Delight.” </p><p>“Where’re you goin’ to camp, son?” he </p><p>asked over the drinks. </p><p> “Over by Dailey’s place, I reckon. The</p><p>same old place. I reckon that’s the nearest </p><p>place to water.” </p><p> “Yep. That's right. An’, say, Lieuten-</p><p>ant, while you’re over there you keep a </p><p>good look-out. There’s been some cattle </p><p>rustlin’ bein’ done over there lately. Boaz </p><p>an' Dailey has lost quite a lot of Hereford </p><p>catUe that they was keepin’ up in the pas- </p><p>ture, an’ they've got a lot of hosses in there </p><p>now. They claim them greaser soldiers </p><p>come across the line an’ cut the fence an’ </p><p>run the cattle otT. If they done that with </p><p>cattle, they’ll do it a lot quicker fi r hosses. </p><p>They need them fer their cavalry, you know. </p><p>The line's only five hundred yards from </p><p>their fence-corner.” </p><p> “Hml I’m sorry to hear they lost any</p><p>stock. I'll do what I can to prevent it in </p><p>the future. When you see Dailey and Boaz, </p><p>Mr. Wilkes, teLl ’em to come over an’ see </p><p>me, will you?" </p><p> "I will so. Good-by. Vaya con Dios, as</p><p>the greasers say.” </p><p> Needham shook hands with him and</p><p>rode oil to the westward with his men. Mr. </p><p>Wilkes stood looking after him for a mo- </p><p>ment till he faded away, swallowed up by </p><p>the swirling dust. </p><p> “He’s a good youngster,” he said reflec-</p><p>tively; “a good youngster. I wish there was </p><p>more like him down here.” </p><p>IV </p><p>L Ji THE line runs due east and west </p><p>from Preciosa, and they made their </p><p>camp a mile to the west, where the </p><p>corner of the wire fence that enclosed the </p><p>great two-thousand-acre pasture where </p><p>Dailey and Boajs kept their stock, was </p><p>within five hundred yards of the inter- </p><p>national line. </p><p> At that point the boundary was marked</p><p>by a great sheet-iron monument standing </p><p>upon a small, rocky hill. The monument </p><p>was marked upon its northern face with the </p><p>arms of the United States of America, while </p><p>the southern face showed the eagle, stand- </p><p>on a cactus, grasping a serpent in its talons, </p><p>the symbol of Mexican supremacy since the </p><p>days when in 1325 the Acolhuaos over-ran </p><p>the country from the north. </p><p> It was not an imposing camp. Five</p><p>shelter tents standing in one line, spreading </p><p>their brown canvas to the sun, showed</p><p>where the ten men sk‘pt. At one end of this </p><p>line was the improvised kitchen, made by </p><p>simply scraping a narrow trench in th«. dir*, </p><p>the length lying in the direction of the pre- </p><p>vailing winds; at the other end of the line </p><p>stood the shelter tent where Needham slept </p><p>and in front of the line of tents lay the </p><p>‘‘griund-Line,” two lariats stretched between </p><p>two stunted mesquit bushes where the </p><p>horses and the mules were tied. </p><p> The water-hole was about a hundred yards</p><p>to the north. For work they could ride for </p><p>fifty miles over the inhospitable brown mesa </p><p>that lay like an oven under the semi- </p><p>tropical sun; for diversion they could watch </p><p>the prairie dogs that yip-yapped inces- </p><p>santlv, ducking into their holes at the first </p><p>sign of life from the camp. </p><p> "Four men will remain in camp all the</p><p>time, sergeant. We will have to have some </p><p>one here permanently to look after the </p><p>stock. There will be three patrols to go out </p><p>daily. One of two men will ride east for </p><p>about ten miles and one will ride west about </p><p>ten miles, returning by sundown. The </p><p>other two men will watch the railroad ani </p><p>the station at Preciosa. Who s that coming </p><p>in now?” </p><p>The Salters </p><p>203 </p><p> “It’s me, Dailey, Lieutenant. How are</p><p>you?” </p><p> The cowpuncher rode up to the cook-fire</p><p>and dismounted, leaving liis rein-chains </p><p>dangling. He strode forward with out- </p><p>stretched hand, for he knew Needham and </p><p>liked him, as did most men who came in con- </p><p>tact with him. </p><p> “You're the very man I wanted most to</p><p>see, Dailey. John Wilkes told me that you </p><p>and. Boaz have lost some stock lately. Is </p><p>it true?” </p><p> “Yes. It was about a month ago. We</p><p>had driven in a lot of Hereford cattle to </p><p>fatten up, an’ had ’em corralled in the big </p><p>pasture 3'onder. That’s what I’ve come to </p><p>speak to you about. The fence was cut by </p><p>some Mexicans and some of the stock was </p><p>run off. I think a man named Lopez was </p><p>mixed up in it. He was a man we fired </p><p>some time ago on suspicion. There’s no </p><p>question about it, Lieutenant; they do </p><p>run stock off here an’ take it across the </p><p>border. They sneak over at night, some- </p><p>times bringin’ cattle over that they swap </p><p>off here to some of the Mexican residents </p><p>for stolen ponies. Sometimes they don’t </p><p>trouble to bring no cattle along. The)' just</p><p>naturally pinch the ponies, payin’ fer ’em </p><p>with the loose end of a lariat.” </p><p> “Have you any idea how they do it?”</p><p> “Mostly they cut our fence an’ steal</p><p>some outen our herd. You see our boun- </p><p>dary fences run down like the letter V, with </p><p>the point right here, not more'n five hun- </p><p>dred yards from the line. Naturally they </p><p>cut it right at the point. That’s because a </p><p>horse, if he’s stampeded, runs straight to the </p><p>rear. If they cut it on the long side, the </p><p>horses might git scared an’ scatter. If they </p><p>cut it at the point an' the horses scare, </p><p>they’ll just run back in the pasture. You </p><p>kin count on it that if they do come over </p><p>an’ try to cut the fence they’ll do it right </p><p>here. More’n that, the grass has been </p><p>burned off near the water-hole an’ with the </p><p>new grass cornin’ up here all the herd'll be </p><p>grazin’ right down here. If you’ll just </p><p>watch this fence you’ll see somethin’, I </p><p>think.” </p><p> “I’ll do better than that, Dailey-”</p><p> “You see, Lieutenant, if they run any</p><p>stock off, they’ll run ’em off along the low- </p><p>land in the bottom.” He pointed to the </p><p>“draw,” as lowland is generally called in the </p><p>Southwest, in which lay the water-hole. </p><p>"They won’t dare lake the cattle over the </p><p>hilltops. Your men’d see ’em against the </p><p>skyline. You needn’t worry none. They </p><p>won’t try it till full moon, an’ that’s two </p><p>weeks away yit. I’ll sit down awhile if you </p><p>don’t mind. Boaz’s gone up into the foot- </p><p>hills to round up some cattle.” </p><p> So down he sat and talked late into the</p><p>night. Rough as he was, he had a keen </p><p>sense of humor and a stock of stories of the </p><p>range that, told with Rabelaisian humor, </p><p>moved Needham to laughter so that he was </p><p>genuinely sorry when his guest rose. </p><p> “I’ll see you soon again,' Dailey said as</p><p>he swung into saddle. “Me an’ Boaz’ll be </p><p>ove^ often. Adios </p><p> Needham, still smiling over the last story,</p><p>sat listening to the patter of his pony’s feet </p><p>among the rocks till the last echoes died </p><p>away in the night. </p><p>THE next day, after much thought, </p><p>he sent a man with a pack-mule into </p><p>Preciosa on a mission that greatly </p><p>puzzled that hard-riding trooper. Need- </p><p>ham wanted six empty coal-oil cans. </p><p> A great light dawned upon the detach-</p><p>ment when they were called upon to hang </p><p>the cans to the top wire of the wire fence, </p><p>one empty can near each post near the point </p><p>of the V. In each can Needham placed a</p><p>great rock. </p><p> “I learned it in the Moro country," he</p><p>deigned to explain. “A man always cuts a </p><p>wire fence near the post. I don't know why, </p><p>but he does. Well, when he cuts the wire, </p><p>the can'll drop an’ the rock in it'll make </p><p>enough noise to wake the dead. You’ll be </p><p>able to hear it all over camp. That'll do, </p><p>Brown.” </p><p> Day after day the patrols rode the line</p><p>vigilantly. Day after day they returned </p><p>hot and dusty, longing for the cool beer that </p><p>the temperance people, in that outburst of </p><p>fanatical enthusiasm that leads people to </p><p>deny to others what they themselves do not </p><p>like, had forbidden them. </p><p> Each day, too, brought its new baseless</p><p>rumor. Once word came that a flying ma- </p><p>chine was about to smuggle field-guns </p><p>across the line to the rebels. Needham </p><p>got word of it by a personal note sent by </p><p>Colonel Borden himself and the orderly </p><p>nearly killed his horse to get the note in </p><p>promptly. Him the men jeered openly. </p><p>Again a report came'that bombs were being </p><p>shipped across the line packed in firewood </p><p>and carried on the backs of burros. There </p><p>204 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>being no firewood nearer than Fort Stevens, </p><p>the report was discounted. </p><p> With the waxing of the moon, however,</p><p>he grew more cautious; but it was not until </p><p>one night about two weeks after his arrival </p><p>that anything actually happened. </p><p> His letter requesting his four months’</p><p>leave of absence had been returned to him </p><p>bearing the one word, “Disapproved.” The </p><p>Colonel had evidently written it himself, </p><p>and the very period after the word ex- </p><p>pressed ire. Needham, expecting no less, </p><p>upon receiving the letter, saddled his horse </p><p>and rode in to Preciosa to send the night </p><p>letter to his uncle. The message des- </p><p>patched and its urgency explained, he was </p><p>walking his horse slowly along the moonlit </p><p>road when his quick ear caught the unmis- </p><p>takable sound of iron striking against rock. </p><p>He reined in his horse in the shadow of a </p><p>mesquit bush. </p><p> Clear and distinct above him, he saw sil-</p><p>houetted against the skyline the heads of </p><p>two men, sombrero-covered, leaning toward </p><p>each other in talk. A moment later, as he </p><p>watched, he saw two lean horses’ heads </p><p>come into view over the hilltop above the </p><p>trail. </p><p> The sound of the hoof-beats on the rocks</p><p>ceased. Once he heard an impatient stamp- </p><p>ing among the rocks and the jingle of bit- </p><p>rings, then a voice that said in clear, sono- </p><p>rous Spanish: </p><p> “Alio! El hijo de la-”</p><p> Needham heard no more and it was just as</p><p>well that he did not hear it. He knew the </p><p>Mexican people well enough to be able to </p><p>fill in the hiatus, for there are no fouler- </p><p>swearing people on earth than the Spanish- </p><p>speaking peoples. Compared with Spanish </p><p>even Arabic, which is said to be a language </p><p>specially devised for the use of the afflicted, </p><p>becomes mere childish prattle. </p><p> The two men were on the trail between</p><p>him and his camp. If they were engaged </p><p>in an attempt to run off cattle or stock, he </p><p>was convinced that the two men had been </p><p>placed so far out in order that they could </p><p>give the alarm if any one came along the </p><p>trail from the direction of Preciosa. The </p><p>main attempt would be made nearer to the </p><p>camp itself, just as Dailey had prophesied. </p><p> Either of two courses was open to him.</p><p>He could gallop down the trail toward his </p><p>camp, taking the chance of a shot as he rode, </p><p>or he could sneak up to the hillside above </p><p>the trail and work along the crest till he had </p><p>passed the two men, when he could regain </p><p>his camp. He chose the latter and, dis- </p><p>mounting, he led his horse straight up the </p><p>hillside down which the two men had come, </p><p>keeping off the rocks as well as he could in </p><p>the darkness. </p><p> Up, up, up he worked as slowly and as</p><p>carefully as a scout works in war-time when </p><p>developing a ridge that is suspected of hi- </p><p>ding a foe. Once a step of his horse sent a </p><p>volley of shale rock clattering down the </p><p>slope, making noise enough to wake the </p><p>dead. A horse whinnied in the darkness </p><p>and only his quick grasp on the nostrils of </p><p>his own steed kept him from replying. He </p><p>stood in perfect silence for a moment, hold- </p><p>ing up one forefoot of his horse so that he </p><p>should not make any noise by pawing the </p><p>loose shale of the hillside. </p><p> A deep-toned voice down on the trail said</p><p>clearly: </p><p> “Es nada. Nada pcro un conejo—It is</p><p>nothing but a rabbit—Alerla!—Be quick!’’ </p><p> And again he worked his way along the</p><p>hillside. </p><p> HE HAD reached a point on the</p><p> hillside almost directly opposite his</p><p> own camp and was about to swing</p><p>into the saddle and make a dash tor hi* own </p><p>detachment when, clear and distinct, his</p><p>ears caught the clang of a falling can; then a </p><p>second clang echoed in the silence; then a </p><p>third! A point of flame spat out into the </p><p>darkness and a gun-shot jarred the night. </p><p> “Halt! Who goes there?” came the quick</p><p>challenge of the sentry in the camp. </p><p> No time now to ponder over what lo do.</p><p>He pitched into his saddle and spurred into </p><p>a headlong gallop down the slope, regard- </p><p>less of the prairie-dog holes that yawned for </p><p>the leaping near-fore, and as his horse to-&gt;k </p><p>the slope he worked his revolver from the </p><p>holster. </p><p> He heard curses behind him thai were</p><p>followed by a shot and his campaign hat </p><p>jerked forward over his eyes and he was </p><p>suddenly aware of a sharp pain in his left </p><p>thigh as if a red-hot iron had been passed </p><p>across it. The next moment he had swung </p><p>his horse into the trail and thundered up </p><p>the far slope into his camp. </p><p> The men had got to their rifles and were</p><p>standing ready for the orders that came </p><p>quick and fast. </p><p> "Two of you take your horses—never</p><p>mind saddling and bridling them—and ride </p><p>The Salters </p><p>205 </p><p>hcll-for-leather to where this draw crosses </p><p>the line. Stop any one who attempts to </p><p>pass you. If they do not stop, shoot! </p><p> “Sergeant Wilson, take two more men</p><p>and get to the fence and reinforce the patrol </p><p>there. Shoot any one you see who will not </p><p>surrender. Mind you don’t shoot Dailey </p><p>or Boaz. York, you and Wentworth take </p><p>your lariats and stretch them along the gap </p><p>in the fence where the wires have been cut. </p><p>You can find the gaps by looking where </p><p>the cans are down. The rest of you come </p><p>with me!” </p><p> There were only two men left to follow</p><p>him and they did not follow very far, for as </p><p>soon as he reached the level ground in the </p><p>bottom of the draw, his left leg shut up </p><p>under him and he fell prostrate, gasping: </p><p> “Go on, men. There’re two men farther</p><p>on down the trail. Get them. Bring ’em in </p><p>or show me where they’re lyin\ Go on, you </p><p>fools. I'm hit.” </p><p> Two shots from the neighborhood of the</p><p>fence broke the silence, followed by the </p><p>thunder of several horses in a mad stam- </p><p>pede. The lone sentry in the camp fired </p><p>twice and then he heard the stinging crack </p><p>of a rifle tired down by the line. Again he </p><p>heard the whirling rush of galloping horses </p><p>till the very air seemed full of it. Then</p><p>came a long silence—he had fainted. </p><p> When he regained consciousness—and it</p><p>could not have been more than five minutes </p><p>later—he heard his men calling to cach </p><p>other from hilltop to hilltop. He rolled over </p><p>and working his revolver from the holster, </p><p>fired straight up in the air. Presently a </p><p>man broke from the bushes and ran down </p><p>to him as he lay in the low scrub. It was </p><p>Earle, one of his own men, who almost </p><p>stumbled over him. Passing his arm about </p><p>his wounded officer, he raised him bodily </p><p>from the ground. </p><p> “Hurt bad, sir?”</p><p> “I don’t know, Earle. Got a match?”</p><p> “Yes, sir.”</p><p> A hastily struck match showed a gaping</p><p>tear across the leg into which one could </p><p>have laid a finger. It was bleeding freely </p><p>and the khaki breeches were blood-soaked </p><p>almost as far as the knee. </p><p> “Only a flesh wound after all,” grunted</p><p>Needham. “I don’t see why 1 keeled over. </p><p>Give me your first-aid package, Earle." </p><p> The trooper tore it loose from his belt and</p><p>opening it, tied the bandage adroitly about </p><p>the wound, which was bad enough to have </p><p>bled much without being serious. With </p><p>the man’s aid, Needham got to his feet and </p><p>hobbled back to the camp, where he found </p><p>the men gathered by the replenished fire. </p><p>“Anything to report, Sergeant Wilson?” </p><p>“Yes, sir. I captured one man dowm by </p><p>the fence. Caught him in the act of cuttin’ </p><p>the wires. Lowe shot the pony of another </p><p>one. The rest of 'em got off, I reckon, sir. </p><p>They was tryin’ to do just what Mr. Dailey </p><p>said they would.” </p><p> “Did they succeed in running off any</p><p>stock?” </p><p> “Not a hair, sir!”</p><p>“Take a light and examine the dead pony </p><p>for his brand and bring the prisoner to me.” </p><p>Sergeant Wilson hastened oil to do his </p><p>bidding and presently a soldier stepping </p><p>forward into the ring of the firelight, said— </p><p>“Here’s the prisoner, sir!” </p><p> HE WAS a most villainous-looking</p><p>Mexican, black-bearded and dirty, </p><p>weighted down by three bandoliers </p><p>filled with cartridges, but he rolled his cigar- </p><p>ette with the insouciance that only a Mexi- </p><p>can or a Spaniard can affect, while Need- </p><p>ham, seated upon a saddle on the ground, </p><p>questioned him. </p><p> “No intende, sehor—I do not under-</p><p>stand—” however, being the only reply to </p><p>his questions, he very soon desisted.</p><p> “I’d make you understand if I had you</p><p>fer an hour in the bush,” growled the angry </p><p>sergeant. “There ain’t no better teacher of </p><p>English than a good revolver lanyard used </p><p>about a foot below* the shoulders. Sir,-" he </p><p>added, “I examined the pony that «as shot. </p><p>It is one of the Lazy B brand, but it's been </p><p>vented an’ there’s no new brand on him </p><p>that I can see.” </p><p> By which Sergeant Wilson meant that</p><p>the pony had originally been branded with </p><p>the letter B King down, but that some one </p><p>had crossed it out. </p><p> “An’ I can tell you about that,” said a</p><p>voice behind them. </p><p> Needham turned to find himself face to</p><p>face with Dailey. </p><p> “Hello, Dailey. Go ahead then. Tell me</p><p>what you can. L&gt;o you know the man?” </p><p>Dailey walked over to the man and </p><p>looked him over critically. </p><p> “Sure I know' him. His name’s Lopez.</p><p>He used to wTork fer us. / What'll you do </p><p>w ith him?” </p><p> “Turn him over to the sheriff, I suppose,</p><p>2 06 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>an' let the civil authorities prosecute him </p><p>for attempted horse-stealin’. Lord, but this </p><p>leg does hurt.” </p><p> Dailey started, . looked at Needham’s</p><p>white face and quickly pulling a flask from </p><p>his pocket, forced a drink down the young- </p><p>ster’s throat. </p><p> “You git on your back as quick as you</p><p>kin, Lieutenant, an' keep the blood outen </p><p>that leg. If you’ve got any report to make, </p><p>write it out an’ I’ll put it on the wire fer </p><p>you at Preciosa.” </p><p> Needham wrote a brief report of the</p><p>occurrence on a page from his notebook and </p><p>gave it to the stockman to be telegraphed </p><p>to the Post and, this done, bared his leg </p><p>and with Dailey’s assistance examined the </p><p>wound. The cow-puncher breathed a sigh </p><p>of relief. </p><p> “1 was afeared it was a high-power bullet.</p><p>You’ll be all right in a day or two. It’s </p><p>only a scratch. It ain’t touched bone ner </p><p>muscle. Now—” he gave a last touch to </p><p>the rough bandage—“you’re as good as </p><p>new. Keep out of the sun all you kin. Did </p><p>you tell ’em to send the doctor?” </p><p> “No. I didn’t tell them I’ve been hurt.</p><p>Don’t you say a word about it either, </p><p>Dailey. You see, I do not stand in very well </p><p>with the Old Man-” </p><p> “Who wants to?” growled Dailey. “A</p><p>man don’t pet ground-rattlers.” </p><p> “—And if he thought there was any</p><p>chance of there being any real work to do </p><p>down here that’d bring any credit to a man, </p><p>he’d relieve me and send one of his own </p><p>pets down here.” </p><p> “Johnson?” queried Dailey, who knew</p><p>both that officer and the Colonel. </p><p> “Veryr likely. Beside that, old man,</p><p>there’s another reason. There’s a girl at </p><p>the Post who would worry a lot if she knew </p><p>I’ve been hurt.” </p><p> “There most generally is a girl some-</p><p>where,” said Dailey, looking at him with </p><p>kindly eyes. </p><p> “So you see I only reported about the at-</p><p>tempt to steal the horses and the capture of </p><p>the thief and I will not ‘peep’ about the </p><p>row. See?” </p><p> “Aye, I see. I won’t open my head about</p><p>it to a soul, Lieutenant, but I want to say </p><p>right here an’ now that we owe you some- </p><p>thin’, me an’ Boaz, an’ we generally manage </p><p>to pay our debt. Your friend the Colonelll </p><p>swear to that before we’re through with him. </p><p>I ain’t a-goin’ to thank you. You done </p><p>your duty, an’ a feller don’t want thanks </p><p>fer doin’ that, but—well, maybe the day'll </p><p>come when J ’11 be able to show you that me </p><p>an’ Boaz ain’t the forgettin’ kind.” </p><p> He swung on his pony and cantered olf</p><p>down the trail toward Preciosa, leaving </p><p>Needham staring after him in the moonlight. </p><p>V </p><p>NEEDHAM’S telegram, discreetly </p><p>worded, created no disturbance at </p><p>the Post, but Colonel Borden, being </p><p>constitutionally unable to allow any one to </p><p>perform undisturbed the work to which he </p><p>had been assigned, telegraphed reams of in- </p><p>structions as to the manner in which the </p><p>prisoner should be turned over to tlie </p><p>sheriff. </p><p> It is doubtful if any prisoner being trans-</p><p>ferred to the military fortress of Peter and </p><p>Paul was ever surrounded by such formali- </p><p>ties. .All of which instructions having been </p><p>duly received were read by Needham with </p><p>an assiduity worthy of a better cause and </p><p>then were promptly cremated in the troop </p><p>lire. </p><p> No word having been received at the</p><p>Post of his wound, no one worried, lea?* of </p><p>all May Allardyce, who got her daily letter, </p><p>which was delivered by the orderly at the </p><p>house after her uncle had departed for the </p><p>office where he made the adjutant miser- </p><p>able for three hours ever)- morning. Each</p><p>time she received a letter, May went </p><p>through the regular formality of crossing </p><p>off the calendar one more day. The </p><p>eighteenth was marked with a huge red “M, </p><p>for that day was, if their plans did not mis- </p><p>carry, to be literally a red-letter day. </p><p> “I will not say a word to advise you,” she</p><p>wrote Needham, “but will leave the making </p><p>of the plans to you. It would seem ridicu- </p><p>lous if, being ready and willing to trust my </p><p>entire future life in your hands, I should </p><p>demur at any plans you make. Dedde on </p><p>what you think best to do and let me know </p><p>in time to make my arrangements.” </p><p> But Needham could do nothing until he</p><p>should get an answer to his night letter </p><p>to his uncle. Everytfiing hinged on that, </p><p>so, writing May to have patience, he told </p><p>her that he could not properly plan until be </p><p>could get a reply to his request lor the four </p><p>months’ leave. </p><p>It came one night when it was least ex- </p><p>pected, when a trooper, returning from </p><p>The Salters </p><p>207 </p><p>Preciosa late at night, rode up to his little </p><p>fire and handed Needham the brown en- </p><p>velope that meant so much to him. </p><p> “A telegram for the lieutenant, sir.”</p><p> Needham thanked him and tore it open.</p><p>A moment later the astonished men stared at </p><p>an apparently demented officer who danced </p><p>about the fire forgetful of his game leg. </p><p> “Good old Uncle Jim!” he muttered, un-</p><p>folding the telegram and reading it again </p><p>and again as if to convince himself that it </p><p>was true. </p><p>Lt. Gerald Needham, 16th Cav. </p><p> Preciosa, Arizona:</p><p> Four months leave granted you. Take effect</p><p>ISth inst. Copy of order mailed your Regimental </p><p>Commander today.	Needham.</p><p> “\Vhoo-oo—oop! Who's the man who</p><p>wants to do away with the United States </p><p>Senate. It’s the greatest body of law- </p><p>makers in the world. Oh, what a letter I'll </p><p>have to write to May tonight. She wanted </p><p>detailed plans— She’ll get ’em now—and </p><p>won’t the Old Man swear!” </p><p> He got out paper and pencil and wrote</p><p>feverishly: </p><p> A telegram that T have just received tells me that</p><p>my leave is granted, to begin on the eighteenth </p><p>—your birthday. OUR WEDDING-DAY! Now, </p><p>darling, listen very carefully, and I will tell you </p><p>what to do. On the eighteenth, you being twenty- </p><p>one years of age, will be no longer under your uncle’s </p><p>control in any way. Tf I return to the Post and we</p><p>arrange to marry there, it is quite within the realms </p><p>of possibility that the old devil would order me off </p><p>the Post and, it may be, you too. </p><p> Pack a suitcase and leave the Post unknown to</p><p>any one, on the mail-stage that leaves the Post- </p><p>Clfice at the Fort at eight-thirty the morning of </p><p>the eighteenth. It reaches Preciosa about noon </p><p>in time to put the mail-sacks on the noon train f-&gt;r </p><p>the East. The train docs not stop here. I will </p><p>meet you with a buckboard about two miles out on </p><p>the Post Road, and we will get on the noon train </p><p>for the East at Catlin’s Crossing, which is a flag </p><p>stop about three miles west of Preciosa. I will </p><p>write and get a license and have a minister on the </p><p>train and we will be married as soon as we get on </p><p>the car. Wc will send a telegram to your uncle </p><p>after it is all over, so that he can rejoice with u=. </p><p> Be very sure to do exactly as I tell you, because</p><p>the slightest change might spoil everything. All </p><p>you have to do is to pack your suitcase and start </p><p>for Preciosa on the stage on the morning of the </p><p>eighteenth. I will attend to everything else. </p><p>ALWAYS excepting a condemned </p><p>criminal awaiting the day set for </p><p>his execution, to no man does the </p><p>time pass so slowly as to the prospective </p><p>bridegroom. It was even worse than usual </p><p>to Needham, who knew nothing of either </p><p>state. Patrolling, always tiresome and </p><p>monotonous work, grew doubly so to him. </p><p>Even Dailey, who met him frequently now </p><p>on his rides, found him growing more and </p><p>more touchy. </p><p> “What ails you?” he asked, one day with</p><p>the direct frankness of the Southwest. </p><p>“Leg hurt you?” </p><p> Needham, who had for days longed for</p><p>some one to whom he could speak, threw </p><p>restraint to the winds. </p><p> “No. That isn’t it. I’m going to be mar-</p><p>ried, Dailev.” </p><p> “Does the girl know it?” asked the inter-</p><p>ested Mr. Dailey. </p><p> “She does. She is the niece of that old</p><p>devil up at the Fort-” </p><p> Dailey looked at him as one can imagine</p><p>the onlookers gazing at the leaders of a for- </p><p>lorn hope. </p><p> “Say, son, you’ve got the nerve! She</p><p>ain’t like him, I reckon-” </p><p> “Not much! I don’t know how he'll</p><p>take it. He’ll bust, I reckon. What’s the </p><p>matter with you?” he asked suspiciously, </p><p>for Mr. Dailey was rocking to and fro in his </p><p>saddle as if suddenly taken ill. </p><p> “Oh, nothin’! Nothin’! Only it's some-</p><p>thin’ I was thinkin’ about an’ this here </p><p>just about puts the gilded Mansard roof</p><p>on it. We was plannin’ a little party fer the </p><p>ol’ devil up there an' with this on top of </p><p>it-” </p><p> He rocked from side to side in renewed</p><p>laughter. </p><p> “The Old Man’s forbidden it.” said Need-</p><p>ham, “so we re goin’ to run away--” </p><p> “How? Where? Tell me all about it!”</p><p>Needham told him and Mr. Dailey </p><p>slapped his leg in unrestrained mirth. </p><p> “That’s all right, son! You’re on. an’</p><p>here’s where I kin help you. I ll go over to </p><p>the county seat tomorrow an’ get the license </p><p>fer you an’ arrange to have a minister on </p><p>the noon train the day after tomorrow. </p><p>You might have difficulty doin’ that, on </p><p>account of you not knowin’ nobody, but </p><p>I’ll go over tomorrow an’ attend to it ail fer </p><p>you. Give me the name of the lady.” </p><p>Needham wrote it out upon a piece of </p><p>paper and handed it to Dailey, who thrust </p><p>it into his pocket.	/ *</p><p> “I can count on you, can I, Dailey?*’</p><p>“San, you saved me an- Boaz a good manv </p><p>hundred dollar?. You sure could count on </p><p>it, just fer that; but you’re goin’ to salt Lhc </p><p>20 S </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Colonel. So am I. Only in another kind o’ </p><p>way. He'll git his—an' git it good! I'll </p><p>leave on the mornin’ train an* by tomorrow </p><p>night you’ll have your license in your pocket, </p><p>an’ the day after tomorrow at this time </p><p>you’ll be makin’ a noise like a bridigrooni!” </p><p>“Don’t say anytlung about it, will you, </p><p>Dailey?” </p><p> “Who? Me? O’ course not. Only to</p><p>Boaz an’ to old John Wilkes. He’s in the </p><p>game with me an’ Boaz. I’ll tell you about </p><p>it some time. You see, sou, it’ll be such a </p><p>blamed good joke on the old Colonel-” </p><p> “Joke on the Colonel? Colonel Borden?”</p><p> Mr Dailey nodded his head.</p><p> “You know he’s about as popular about</p><p>here as a skunk is at a church social—never </p><p>mind that! He called me ‘my man’ once, </p><p>before a gang of politicians, an’ they call me </p><p>that all over the state now—I’ll show him! </p><p>Got any money, Needham?” </p><p> Needham, about to take offense at the</p><p>words, caught the tone and smiled. </p><p> “Oh, I guess I’ve got enough. Much</p><p>obliged just the same.” </p><p> “I don’t mean that. I mean that me an’</p><p>Boas has got what we think is a good thing </p><p>—in copper it is. It ain’t any prospect </p><p>where you pay a man fer diggin’ a hole an’ </p><p>then keep on payin’ him as long as he digs.</p><p>You’d better pay a prairie dog than do that. </p><p>No, sir! If you’ve got, say, three hundred </p><p>dollars-” </p><p> “Yes, I’ve got that much.”</p><p> “Well, I’ll see Boaz tomorrow or the next</p><p>day an’ find out what he knows. He’s </p><p>lookin’ it up now. He went up to Pestilente </p><p>today to look the thing up. We got a </p><p>pointer that the people that owns the Kin- </p><p>caid Mine is about to beat down the stock </p><p>to low-water mark sol hey kin buy it all in </p><p>fer themselves an’ then cut a water-melon </p><p>in dividends. If there’s anything in it, </p><p>we’ll let you in on the ground floor. I’ll go </p><p>tomorrow an’ git that license fer you an’ </p><p>the sky-pilot’11 be on the job on the noon </p><p>train the day after tomorrow. Adios.” </p><p> He swung off down the trail and Need-</p><p>ham, glad at heart now that he had taken </p><p>the cow-puncher into his confidence, rode </p><p>back to his camp. </p><p>THAT afternoon, Johnson coming </p><p>down to relieve Needham from the </p><p>command of the little detachment, </p><p>Needham turned over to him the various </p><p>orders that he had received from time to </p><p>time and gave him what information he </p><p>could. Johnson, however, was not very </p><p>receptive. He knew loo much. </p><p> “Dailey and Boaz’ll heJp you all they</p><p>can," said Needham. </p><p> “Ah, indeed.” Mr. Johnson smiled bis</p><p>superiority. “So you’ve been consorting </p><p>with that crowd? The Colonel said he </p><p>thought you would. Why, Needham, </p><p>they’re the worst outfit of robbers this </p><p>country has ever seen. I can't see what you </p><p>see in them. Coarse, common, vulgar cow- </p><p>punchers! Colonel Borden says-” </p><p> “Oh,- what Colonel Borden says and</p><p>you too. The one redeeming feature about </p><p>this place is that you don’t have t-- listen </p><p>to him. If you’re here for a month, Johnson, </p><p>you'll have good chance to rest up and get </p><p>the taste of shoe-polish out of your mouth.” </p><p>Whereat Mr. Johnson had the grace to </p><p>lose his temper. </p><p> Colonel Borden, however, was not so well</p><p>satisfied as he might have been. Such an </p><p>important thing as transferring the com- </p><p>mand of a detachment of ten men from one </p><p>officer to another without his being present </p><p>to interfere w’as of doubtful propriety. Be- </p><p>side that, there was just one chance in a </p><p>thousand that, by dropping in on them </p><p>unexpectedly, he might briDg to light some </p><p>dereliction of duty on the part of Air. Need- </p><p>ham that would justify him in refusing to</p><p>permit him to take advantage of his leave </p><p>of absence which had been granted him </p><p>over the head of his Colonel. Accordingly, </p><p>he dropped a bomb in the midst of the </p><p>dinner-table as they sat at dinner on the </p><p>night of the seventeenth, when be remarked </p><p>sourly— </p><p> “Molly, I'll have to have my breakfast at</p><p>half-past three in the morning.” </p><p> “Well, all I have to say is that you'll</p><p>probably have trouble in getting it. ou </p><p>know very well that the cook does not get </p><p>here till six—” and so forth con amore. </p><p>Even' married man knows it. </p><p> “Can 1 or can 1 not have what I want</p><p>and pay for in my own house?" thundered </p><p>the Colonel. “If you were to spend half </p><p>as much time in attending to your duties </p><p>as you spend in telling me how to run this </p><p>Post-” </p><p> “If I didn’t run this house any better</p><p>than you run this Post-” </p><p> May rose and pushing her chair back</p><p>from the table left the room. Her uncle </p><p>gazed after her triumphantly. If he </p><p>The Salters </p><p>209 </p><p>thought for one moment, which he did, </p><p>rejoicing thereat mightily, that she had </p><p>gone to her room to cry, he was vastly mis- </p><p>taken. She had gone to her room to pack </p><p>her suitcase and to put it where no prying </p><p>eye should find it. As she went up the steps </p><p>she could not help hearing her uncle’s last </p><p>words. He had testily opened the mail </p><p>that the orderly had brought him. A long, </p><p>stiff official envelope attracted his attention </p><p>and eying it eagerly he ripped it open with </p><p>liis dessert-knife. Two long blue checks, </p><p>each for two hundred dollars, fell out. He </p><p>picked them up eagerly and then burst </p><p>forth: </p><p> “See what it is to be a fool! I sent my</p><p>pay accounts to the paymaster two weeks </p><p>ago and requested him to send me four hun- </p><p>dred dollars in small checks so that we could </p><p>have them cashed here as we needed them. </p><p>No human being nearer than John Wilkes </p><p>at Preciosa can cash these checks. I had </p><p>intended to go there in the morning, any- </p><p>way, and now this makes it imperative. </p><p>We’ve got to have some cash. I’ve got to </p><p>go early in the morning. I want to get there </p><p>so that I can get out to the camp before </p><p>Mr. Needham has a chance to leave. If he </p><p>has not fully complied with all the regula- </p><p>tions, by the eternal, he shall not go on his </p><p>leave! I’ll stop it!”</p><p> "How did he succeed in getting his leave</p><p>when you had disapproved it?” </p><p> “How? By going over my head officially</p><p>and by invoking some sort of cheap political </p><p>aid. When he gets back to this regiment, </p><p>I’ll see that he gets a course of training!” </p><p> “I suppose his uncle helped him. You</p><p>know he has an uncle who is a United </p><p>States Senator. What a pity it is, Colonel, </p><p>that Mr. Needham is so deep in your black </p><p>bocks. If you had only liked him, it is quite </p><p>within the realms of possibilities that you </p><p>might have got—oh, well, I do not suppose </p><p>you will ever be a Brigadier-General if no </p><p>one ever has a chance to know your abilities </p><p>—if a Colonel today wishes to retire-” </p><p> “An uncle — a senator? Why—why,</p><p>madam!" said the Colonel with the most </p><p>elaborate politeness that finally gave way </p><p>under the strain, just as a dam gives way </p><p>under pressure. “Why in -, madam, </p><p>have you kept this from me?” </p><p> “I supposed of course you knew it and</p><p>that you—would not allow yourself to be </p><p>swerved by personal feelings where your </p><p>principles were involved. I knew that </p><p> 14</p><p>under no circumstances would you allow </p><p>him to use political aid to help you- </p><p> May heard just this much in her aunt's</p><p>voice before she fled to her own room, where </p><p>she buried her face in her pillows to deaden </p><p>the shrieks of her laughter, which she feared </p><p>would be heard below stairs. It was simply </p><p>delicious beyond the power of words to de- </p><p>scribe. How Gerald, her husband tomor- </p><p>row, would enjoy it. She blushed at the </p><p>thought and then came the knowledge that </p><p>there still remained a way by which she </p><p>could re-establish friendly relations with </p><p>her uncle should she ever desire to do so. </p><p>The very knowledge, too, that she could do </p><p>so, hurt her. for it was not pleasant to see </p><p>such veniality even in a man for whom she </p><p>had long since lost all regard. </p><p> She finished packing her suitcase, un-</p><p>dressed, brushed her hair and. after writing </p><p>a farewell note to her aunt, crept into her </p><p>bed, where she dropped oil to sleep, smiling </p><p>happily. </p><p>fffiS COLONEL BORDEN, for his part, </p><p>gSgSg spent a very pleasant evening in </p><p>making his wife as thoroughly miser- </p><p>able as only a man of his type can. Finally </p><p>announcing his intention to leave the Post </p><p>at half-past three, he went off to bed, leav- </p><p>ing his wife in tears. </p><p> Promptly at three-thirty, appearing on</p><p>the scene with a bad temper and an attack </p><p>of indigestion and finding no breakfast, he </p><p>stormed out upon the porch and threw him- </p><p>self into the waiting buckboard, paying no </p><p>attention to the shrieked: “Oh, Colonel! </p><p>Colonel! Wait a moment! I ll come down </p><p>and get you a cup of coffee!" that floated </p><p>down to him from the second story. Like </p><p>most men in like case, he imagined that </p><p>somehow he was inflicting an injury upon </p><p>his wife by going away without his break- </p><p>fast. </p><p> “I’ll get some breakfast at old John</p><p>Wilkes’s place. I’ve got to get him to cash </p><p>my checks, anyway. 1 suppose he’s got four </p><p>hundred dollars in his place. Big fool as he </p><p>is, he ought to be able to cook a simple </p><p>breakfast for me. I hope I catch that young </p><p>scoundrel Needham in some dereliction of </p><p>duty. I’d just like to show him what it </p><p>means to go over my head in official mat- </p><p>ters.” </p><p> With which charitable wish Colonel Bor-</p><p>den solaced himself for several miles until </p><p>it occurred to him that he was missing a </p><p>210 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>chance to swear at the driver lor his bad </p><p>driving. Accordingly, he devoted himself </p><p>to scathing comments on that functionary </p><p>till he saw him growing \ isibiy red behind </p><p>the ears. </p><p> The morning was fresh and the road was</p><p>good, if dusty, so that in three hours he </p><p>found himself in sight of the little brown </p><p>settlement of Preciosa. </p><p> "Go to John Wilkes’s house, driver. I</p><p>want to get some breakfast.” </p><p> Now John Wilkes’s house had four rooms.</p><p>One was a general store, one was a bar- </p><p>room, one was called by courtesy an “eating- </p><p>room,” and the fourth was Mr. Wilkes’s own </p><p>private boudoir. The kitchen was a small </p><p>adobe building detached from the house. </p><p>Mr. Wilkes stood in the doorway of the </p><p>store listening vaguely to a conversation </p><p>between Messieurs Dailey and Boaz, who </p><p>were in the bar, which connected by a door </p><p>generally kept closed with the cating-room. </p><p> “It's all done,'* said Boaz proudly. “I</p><p>done it myself. I couldn’t trust no one </p><p>else. I took the ol’ shotgun an’ I loaded </p><p>her up with about ten dollars per barrel. </p><p>Man! It’s a shame to take the money! I </p><p>acted on the hint that old John gave me—” </p><p>“What hint's that?” </p><p> “Why, he told me that I’d better spread</p><p>some sackin’ in front of the rock so’s to</p><p>catch the fumes of the powder when I shot </p><p>through it. You see if the assayer was to </p><p>find sulfur in his] assay, he'd git suspi- </p><p>cious.” ^ </p><p> Mr. Dailey gazed long and admiringly at</p><p>Mr. Wilkes’s back. </p><p> “Now who would have thought of that</p><p>but old John?” he demanded. “A good </p><p>pirate was lost in John. How much ore is </p><p>there on that dump, Mike?” </p><p> “Welt sir, I fired about ten shots, I think,</p><p>at the dump itself. If 1 lifted one pound of </p><p>rock there, I lifted five hundred. I didn’t </p><p>put it all in one shot. I scattered it. Didn’t </p><p>you hear the shoot in’?” </p><p> “Sure I did, but 1 thought you was</p><p>shootin’ at quail.' </p><p> “Quail nothin’. 1 lifted all the top rock</p><p>off so I could get at the bottom layers an’ </p><p>I put the same stones back where they come </p><p>from so that the moss was slill on top. </p><p>Every time I placed a new layer, I plugged </p><p>it with a shot an’ then I mixed in a lot of old </p><p>lookin’ shale with the pile so it would look </p><p>like it had never been bothered none.” </p><p> The slurring of buckboard wheels in the</p><p>foot-deep dust of the roadway drew both </p><p>men to the door. Colonel Borden dis- </p><p>mounted, waving to Mr. Wilkes in the door- </p><p>way. </p><p>FOR the edification of th&lt; &gt;se who do </p><p>not know what ‘salting” is as prac- </p><p>tised in the busy marts of the West, </p><p>it may be explained that Mr. Boaz had been </p><p>employed that morning in preparing a gold- </p><p>mine for sale by the simple method of </p><p>“salting” it. </p><p> Now there are two methods of salting a</p><p>mine. If it is a placer mine, which is a mine </p><p>in or near a water-course, where the gold- </p><p>bearing gravel is simply washed out in the </p><p>water, salting consists in simply scattering </p><p>some gold-dust and then allowing the vic- </p><p>tim to dig it out and pan it. </p><p> The method of salting a quartz mine is</p><p>diilerent, requiring at times an e.'rpert. In </p><p>salting a quartz mine, the gold must be </p><p>made to adhere to the quartz in the dig- </p><p>gings and in the loose rock on the core- </p><p>dump. This is done by the simple means </p><p>of loading the gold-dust into a shotgc . </p><p>and shooting it up against the rock. It </p><p>must be done from the right distance and </p><p>in just the right quantity. Too little </p><p>would not induce one to buy; too much </p><p>would make the would-be purchaser suspi- </p><p>cious. Care must also be taken that the </p><p>gold is the same quality tliat comes from</p><p>that district. This was the work on which </p><p>Mr. Boaz had been employed that morning. </p><p> “Let’s get our business done Urn of all,</p><p>Mr. Wilkes. I will appreciate it if you </p><p>can do me a favor—ah! I knew you would </p><p>if you could. Yes—I'm in a—ah—ah, a sort </p><p>of an embarrassing situation. I sent my </p><p>pay accounts to the paymaster with the re- </p><p>quest tliat he send me a lot of small checks </p><p>so that I could use them to pay bills with. </p><p>He paid no attention to my request, but. like </p><p>the fool he is, sent me two checks for two </p><p>hundred dollars each. Can you cash them </p><p>for me, Mr. Wilkes?” </p><p> Mr. Wilkes went to the little iron safe</p><p>that stood in the corner and after pawing </p><p>the combination for five minutes got the </p><p>door open and announced that he could sup- </p><p>ply cash for the checks. He proceeded to </p><p>count out the cash in dirty, greasy bills by </p><p>the aid of sundry lickings of the tongue, </p><p>more or less audible. </p><p> “Now for breakfast. Eggs, Mr. Wilkes,</p><p>if you’ve got any fresh.* And some nice </p><p>The Salters </p><p>211 </p><p>crisp toast and a cup of coffee with a </p><p>few slices of well-browned bacon. I like a </p><p>simple breakfast. Please hurry, my man.” </p><p>“Holy cats! I wonder what he eats w'hen </p><p>he’s hungry. Look at John! He’s a-havin’ </p><p>a fit.” </p><p> Mr. Wilkes w-as struggling manfully</p><p>against evident resentment. </p><p> “I kin give you coffee,” he said slowly,</p><p>“an* bread, but I ain’t saw a egg since </p><p>Easter. I ain’t got no bacon, but I can give </p><p>you corned beef.” </p><p> “Call this a hotel?” snapped the Colonel.</p><p>“I ain’t called it nothin’,” barked back </p><p>Mr. Wilkes fiercely. “An’ I’d advise you not </p><p>to neither. I ain’t no soldier. You cain’t </p><p>talk loose to me, ’cause I won’t take it an’ </p><p>you ain’t wuth it. If you want what I got, </p><p>you kin buy it. If you don’t like it, you kin </p><p>go hungry.” </p><p> “Well—well, my man-”</p><p> “An’ I ain’t your man neither, ner no-</p><p>body else’s man but John Wilkes’,” </p><p>snapped the old man angry now' in earnest. </p><p> “I didn’t mean any offense—you know</p><p>how a hungry man feels, Mr. Wilkes,” said </p><p>the Colonel, who saw the chance of a break- </p><p>fast rapidly disappearing. “Give me what </p><p>you can, and for Heaven’s sake, hurry it up, </p><p>will you, Mr. Wilkes?” </p><p> “No, and I won’t hurry it up none neither.</p><p>I’ll take my own time to it an’ them as</p><p>don’t like it kin go further,” grumbled Mr. </p><p>Wilkes, retreating into the kitchen, where </p><p>his voice could be heard as he talked </p><p>querulously to himself. </p><p> “Oh, Mr. Wilkes!” The Colonel’s voice,</p><p>too, had growTn snappy and irritated. </p><p>“There’s some one in the bar, I think. See </p><p>w'ho it is, please. It may be some one to see </p><p>me. Who is in there?” </p><p> His quick ear had caught the sound of</p><p>moving feet as the two men in the barroom </p><p>shifted their positions. </p><p> “Say somethin’,” growled Boaz. “Say</p><p>somethin’, an’ say it quick, to make him </p><p>think we didn’t know he wras in there.” </p><p>VI </p><p>THE door between the rooms w*as </p><p>closed and Colonel Borden had no </p><p>more idea than any person has of </p><p>the carrying properties of his own voice. </p><p>The fact that he heard the voices of the men </p><p>in the next room should have lold him that </p><p>his own was audible. </p><p> “An’ I says to him—” the voice carried</p><p>well through the closed door—“ ‘I can’t tell </p><p>you nothin’,’ I says, ‘till I see Boaz.’ You </p><p>remember that you was away. ‘I wrant to </p><p>let you in on the ground floor,’ I says, ‘be- </p><p>cause you helped us save them cattle that </p><p>the greasers w’as tryin’ to run off.’ Well, </p><p>when I said that, Needham he up an’ says: </p><p>“ ‘How much will it cost me to come in on </p><p>tliis ground floor along with you an’ Boaz? </p><p>I ain’t got much ready cash,’ he says, </p><p>‘but I kin put up a matter of three or four </p><p>hundred dollars. It’s mighty good of you, </p><p>Dailey,’ he says again, ‘an’ I only wish I had </p><p>more money to put in it.’ </p><p> “Of course I told him that w*e was anxious</p><p>to git the cash in right away so we kin buy </p><p>the claim up at once. He listened to me </p><p>right good an’ then he says that when he </p><p>comes back from leave he’ll be married then, </p><p>an’ he’ll have a lot o’ money to invest. It </p><p>sure is funny, Mike, to listen to these yere </p><p>people who gets married believin' that two </p><p>can live as cheap as one. Marryin' on the </p><p>pay of a lieutenant he w'on't never have </p><p>two quarters to jingle on a tombstone." </p><p> A long silence reigned in the eating-room.</p><p>If the Colonel could have looked through the </p><p>closed door he might have seen Mr. Dailey </p><p>leaning over the bar. his left eye contem- </p><p>platively closed as he w atched his partner, </p><p>who was grinning foolishly. Presently, </p><p>Dailey, hearing Colonel Borden’s chair </p><p>scrape across the rough floor, began in a </p><p>slightly higher key:</p><p> “O’ course, Mike, just between us, it is a</p><p>good thing. It’s the best thing that I’ve </p><p>seen in twenty years out here in Arizona- </p><p>Old Wilkes himself don't know* how good </p><p>it is. If he had any notion of it, he’d never </p><p>have been willin’ to sell fer nine hundred. </p><p>He's so darned lazy that he ain’t been near </p><p>the claim fer a month, an’ durin’ all that </p><p>time, the greaser that he hired to work the </p><p>claim fer him has been haulin’ the ore </p><p>away an’ selLin’ it. If old John knowed </p><p>what that ore-dump shows right now he’d </p><p>have heart failure. To tell you the truth, </p><p>I ain’t so blamed anxious to let young Need- </p><p>ham in on this. Of course we owe him some- </p><p>thin’ fer havin’ helped us out with them </p><p>raiders, but I’d a heap ruthcr have a re- </p><p>sponsible man in with us on this. It’s most </p><p>too big a thing to fool with. When we’re </p><p>done wTe ought to clean up fifteen thousand </p><p>dollars easy.” </p><p> “But you told Needham you’d let him in</p><p>21 2 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>on this here thing,” said Boaz oomplain- </p><p>ingly. </p><p> “So 1 did, but he says right out that he</p><p>can’t very well spare the cash right now. </p><p>He wants us to hold oil iVr four months. </p><p>We can’t do that. Why, old johu is likely </p><p>to Lind out about this at any moment an’ </p><p>when he does it's good-by to any chance of </p><p>gettin' any gold otfen that claim.” </p><p> The chair in the next room scraped back</p><p>still further and they heard the Colonel rise </p><p>and come to the door. Mr. Dailey snick- </p><p>ered openly, </p><p> “Gentlemen—” The Colonel opened the</p><p>door and walked in— “1 hope you will </p><p>pardon me. I could not help hearing a </p><p>part of your conversation. Ah, Mr. Dailey, </p><p>bow do you do? Well, I hope. And this is </p><p>Mr. Boaz too—I am very glad indeed to see </p><p>you, gentlemen.” </p><p> To save his life the Colonel could not keep</p><p>the patronizing note out of his voice. </p><p> “I understand, gentlemen, that my</p><p>young officer, Mr. Needham, has been so </p><p>fortunate as to have been of some assistance </p><p>to you in saving your stock. That’s what </p><p>we’re here for, gentlemen, you know. To </p><p>help you gentlemen all we can. Our army </p><p>is a public tool, you know, always to be used </p><p>to help the people.” </p><p> Mr. Dailey and Mr. Boaz shuffled their</p><p>feet embarassedly along the floor. Had </p><p>Colonel Borden been looking, indeed, he </p><p>might have seen Mr. Dailey’s left eyelid</p><p>flutter a moment and lie still. He had </p><p>heard the Colonel before on the propriety </p><p>of having the Post garrison split up to </p><p>guard the border. </p><p> “Mr. Needham is one of my best young</p><p>officers,” went on the Colonel. “I did not </p><p>mean to play the eavesdropper, but—er— </p><p>er—I could not help overhearing a part of </p><p>your talk. It is very good of you two gen- </p><p>tlemen to plan to help the young man </p><p>financially. I suppose he needs it. Most </p><p>young men do. He is to go away today on </p><p>leave of absence for four months. Quite a </p><p>long leave, and I—ah—may say that it took </p><p>a deal of work on my part to get it for him. </p><p> “Indeed, 1 can hardly spare him as it is.</p><p>But 1 am delaying you, gentlemen. What </p><p>I wanted to say is this: From what part of </p><p>your talk I could not well help overhearing </p><p>I understand that it is your intention to let </p><p>Mr. Needham in on what you call a good </p><p>thing financially,but that he has not got the </p><p>ready money to invest at present. On the </p><p>ground floor, so to speak, to use	of</p><p>those incomparably humorous idioms of the </p><p>Southwest." </p><p> He winked ponderously, intending Mes-</p><p>sieurs Dailey and Boaz to appreciate his </p><p>quickness of perception as well as his busi- </p><p>ness acumen. </p><p> “Of course Mr. Needham hasn’t got the</p><p>money. Youngsters rarely have. Now if </p><p>you gentlemen really wish to do him a good </p><p>turn, if you will show me that this project </p><p>is really a good thing, I can in pul the three </p><p>hundred dollars that you need and when Lhe </p><p>time comes, transfer the claim or whatever </p><p>it is to Mr. Needham when he is in a posi- </p><p>tion to take it.” </p><p> “That’s square of you, Colonel. Mighty</p><p>square, sir!” Dailey’s voice boomed big </p><p>with appreciation. “But it’s so small a </p><p>tiling that it wouldn’t be even interestin’ to </p><p>a gentleman of your means. You wouldn’t </p><p>want to touch it.” </p><p> To Colonel Borden, strong in the knowl-</p><p>edge that on the very day his guardianship </p><p>of his pretty niece’s fortune ceased and th.it </p><p>legally the management of her fortune h i </p><p>already passed out of his hands, the fifteen </p><p>thousand dollars that he had heard men- </p><p>tioned a short time before, did not sound </p><p>small. All numbers are purely relative. </p><p> “Not for myself. No. You are right, of</p><p>course. Personally I should not think of </p><p>making a small investment like this. I </p><p>merely mention it because I thought per- </p><p>haps you might like me to take the matter</p><p>up for Mr. Needham. It is of no conse- </p><p>quence.” </p><p> “Oh, I see.” Mr. Dailey became sud-</p><p>denly convinced. “If we show you the </p><p>place an’ you decide that it’s a good thing </p><p>an’ decide to go in fer Needham, then you'll </p><p>transfer it to him if he wants it?” </p><p> “Certainly. That’s the understanding?"</p><p> “It ain't hardly necessary to put that in</p><p>writing I suppose. With most people it </p><p>would be, but of course no army officer </p><p>would sting another.” </p><p> “Sir?” The Colonel looked properly in-</p><p>dignant. </p><p> “Oh, pshaw. Colonel, Dailey didn’t mean</p><p>nothin’! Here’s what we’ve got," broke in </p><p>Boaz. </p><p> He glanced around the room furtively a&gt;</p><p>he spoke. </p><p> “It ain’t necessary fer old John to hear u&gt;</p><p>talkin’. If he knowed what we know, he </p><p>wouldn't sell that claim o' liisn at any price- </p><p>The Salters </p><p>213 </p><p>Come on outside, Colonel, where nobody can </p><p>hear us.” </p><p>THEY passed outside the door. </p><p>Once arrived at the back of the </p><p>house, Mr. Dailey produced some </p><p>samples of ore from a capacious pocket and </p><p>passed them to the Colonel. </p><p> “Old John took up a claim seven years</p><p>ago, away up the canon here. Up by Willow </p><p>Water it is. You know it. It’s about three </p><p>miles up the creek. Well, you know he’s </p><p>gettin’ old an’ he’s gettin’ lazy, an’ instead </p><p>of doin’ his own work on the claim he’s been </p><p>hirin’ a greaser to work it fer him. At </p><p>first it didn’t pay. He was workin’ it fer </p><p>near six years before he got color enough to </p><p>make him keep on. </p><p> “Then it pinched out on him, but he</p><p>wouldn’t quit. Every cent that he makes </p><p>offen the store he’s been payin’ that greaser </p><p>to work the claim fer him. About a month </p><p>ago we began to have suspicions that all </p><p>wasn’t right. We got on the trail of that </p><p>greaser an’ found he was gettin’ drunk </p><p>every Saturday night in Nogales an’ then </p><p>we trailed him home an’ discovered that he </p><p>was haulin’ the ore away from the dump on </p><p>the claim by the burro load an’ was sellin’ </p><p>it right in Nogales fer eight dollars a load. </p><p>You kin figure out how much the ore was </p><p>runnin’ to the ton.” </p><p> Dailey, who had begun to believe his</p><p>own story, was obviously excited and Boaz </p><p>was puffing at liis cheap cigar till it threat-</p><p>ened to burst into a blaze. </p><p> “Well, sir, as I say, we trailed him an*</p><p>found out what he was doin’. All that ore </p><p>come from John Wilkes’s ore-dump, an’ old </p><p>John never knowed it. It ain’t no sin to </p><p>keep quiet somethin’. Beside that that old </p><p>deviJ stuck me bad on a horse last year. </p><p>He’d eat loco-weed an’ he like to killed me. </p><p> “It turned out that he hadn’t been near</p><p>the claim fer a year to my certain knowledge </p><p>so when we offered to buy the claim he </p><p>jumped at the chance. He wanted nine </p><p>hundred. He asked three thousand at first </p><p>but we let him beat hisself down to nine </p><p>hundred. I’ve got here three hundred of </p><p>mine an’ three hundred of Boaz’s an’ we </p><p>was lookin’ fer Needham to put in his so </p><p>we can close up the bargain. We was </p><p>anxious to close up the tiling on account of </p><p>Worth down in Nogales gettin’ on to the </p><p>thing in-* kind of a way. If you want to </p><p>come in, sir, you kin, but it’s on the under- </p><p>standin’ that you’re doin’ it fer Needham. </p><p>It'll cost you three hundred dollars cash </p><p>down.” </p><p> “Can I see the claim and the ore-dump?-’</p><p>asked Colonel Borden quietly. Underneath </p><p>that tone he was fairly quivering with ex- </p><p>citement. He had known several officers in </p><p>times past who had been let in on the </p><p>ground floors of good things realize largely </p><p>from the investments that had been made </p><p>on just such pointers given by these ster- </p><p>ling, rough pioneers. Whatever he might </p><p>make, it was not a matter of doubt in his </p><p>own mind that Mr. Needham would not be </p><p>entitled to any of it. He would be investing </p><p>his own money, not that of Needham. </p><p> “Of course you can see the thing. We</p><p>don’t want you to buy a pig in a poke. Got </p><p>an hour or two to spare?” </p><p> The Colonel consulted his watch.</p><p> “I am in your hands, gentlemen, until</p><p>eleven o'clock.'' </p><p> “Come on then. If you an’ Boaz’ll walk</p><p>on up the trail fer a bit, 1 11 sneak around to </p><p>the stables an’ git my buckboard without </p><p>lettin’ old John see us. We kin drive up </p><p>there in a half-hour. I'll just take a look to </p><p>see that oF John don't suspicion nothin'. </p><p>Ready, sir?" </p><p> “My breakfast,” gasped the Colonel.</p><p> He strode back into the eating-room,</p><p>where he found Mr. Wilkes slapping down </p><p>sundry evil-looking dishes upon a none </p><p>too clean table. </p><p> “It’s ready! Come an’ git it,” was his an-</p><p>nouncement. made sourly.</p><p> The Colonel sat down and fairly gobbled</p><p>at the most unappetizing meal that he had </p><p>ever tried to eat. Mr. Wilkes had excelled </p><p>himself. </p><p>TEN minutes Jater the Colonel </p><p>joined Mr. Boaz in front of the </p><p>house and they walked slowly down </p><p>the trail, carefully observed by Mr. Wilkes, </p><p>who, standing with a curtain grasped in </p><p>each hand, fairly shook with Homeric </p><p>laughter. </p><p> A heavy-handed slap upon the shoulder</p><p>nearly threw him off his feet, end he turned </p><p>to face Dailey. </p><p> “Now, John, get a move on you.” he said</p><p>quickly. “Get that muzzle-loadin” shotgun </p><p>of yourn an' load it up with black powder </p><p>an* this-” </p><p> He handed him a small glass bottle that</p><p>was half filled with gold-dust and gravel. </p><p>2-14 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Boaz has salted the dump, but he told</p><p>me that he clean forgot to salt the vein in- </p><p>side the shaft. If the old man examines the </p><p>dump an' sees gold an' then looks at the </p><p>veins Inside in the shaft entrance an’ don’t </p><p>see no sign of gold, he'll call off an’ spot the </p><p>game. Slip up there just as quick an’ as </p><p>quiet as you kin and lire a shot at the </p><p>headin’. Everything is all fixed up there </p><p>for it. </p><p> “Boaz left his screen all fixed in front of</p><p>the tunnel just as it should be to fix the veins. </p><p>It’s made o’ old sugar sackin’, an’ all you’ve </p><p>got to do is to get up there right quick an’ </p><p>lire a shot tlirough the screen an’ then get </p><p>out as fast as you can. You’ll have to </p><p>hurry up, though. I’ll hold ’em back as </p><p>long as I can. After you’ve fired the shot, </p><p>sneak right up the hill as fast as you can an’ </p><p>then come down again an’ say you was after </p><p>quail. ' Use your pony. You’ll have no </p><p>time to get there walkin’." </p><p> Mr. Wilkes nodded comprehendingly,</p><p>took the shotgun from the corner, poured a </p><p>generous charge of black powder down each </p><p>yawning barrel, rammed a half a newspaper </p><p>in on top of each charge, decanted carefully </p><p>the gold-dust on top of that, rammed that </p><p>home with wet cotton atop and, hastily cap- </p><p>ping the piece, made for the back door. </p><p> “Man, but I’m workin’ hard these days,”</p><p>he said complainingly. “I ain’t doin’ it fer </p><p>money, mind,’’ he called back over his </p><p>shoulder. “You didn’t hear what he called </p><p>my hotel today, did you?” </p><p> “Nobody's doin’ it fer money,” said</p><p>Dailey scornfully. “Who’d salt a mine fer </p><p>three hundred dollars. I’m doin’ it to fix </p><p>him. He’s so derned high an' mighty with </p><p>his know-it-all airs, callin’ his betters ‘my </p><p>man.’ After you sting him good once he'll </p><p>quit talkin' about knowin’ so much about </p><p>mines. He’ll move East, I’m thinkin’, after </p><p>this. When it 's all done we’ll have to make </p><p>a big fuss about it somehow or other an’ then </p><p>give him back his coin, after he’s made a </p><p>fool of hissclf. Hurry up, John! 1 can’t </p><p>wait no longer. You'll have to crowd your </p><p>hoss, as it is, to get there.” </p><p> He stood for a moment watching Mr.</p><p>Wilkes scrambling up the loose shale of the </p><p>hillside as fast as his old legs could carry </p><p>him on his way to liis stable, and then, </p><p>climbing into liis dingy rattle-trap of a </p><p>buckboard, Dailey drove slowly up the trail </p><p>to where Colonel Borden and Mr. Boaz </p><p>stood awaiting him. </p><p> st</p><p> “It ain’t very far,” he said as they</p><p>arted oft, "so we can take our time." </p><p>“I have not much time to spare," said the </p><p>Colonel presently. “I have to go over to </p><p>inspect Mr. Needham’s camp before noon. </p><p>Let your horses out, Mr. Dailey.” </p><p> Under his Cunstant urging, Dailey let the</p><p>eager ponies so faster than he intended. </p><p>He could not refuse point-blank to hasten, </p><p>but he made ever)' possible effort to delay </p><p>progress in order to give Mr. Wilkes all the </p><p>time he could. First he dropped his whip. </p><p>Then, that proving unavailing, he adroitly </p><p>kicked into the dusty trail the desert </p><p>water-bag, without which no man travels </p><p>in the Southwest. No sound of any shot </p><p>coming to his listening ears, he became </p><p>despondent. Finally Colonel Borden, un- </p><p>able to restrain himself longer, laid a heavy- </p><p>hand upon the reins. </p><p> “Oh, go on, Dailey! You drive like an</p><p>apple-woman. Let the ponies go. We’ll </p><p>never get there.” </p><p> “We’re there now,” said Boaz, as a jerk</p><p>of the buckboard nearly threw him out ■ f </p><p>the wagon. “There’s the entry.” </p><p> He pointed to a yawning, black mouth</p><p>that gaped at them from the hillside three </p><p>hundred feet up in air. A great pile of ore </p><p>lay on the dump just outside the mouth of </p><p>the tunnel and, in front of the entrance, ex- </p><p>actly as a shade stands before a fireplace, </p><p>he noticed with concern a great screen made </p><p>of old sugar sacking. It was about four </p><p>feet square and nearly obscured the mouth </p><p>of the entrance. It was through this very</p><p>screen that he had salted the ore-dump </p><p>itself earlier in the day. </p><p> “One moment, Colonel.” Dailey was</p><p>sparring for time, though be well knew that </p><p>time could not avail them now. “Fair </p><p>play’s a jewel. It’s only right for you to </p><p>deposit with us your three hundred dollars </p><p>before you go up there. You turn over your </p><p>money to me or Boaz an’ then we’ll take </p><p>you up to see that claim. If you like it, you </p><p>own one-third of it. If you don’t like it, </p><p>we'll turn the money straight back to y"u, </p><p>you givin’ us a promise in v. ritin" not to say </p><p>a word about the matter till we give you </p><p>leave. Ain’t that right, Mike?” </p><p> “Sounds all right. You see. Colonel, you</p><p>ain’t runnin’ no risk. If you like it, it s </p><p>yourn. It you don’t like it. it’s oum an we </p><p>have your promise not to tell anybody else </p><p>about it. We got to protect ourselves. </p><p>Shell out, sir!” </p><p>The Salters </p><p>215 </p><p> Colonel Borden glared at them, puffed</p><p>sterlorously for a moment and, finally pro- </p><p>ducing a plethoric pocket-book, counted out </p><p>the money with a hand that trembled with </p><p>eagerness. </p><p> “Now we’ll go up there,” said Dailey,</p><p>springing out of the buckboard. </p><p> “One moment, gentlemen. By this last</p><p>act you have stripped this deal of any per- </p><p>sonal feelings that might have entered into </p><p>it and have made it simply a cold business </p><p>deal. I prefer to examine that claim by </p><p>myself, if you have no objection. If you </p><p>gentlemen will kindly await me here I will </p><p>run on up there. I flatter myself that it </p><p>will not take me long. I am a bit of a con- </p><p>noisseur in mines and minerals. I will </p><p>hurry all I can.” </p><p>^T"| WITH a darkening brow, Mr. </p><p> Dailey watched the stout figure</p><p>“ ■'* 1 climb slowly up the slope. At that </p><p>rate of speed it would take him a long time </p><p>to reach the tunnel. </p><p> “It’ll be all up with us now if he goes in-</p><p>side. If he sticks to the dump, he may bite </p><p>yet, but if he goes inside an’ once sees that </p><p>the veins ain’t even the same kind of rock </p><p>that the ore-dump carries, we’ll be out </p><p>twenty dollars’ worth of gold-dust. That’s </p><p>all. Confound old John! He's as slow as </p><p>cold molasses runnin’ up a fence in Winter. </p><p>He’s spoiled the best joke we ever planned </p><p>in Arizona— Look! There he goes now. </p><p>It’s all spoiled!” </p><p> Very slowly they saw Colonel Borden</p><p>climb up the shaley slope that scaled oil </p><p>under his feet, falling in a thunderous rattle </p><p>to the lower slope. They saw him grasp an </p><p>overhanging bush and draw himself to the </p><p>lip of the bank and then pass to the ore- </p><p>dump, over which he bent curiously. Once </p><p>or twice they saw him take a piece of rock </p><p>from the pile, scrape it, weigh it in each </p><p>hand, smell and taste it and finally drop it </p><p>into his coat pocket. He finished with the </p><p>ore-dump and passed to the screen of torn </p><p>sacking which he carefully examined from </p><p>front and rear. Finally he stepped back </p><p>again to the dump, took a great piece of ore- </p><p>bearing rock in his hand and coming back </p><p>to the entrance, passed behind the screen. </p><p>Then- </p><p> “Land o’ Goshen!” said Mr. Boaz fer-</p><p>vently." “Look yonder, will you? There </p><p>comes that old fool John Wilkes. See him </p><p>cornin’ down the hill? Too late o’ course!” </p><p> “Who—who?” Dailey gaped in every</p><p>direction except the right one, indicated by </p><p>Boaz’s stabbing forefinger. </p><p> “Wilkes—John—the old fool! He’s right</p><p>above the entry, goin’ down toward it! </p><p>See him?” </p><p> Dailey stared. Sure enough, they saw</p><p>against the hillside the figure of old, gray- </p><p>haired Mr. Wilkes, bare-headed, clutch- </p><p>ing his gun to his breast with both hands, </p><p>hastening down the slope of the hill just </p><p>above the tunnel. He had tied his pony to a </p><p>bush higher up on the crest among the </p><p>rocks. </p><p> “Stop him! Yell to him, Mike! Your</p><p>voice’ll carry further’n mine. Tell him to </p><p>come back or to get back up the hill before </p><p>the old man sees him. Y—o—u, John—get </p><p>back, I say!” </p><p> Mr. Wilkes, intent upon his work, as all</p><p>good workmen should be. did not hear the </p><p>shout, but Colonel Borden did. He thrust </p><p>his head out for one moment, waved a </p><p>reassuring hand and once more disappeared </p><p>behind the torn screen. Ten seconds later </p><p>Mr. Wilkes, sliding down most of the way </p><p>upon his haunches, made the last ten urds </p><p>of his descent, climbed to his feet and the </p><p>startled men in the buckboard saw him </p><p>drop to one knee, raise his gun and fire </p><p>straight through the screen of sacking.'* </p><p> “Good-”</p><p> Boaz never finished the sentence. The</p><p>roar of the double explosion—for John had </p><p>fired both barrels—echoed in thunder from </p><p>wall to wall of the narrow valley, and was </p><p>followed, long before it died away, by a series</p><p>of ear-splitting shrieks that would have </p><p>made a White Mountain Apache turn green </p><p>with envy. </p><p> They stood appalled and saw presently,</p><p>when the smoke pall had blown aside, old </p><p>John Wilkes, his gun sinking from his </p><p>nerveless hand, half sink half totter to the </p><p>ground. They could see his old knees </p><p>trembling. </p><p> Two seconds later the figure of Colonel</p><p>Borden tottered from behindthe screen. </p><p>He was roaring like a bull and both hands </p><p>were clasped firmly over his two hip- </p><p>pockets. </p><p> “Good Lord! John has plugged the</p><p>Colonel! Look at him run!” </p><p> They saw for one moment as in a ha.-e</p><p>old John Wilkes standing staring at the </p><p>apparition. The next moment he had </p><p>dropped his gun and sped straight up the </p><p>216 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>hiLL with the speed of an antelope and had </p><p>disappeared in the scrub toward his pony. </p><p>VII </p><p>THE two men, hardly waiting to tie </p><p>the ponies, sped quickly up the </p><p>slope only to lind the Colonel gasp- </p><p>ing upon the ore-dump. He was evidently </p><p>not seriously injured. </p><p> “Good Heavens, Colonel—” began</p><p>Dailey. </p><p> “111 kill him for this—I’ll have his</p><p>heart’s blood! That old devil sneaked up </p><p>behind me. Gentlemen, I have you for wit- </p><p>nesses—he shot me from behind! He fol- </p><p>lowed me all the way from his accursed </p><p>hotel and shot me just because I didn't like </p><p>the way he cooked-” </p><p> He thoughtlessly sat down upon a rock</p><p>and sprang up swearing. </p><p> “Both barrels, as I live! Great gosh,</p><p>Colonel!” Mr. Dailey was helpless with </p><p>laughter. “Where're you hit, Colonel?” </p><p> Colonel Borden glared at him, and</p><p>started to shake his fist in his face. The </p><p>necessity of using both hands prevented </p><p>him. </p><p> “You’re a pair of - robbers!” he</p><p>gritted between his teeth. “Where’s my </p><p>money. Where’s my three hundred dol- </p><p>lars?” </p><p> Boaz made shift to place it in the blood-</p><p>stained hip-pocket, hardly able to find the </p><p>pocket through laughter. lie at last shoved </p><p>the roll in and roared again to see the </p><p>Colonel wince. It was probably the first </p><p>time in his life that the acquisition of money</p><p>had caused him physical pain. He had </p><p>experienced it on several occasions when </p><p>he had lost it. </p><p> “Shoot him in the coat an’ vest. The</p><p>pants is mine,” cackled Mr. Boaz, feebly </p><p>waving his hands in front of his face. “There </p><p>couldn’t have been no shot in it, Colonel, or </p><p>he’d have killed you at that distance.” </p><p> “There couldn’t have been, hey?” The</p><p>irate Colonel was rapidly passing his hands </p><p>over his person. “Look here, will you? </p><p>Both pockets are filled with blood. My </p><p>Heavens! Do something quick to help me. </p><p>Are you going to let me die unaided?” </p><p> “What’s that stickin’ to your pants,</p><p>Colonel?” </p><p> Dailey bent forward and touched him</p><p>with a prodding finger. The Colonel </p><p>winced. </p><p> “As sure as I'm a livin* man it’s—gold!”</p><p>The la^t word was a shriek. “It's gold! </p><p>Gentlemen, I see it all now. I don't JiU t&lt;i </p><p>be suspicious, but I swear 1 believe now that </p><p>we know the real reason why John Wilkes </p><p>was willin' to let us pay him nine hundred </p><p>dollars fer this claim. As sure as a gun is </p><p>iron, that old devil has been saltin’ this </p><p>dump on us and he came mighty near gettin’ </p><p>us too. If it hadn’t been fer the Colonel </p><p>h*re—yes, sirs! That’s just what he was </p><p>doin’. I wouldn’t have believed that of old </p><p>John. He sure come up here to salt that </p><p>claim to fool us an’ he salted-” </p><p> “He — he — he — salted,” echoed Mr.</p><p>Boaz. </p><p> 'The Colonel!" they shrieked in unison,</p><p>falling up against each other in helpless </p><p>laughter, while the astonished Colonel, who </p><p>had been surreptitiously examining his </p><p>wounds, stood clutching his trousers in both </p><p>hands, glaring at them. </p><p> Together they got him to the buckboard,</p><p>but it was a half hour before they started </p><p>homeward, the ponies walking, the Colon </p><p>standing erect, one hand grasping firmh </p><p>the back of the front seat, with the other </p><p>holding the clothing away from the delicate </p><p>parts of his person, emitting ev&gt;.ry few mo- </p><p>ments groans and curses as the buckboard </p><p>hit the ruts and stones in the road. </p><p> Dailey and Boaz had openly cast aside</p><p>restraint. </p><p> “My lord, but you're lucky. Colonel!</p><p>When vou git yourself minted-" </p><p> “He—he—he,” cackled Mr. Boaz, “he kin</p><p>issue gold certificates now on hisself-' </p><p>“Gentlemen,” roared the now angry </p><p>Colonel, “this unseemly levity shall—must</p><p>stop! You hear me? Stop it instantly!” </p><p>Whereat the two men burst into renewed </p><p>laughter. </p><p> “Who is that cornin’ up the road, Mike?</p><p>It looks like a soldier?” </p><p>IT WAS a rider spurring a tired and </p><p>sweating horse up the canon trail, </p><p>and when he drew nearer they saw </p><p>that it was a trooper from the 1 ort and that </p><p>he had been riding hard. He reined in hii </p><p>sweating horse and dismounting handed a </p><p>letter to the Colonel. </p><p> “Sir, Mrs. Borden said I was not to halt</p><p>my horse till I gave you this.” </p><p> Letting go his hold on his trousers, which</p><p>settled to his knees, the Colonel put on his </p><p>glasses and tore open the letter. It was a </p><p>The Salters </p><p>217 </p><p>mere hasty scrawl, but it made him grasp </p><p>hastily at his clothing in his haste to do </p><p>something. It was a nervous scribble and </p><p>it read: </p><p> I have just found a note from May, saying that</p><p>she has run away to marry Mr. Needham. For </p><p>Heaven's sake, stop them at Preciosa. ll thej' are </p><p>to be married, have her married here, and spare us </p><p>the gossip. </p><p> “Go on!” roared the Colonel. “Get to</p><p>the railroad station as quick as you can. I </p><p>must catch the noon train. WTiat time is it </p><p>due there?” </p><p> “She t&gt;asses Preciosa at 12:45, but she</p><p>don’t stop. She just picks up the mail-sacks </p><p>on the fly.” </p><p> “It must stop—it shall stop. I ll flag it!”</p><p>“Oh! All right; but I’m bettin’ even </p><p>money she won’t stop. She won’t even </p><p>stop fer a cow on the track.” </p><p> “Well, for Heaven’s sake, get there and</p><p>stop talking. I must catch it. If it slows </p><p>up enough to pick up mail I can jump on it. </p><p>Where does she stop?” </p><p> “Catlin’s Crossin’ is the first stop to the</p><p>west of here. She’s past there now. Hold </p><p>on, everybody. I'm goin’ to the station.” </p><p>Dailey would not have missed that last </p><p>half-hour with the Colonel for the world. </p><p> Banging from rut to rut, rocketing</p><p>from stone to stone, the old buckboard </p><p>swung down the trail, the Colonel Hutching </p><p>his garments closer and closer to him, eying </p><p>the nearing line of the railroad with the </p><p>stern gaze of a conqueror; Boaz, clutching </p><p>fast at whatever came first within his reach </p><p>as the wagon swayed from side to side like </p><p>a log in a tidc-rip, muttered grimly: </p><p> “He’s shore got faith in his maker—of</p><p>buckboards. Look out' Here we are-” </p><p> The ponies sat back on their haunches 111</p><p>the dust as the buckboard stopped and </p><p>Colonel Borden, still wildly clutching his </p><p>fast escaping garments was flung forward </p><p>over the front seat in a grotesque bow to </p><p>the gray head of Mr. Wilkes, which, all un- </p><p>seen, thrust itself around the corner of the </p><p>station. Mr. Wilkes promptly withdrew. </p><p> “Three minutes to spare 1 There she</p><p>comes-” </p><p>A PLUME of black smoke showed </p><p>to the west of the curve and a deep, </p><p>steady hum from the approaching </p><p>train ciyne down the wind to them. </p><p> Dailey had done his work well the day</p><p>before. With the license in his pocket he </p><p>had sought out Needham and assured him </p><p>that there would be no hitch in his plans, </p><p>whereupon Mr. Needham had promptly </p><p>borrowed a buckboard from the Dailey </p><p>ranch and, driving two miles out upon the </p><p>post road, awaited the arrival of the mail- </p><p>stage. </p><p> May had had no trouble whatever in</p><p>carrying out her part of the plan. Her </p><p>uncle’s early departure from the Fort had </p><p>made all easy. She waited till her aunt </p><p>was busy in her own room, when she took </p><p>her suit-case, and walking to the post-office </p><p>climbed into the waiting stage, simply an- </p><p>nouncing that she desired to go to Pre- </p><p>ciosa. </p><p> Two miles out she found Needham await-</p><p>ing the arrival of the mail and it was with </p><p>wildly beating heart that she climbed out </p><p>and held up a pretty, flushed face for him </p><p>to kiss. </p><p> A half-hour later, the red flag at Catlin’s</p><p>Crossing bade the roaring train slacken, and </p><p>they were helped aboard by an obsequious </p><p>porter, who ushered them into the observa- </p><p>tion car where they were greeted by a smil- </p><p>ing clergyman who rose to meet them. </p><p> “Mr. Needham?”</p><p> Gerald bowed.</p><p> “This is most irregular, as of course you</p><p>know, but I am willing to earn* out the </p><p>request of Mr. Dailey, our mutual fricncL </p><p>Have you your license?” </p><p> Gerald produced it.</p><p> “When do you desire the ceremony per-</p><p>formed?” </p><p> “At once, if you please. The conductor.</p><p>I have no doubt, will act as a witness. </p><p>Are you ready, sweetheart?” </p><p> May Allardyce, blushing like the rosy-</p><p>fingered dawn, came out upon the observa-</p><p>tion platform just as they noticed a per- </p><p>ceptible slackening in the speed of the train. </p><p> “She’s slowin’ up to pick up the Treeiosa</p><p>mail, suh,” said the grinning porter. ^ </p><p> The clergyman opened his prayer-book</p><p>and began the service: </p><p> “Dearly Beloved, we are gathered to-</p><p>gether- </p><p> They heard a yell from the station plat-</p><p>form as ihe car shot past the station. They </p><p>saw a wildly moving figure dart out from </p><p>the building, both hands clutching w ildly at </p><p>his trousers. They heard a shrill shout: </p><p>“Somebody stop him. Hc*ll make it </p><p>vit.” </p><p>218 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> What they had not seen was Colonel Bor-</p><p>den as he prepared for the rush I hat was to </p><p>land him on the car where he would try to </p><p>prevent this elopement. He forgot that he </p><p>no lunger had authority. He saw the train </p><p>slacken its speed as it rounded the curve and </p><p>he darted forward just as the gray-bearded </p><p>Mr. Wilkes shot around the corner of the </p><p>building and seized a coiled lariat from the </p><p>saddle of a sleeping cow-pony. </p><p> ‘‘I'll ketch him by the off hock,” he</p><p>shrilled as he swung the loop. </p><p> It left his hand opening and closing with</p><p>a vicious snap, and it settled about the right </p><p>foot of the fleeing Colonel Borden. </p><p> The next moment, the pony bracing him-</p><p>self for the shock, the onlookers were dimly </p><p>aware, through a great cloud of dust, of a </p><p>prostrate figure on the cinder platform, of </p><p>a struggling pony sitting back on its </p><p>haunches, of two figures standing very </p><p>•	lose together on the rear platform of the</p><p>rapidly moving train with the tall, black- </p><p>garbed figure of a clergyman standing be- </p><p>hind them swaying to the swing and toss of </p><p>the trucks. </p><p> In an instant a sharp knife had fallen</p><p>on the taut lariat and Mr. Wilkes dashed </p><p>around the corner of the station and, run- </p><p>ning like a deer, sought the seclusion of his </p><p>ow n home. </p><p> Two perfect strangers picked the Colonel</p><p>up, brushed him down and pinned up hib </p><p>more obvious rents. It was then that </p><p>Dailey came up to him. Boaz had disap- </p><p>peared with Wilkes and was not to be seen. </p><p> “I've lost everything except my three</p><p>hundred dollars that 1 started in to get </p><p>today, he said when he had exhausted his </p><p>stock of profanity. “I’ve lost everything, </p><p>Dailey, except that accursed claim and I'm</p><p>not sureof that. I wonder if that old Wilkes </p><p>did actually salt it on us? Do you suppose </p><p>there’s anything in that claim, Dailey? I </p><p>suppose I'm lucky to have saved my three </p><p>hundred dollars.” </p><p> “Well, Colonel/’ quoth the cow-puncher</p><p>thoughtfully. "You know the old miner s </p><p>sayin’: ‘Gold is where you find it.’ My ad- </p><p>vice is when you’ve got a place that you </p><p>know contains gold, even if there's only a </p><p>small amount of it, don't say anything to </p><p>anybody about it. Just set right down </p><p>on it!” </p><p> And Colonel Borden, waiting for the</p><p>buckboard to take him back to the Post, </p><p>reached behind him for an empty canta- </p><p>loup box and—sat down. </p><p> THE CAMP-FIRE</p><p>A.

I </p><p>have roughed it at sea and ar-.-und the ports, but </p><p>these art- merely incidentals. </p><p> Was bom t went}'-five years ago near Glasgow.</p><p>Scotland. Belong to a family of seafarers on both </p><p>sides. Father was a shipmaster, sail and steam, alfo </p><p>several uncles and cousins. One uncle. Captain </p><p>Hinton, Lrained the Earl of Dunraven (CUp Chal- </p><p>lenger) in the art uf sailing. First adventure when </p><p>u kid was in climbing to the royal yard of a big '"ur- </p><p>mast bark. Finished my education in Technical </p><p>College in Glasgow and aboard of ships.	^</p><p>The Camp-Fire </p><p>219 </p><p>TJTAVE knocked about since seventeen years of </p><p>age and have traversed the briny in square- </p><p>riggers, Spanish iron-orc boats, Norwegian coal- </p><p>t ramps, Atlantic and South American cattle-ships, </p><p>liners and freighters, and am familiar with almost </p><p>every craft that floats, besides being a student of </p><p>marine history and author of several articles upon</p><p>old-time shipping. Have had “my hands in the </p><p>tar-pot,'' as they say at sea, and can turn to with </p><p>any sailor at “hand, reef, or steer.” </p><p> Have, for the love of the thing and local color,</p><p>beach-combed around most European and American </p><p>ports, hanging around wharves, ships, and living in </p><p>sailors’ boarding-houses. Have also hauled trawls </p><p>with the Banks fishermen and worked with them on </p><p>Cape Sable, Roseway and La Have. Only last </p><p>month when driving for home from off La Have </p><p>Bank to Digby, N. S., we ran out of water, and for </p><p>two days we had nothing to drink but a suck at </p><p>some chopped ice taken from off the fish in the hold. </p><p>In the opinion of the gang, it took more nerve to eat </p><p>that slimy ice than to die of thirst. </p><p>DY THE BYE, I recollect a close shave we had </p><p>once. I was on a big cargo-steamcr bound </p><p>around Land's End to London, England. It was a </p><p>dark, foggy night, and the vessel was in the vicinity </p><p>of the Wolf Rock—we could hear the horn. It was </p><p>end of first watch, midnight, and firemen were draw- </p><p>ing fires. When steam went down, engineers drew it </p><p>off from steam steering-gear. The Wolf Rock Light- </p><p>house could be seen dead ahead, and when the </p><p>quartermaster tried to pull the wheel to port, it re- </p><p>fused to budge—no steam. Mate and man strug- </p><p>gled at the wheel, but could not move it. Steamer </p><p>in the meantime ploughing straight for the rock. </p><p>When in almost hair-raising proximity, steam was </p><p>turned into the gear again, and we swung clear. </p><p>Missed an iceberg once on the Banks of Newfound- </p><p>land in about as narrow a shave. </p><p>T CAN think of nothing else, except the usual </p><p>hazards one bucks against at sea, where, if you </p><p>lose your grip on a rope or jackstay, you go plump </p><p>into eternity. Never was a passenger on a voyage— </p><p>always worked and enjoyed it. If I sailed with my </p><p>father, I had to work harder than ever. He was </p><p>trained in “Bluenose” and “Down-East" windjam- </p><p>mers, and still retained the characteristics peculiar </p><p>to these craft. Have taken a great delight in rough- </p><p>ing it. Always glad to get away from boiled shirts, </p><p>collar and tie. Hate society, especially literary </p><p>''high-brows,” and prefer to swap pipes and yams </p><p>in the odoriferous gloom of a foc'sle with a crowd of </p><p>sh&lt;'11-backs, and with the heave of open water undi-r </p><p>your feet. On a fishing schooner I slept in my </p><p>dollies for throe weeks on end and never washed or </p><p>shaved for a month—they arc the only craft I have </p><p>been on where t hey do that. In other vessels, even </p><p>coal-boats, you can undress and keep yourself clean, </p><p>but in fishermen it is impossible. </p><p> ffXCUSE this verbose and rather rambling ac-</p><p>count. I am sorry that I can not scare up any- </p><p>thing really exciting, but if the foregoing is any use </p><p>to you, you ire welcome to use it. In addition to </p><p>writing &amp;ea-6ction, am a marine artist—-probably </p><p>the best known in Canada; have written hundreds</p><p>of special and technical artides, and have even per- </p><p>petrated a book of deep-sea poetry. </p><p>HERE’S a word from one of us who is </p><p>far afield—fighting in the big war, but </p><p>in a part of the world from which we receive </p><p>few war bulletins. The envelope that </p><p>brought me his letter had been two months </p><p>on the way, and of the Lhree postage-stamps </p><p>it bore, one was German, the two others Aus- </p><p>tralian. Presumably Neu Pommem had </p><p>been so recently captured by the Australian </p><p>forces that, though its name was promptly </p><p>changed to New Britain, it had as yet no </p><p>stamps of its own and those of both sides </p><p>were current. </p><p> Australian Imperial Expeditionary Force</p><p> 3rd Battalion N.

I wrote you last </p><p>from Honolulu, I tiiink. After leaving those delight- </p><p>ful islands, I sailed south to Australia, visiting Sa- </p><p>moas, etc., en route. </p><p> THE outbreak of hostilities I joined the</p><p>Forces being raided in Sydney and was selected </p><p>to go to the Tropics in a Special Naval and Military </p><p>Expeditionary Force of men who had seen previous </p><p>active service. After being in various places in </p><p>New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago we </p><p>arrived here in Rabaul, New Britain (Neu Pom- </p><p>mcm). Rabaul is the capital of German New </p><p>Guinea, which embraced all the islands around h&lt; re. </p><p>It is a very pretty place and the tropical scenery </p><p>surrounding it is beautiful, as all such scenery always </p><p>is. The natives around the coast are quiet and very </p><p>well behaved, but those a few miles in the interior </p><p>are savage cannibals to whom human life is value- </p><p>less and human flesh a great delicacy. New Britain, </p><p>like the larger island of New Guinea, has never been </p><p>explored and offers a splendid Gdd for some enter- </p><p>prising individual with aspirations in that direction. </p><p> You must excuse my not referring in any way to</p><p>the military situation here. That is strictly taboo, </p><p>for obvious reasons. I have not seen a copy of your </p><p>valuable magazine for a long time now. but hope to </p><p>procure some of liic back numbers in Svdney, later </p><p>on.—C. 1314. </p><p>BACK NUMBERS-AND THANKS </p><p>*	|'HAT what is practically an all-fiction</p><p>magazine should be so valued by its </p><p>readers that its back issues are carefully </p><p>treasured is a sincere and very practical </p><p>compliment to that magazine, and -1Jtvir-</p><p>ture is duly proud that it is thus valued. </p><p>That so many of our readers should keep 3 </p><p>complete file of all the back Adventures, a </p><p>considerable number even having them </p><p>220 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>bound in permanent form; that the demand </p><p>for back copies should have exhausted </p><p>practically all of the supply; that this de- </p><p>mand is so strong that we have to use form </p><p>letters for reply and to publish this state- </p><p>ment covering the situation—in short, well, </p><p>it certainly makes me feel good that Adven- </p><p>ture has won so firm a place in the regard </p><p>and affection of its readers. It is rather a </p><p>unique accomplishment for an all-fiction </p><p>magazine. </p><p>WHILE I’m at it I’ll also voice my ap- </p><p>preciation of the surprisingly large </p><p>proportion of you who have read the maga- </p><p>zine from its very first issue or who began </p><p>one, two, three or four years ago and have </p><p>never missed a month since. Some day, </p><p>too, I'll print some of the letters showing </p><p>how much Adventure readers will do or give </p><p>to get a copy of the magazine where </p><p>magazines are hard to get. </p><p> Now, as to the back issues still in stock:</p><p>■^TO ISSUES of Adventure for 1910, 1911, </p><p>1912 and 1913 can be supplied, with </p><p>the exception that we have 75 copies of </p><p>June, 1912, and 25 of September, 1912. Of </p><p>the 26 issues of 1910, 1911 and 1912 there </p><p>are only 5 of which we have enough copies </p><p>for our own office files. Incidentally, we </p><p>have no bound volumes for sale, but we can </p><p>furnish our readers, free of charge, with a </p><p>limited number of printed indexes for all </p><p>volumes (6 issues to a volume), beginning </p><p>with Vol. IV (May to October, 1912). </p><p> For 1914 we have about 25 copies of each</p><p>month, which can be secured for the regular </p><p>price, 15 cents each. </p><p> For 1915, the current year, we can at</p><p>present supply a reasonable number of back </p><p>copies, though two or three months are </p><p>already beginning to run low. </p><p>AT THIS writing there are, we find after </p><p>a careful raking over of the whole build- </p><p>ing, some 20 extra copies of June, 1914, con- </p><p>taining one of Dr. Cochrane's Dan Wheeler </p><p>stories, “A Drop of Doom.” They may be </p><p>gone by the time this reaches your eye. Of </p><p>June, 1915, containing “The Crimson </p><p>Chamber,” by the same author, there is now </p><p>a supply of extra copies, but it is fast </p><p>diminishing. There are no extra copies of </p><p>any of his other stories.

S. Wightman, with a story of the </p><p>Philippines in this number, follows custom: </p><p> To begin with, I am a Southerner, having been</p><p>born in South Carolina when the seventies were ap- </p><p>proaching the eighties in the eighteen hundreds, and </p><p>having spent my boyhood and early youth in that </p><p>State. </p><p> fiowever. I must early have been bitten by the</p><p>wanderlust bug, for in the late nineties, having lost </p><p>both my mother and my father, and being free to </p><p>roam as far as comparatively empty' pockets would </p><p>carry me. I trekked to Chicago in search of adven- </p><p>ture and a living. 1 found the adventure grinding </p><p>out the living. </p><p>TN THE Fall of 1900 I entered Princeton, and </p><p>was graduated with the ckt;s of 1904, having </p><p>been an editor of that staid old exponent of classi- </p><p>cism, The Nassau Lit. following this I spent a year </p><p>up on the Delaware tutoring a couple of scions of </p><p>wealth, a year in und about New York, and then </p><p>made up my mind to go to the Philippines, as the </p><p>most likely method of gratifying my desire To see </p><p>the world before settling down in any particular part </p><p>of it. </p><p>OAVENG taken the precaution of securing a </p><p>Government position, I went out in the Autumn </p><p>of 1906, possessed of a very hazy idea of what our </p><p>overseas provinces were like and intending to spend </p><p>a couple of years in them. 1 actually spent seven; </p><p>and if Jacob got as much fun out of his first period </p><p>of service for Rachel, I don’t wonder that he under- </p><p>took another seven when he found he had been </p><p>duped with Leah. During most of tliis time J acted </p><p>as Secretary- to the Vice-Governor and Acting </p><p>Governor-General, Secretary to the University of </p><p>the Philippines and Assistant to the Philippine Com-</p><p>mission, and I had the opportunity oi seeing the </p><p>Islands and the workings of their government in and </p><p>out., upside down and crosswise fur good measure. </p><p> Also I spent a good deal of lime on different o&gt; -'a-</p><p>sioni in Japan and China, so much so, indeed, Lh.n I </p><p>The Camp-Fire </p><p>221 </p><p>feel quite as at home in the Empire of the Rising </p><p>Sun and along the China coast as I do in New York. </p><p>1 have cruised about Borneo and the Dutch East </p><p>Indies, made the tourist's visit to India, and travel- </p><p>ed pretty generally through Europe, returning, from </p><p>one visit, to the United States by way of London </p><p>and the very excellently managed Trans-Siberian </p><p>Railroad to Vladivostok. </p><p>T HAVE also Summered on a ranch in Montana </p><p> and camped out in the heart of the Rockies;</p><p>but I may as well confess 1 have never seen a typical </p><p>“bad man" nor a cow-puncher with the heart of Sir </p><p>Galahad and the shoulders of Hercules—a Bayard </p><p>in chaps. Nobody ever called me “tenderfoot," and </p><p>if they were impressed, favorably or otherwise, by </p><p>my London breeches, they were too courteous to </p><p>show it. I have, however, seen a rancher wearing a </p><p>revolver; in fact I saw him buckle it on, with evi- </p><p>dently a good deal of inward protest, as he muttered </p><p>“There isn’t a chance of that damn badger’s being </p><p>there now!" </p><p> I also found that, although I do not consider my-</p><p>self more than a fair horseman, I could actually out- </p><p>ride and out manage a goodly number of the men on </p><p>the ranch—the average ranch hand could stay on a </p><p>bronco doing a moderate job of bucking about as </p><p>long as a fly could stick to a whirling buzz-saw. But </p><p>it is only fair to say it was primarily a sheep ranch— </p><p>the horses and cattle were incidental to the sheep. </p><p>HTHE most complete typical cowboy outfit, from </p><p>spur straps to sombrero, I ever saw was worn </p><p>by a small boy of fourteen; his father had ordered it </p><p>from a Montgomery-Ward catalogue. lie was an </p><p>interesting boy, by the way, whose sallow face made </p><p>his name, Alfonso, seem less incongruous than his </p><p>twang of the plains otherwise would. He said little, </p><p>but took in everything which went on, evidently </p><p>studying and contrasting our speech and our ways </p><p>with those of the men with whom he ordinarily </p><p>associated. </p><p> And with all his boyish instinct for histrionics, he</p><p>wished to be accepted on a man’s basis, showing a </p><p>good-natured willingness to do more than his proper </p><p>share of duties around camp. The moment the old </p><p>herder had finished eating, he would hurry off on </p><p>some suddenly discovered urgent business with the </p><p>sheep; but Alfonso, although his billet was herder's </p><p>assistant for the drive, which freed him from the re- </p><p>sponsibilities of camp tending, never failed lo help </p><p>with the tin dishes. And I think the way we scrub- </p><p>bed those tin dishes was nothing short of heresy in</p><p>the old herder’s eyes; to him dinner was no less </p><p>palatable because of the breakfast grease on the </p><p>plate. </p><p>| KNOW of only one time that I stood actually </p><p> face to face with death: that was un a submarine</p><p>in Manila Bay in which I was cruising as a guest. </p><p>We were running awash, preparatory to submerging, </p><p>with the heavy cover of the conning-towcr closed </p><p>bat not sere wed home as it must be before the boat </p><p>dives. The main tank was open—the one which </p><p>really changes her from a surface t*&gt; an under-sea </p><p>cr.ut. and which, because when full it only barely </p><p>sinks her to the water's level, is made to withstand </p><p>u*e pressure of the water at no greater depth than </p><p>B&lt;Jow this its intake mu®’, be dosed. </p><p> The commander, a young ensign, was in the cou-</p><p>ning-tower, the crew at their various posts, and I </p><p>sitting on a stool amidships with, it must be con- </p><p>fessed, a certain squeamishness at the pit of my </p><p>stomach in this sinking under the sea bottled up in </p><p>a two-by-four eggshell, when without warning the </p><p>boat plunged downward and came to rest under </p><p>some thirty feet of water. Why the main tank did </p><p>not give way, drowning us out of hand, only the god </p><p>of strains knows. </p><p>TT ALL happened so quickly that the inrush of </p><p> water through the conning-tower. drenching the</p><p>commander, was my first intimation that something </p><p>was wrong. But he was as cool as an Autumn night. </p><p>Slipping from his post in the conning-towcr, he </p><p>supervised the dosing of the valve of that deadly </p><p>main tank; after which he pushed his wav back </p><p>through the inpouring water and screwed home the </p><p>top of the tower. Then, a little grim about the mouth </p><p>but without comment, he continued his cruise. It </p><p>was not until we were back in his cabin on the </p><p>molher-ship, tidying up for luncheon, that I learned </p><p>just what had happened. </p><p>gUT the thrill of danger has been distinctly ex- </p><p>ceptional in most of my adventures. A couple </p><p>of years ago in the mid-pacific with the wiie of a </p><p>high American official who was going out tor station </p><p>in the Orient, I was leaning over the rail watching the </p><p>Asiatic steerage swarming over the main deck for- </p><p>ward in the bright sunshine, when the whistle sud- </p><p>denly sounded the fire call. There was the rush of </p><p>the Chinese crew onto that part of the deck, and a </p><p>thin line of blue smoke curled upward out f an </p><p>open hatch. </p><p> It was exciting, but I fdt no thrill, because it</p><p>seemed impossible that the great ship could be de- </p><p>stroyed by fire, and so I continued to chat. My </p><p>companion of the moment, to mask a vague un- </p><p>easiness, made some laughing, but not unkind, refer- </p><p>ence to the destruction of the dothes of the Jap pas- </p><p>sengers who had now been herded together in wide- </p><p>eyed silence. The fire was quickly extinguished; </p><p>but the real laugh came that afternoon when the</p><p>offi dal's wife learned that the only thing destroyed </p><p>had been her trunks, and these trunks contained </p><p>almost her entire supply of gowns, which were </p><p>nearly as important for her husband's succcss as </p><p>were his own tact and experience. </p><p>JUST now I am living in a \1rginia village which </p><p>has traditions behind it; and in its friendly if </p><p>inquisitive atmosjjhere I am tnnng to put on paper </p><p>some of the things I have lived and seen, as well as </p><p>some of the livings I have only imagined myscU </p><p>living and seeing. _ " </p><p> HO knows about swords?

A strange place to find your magazine, you </p><p>will say, but to me it is very welcome as I had not</p><p>seen it sincc last June. I read with a great deal of </p><p>interest about the American Legion and am writing </p><p>to ask you to put down my name. </p><p> As you will see from the envelope, I am now in</p><p>second regiment of the Foreign Legion. I enlisted </p><p>as a private soldier last August, and now command a </p><p>scction of &lt;S7 men, and am as far advanced in grade as </p><p>a foreigner can be in the French Army.-, Sous- </p><p>offidcr, 2e Regiment Etranger, Bataillon C, Sectcur </p><p>Postal No. fi, France. </p><p>YV/AS very glad to receive your letter of the first, </p><p>and I thank you very much for your kindness </p><p>in sending me the Adventure. I shall be very glad </p><p>to receive it, as you can easily imagine our greatest </p><p>hardship in this sort of war is the deadly monotony. </p><p>Almost impossible to find books or periodicals, so </p><p>you can imagine with what joy I seized on the Ad- </p><p>venture that I found in a German advanced post. </p><p> I have also received a letter and application blank</p><p>from the American Legion. They are leaving by </p><p>this mail, but 1 doubt very much if they will ever </p><p>arrive at destination. I am, however, writing Dr. </p><p>llausmann under separate cover, </p><p>1WISH I could tell you something about our life </p><p>here, but I have no ability in the line of descrip- </p><p>tion. However, it is entirely different lo anything </p><p>else 1 have ever been in. Under false names I </p><p>fought with Davilla against Bonilla in Honduras, </p><p>and with Madero against I&gt;ia/ but this is a game </p><p>played with a different set of rules. The king of in- </p><p>fantry encounters i- the hand-grenade. The high- </p><p>power rirte is a joke. 1 have scm for the last ten </p><p>months continual firing from one trench to another, </p><p>sometimes at disuni es of fifty t.*.i enty-five </p><p>meters. 1 have seen uncalled-for panic lake both </p><p>sides, on a dark night when each trench vould be a </p><p>continual line of fire, hundreds ol men firing hun- </p><p>dreds, of cartridges each and 1 have never seen a man </p><p>killed by a rille-ball. </p><p> But if you want to see a shambles, visit a trench</p><p>just after a few hand-grenades have been thrown </p><p>into it. The great sport here on both sides is hand- </p><p>grenading the other fellow. How playedr- Well, </p><p>you leave your trench on a dark night with three or </p><p>four grenades, nothing else, then you pull yourself </p><p>along the ground toward the opposite trench. No </p><p>crawling on hands and knees goes—too dangerous. </p><p>Slow business. I have taken over three hours to </p><p>cover a hundred yards. Arrived at the other tren.h </p><p>you keep still until you hear the relief coming, gener- </p><p>ally between eleven and twelve, or between one and </p><p>two. When the relief is in the trench opposite you, </p><p>you jump up, throw your grenades and run ;ts if the </p><p>monster of Sleepy Hollow were after you. If you </p><p>arc a good runner, the surprise has been complete, </p><p>and you know the moment to drop, you should get </p><p>out of it alive. </p><p>AS I said before, if you want to see a shambles,</p><p>visit a trench or a communicating boyau after </p><p>one of these visits. I have seen a whole half sec- </p><p>tion, thirty-two men, put out of business with four </p><p>grenades and the Germans have undoubtedly had </p><p>much the same experience, if we can believe the </p><p>prisoners we take. Also in attacking or dvfending </p><p>trenches, the grenade rules king. Nothing like it </p><p>for cleaning out a trench or for stopping a masted </p><p>charge.
