One day</seg><seg type="columnLine">while hunting in the hills I came into a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley that made my mouth water. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a bare copper mountain standing over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a timbered slope leading to a liLlle stream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that led to a big meadow and lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself in a little green marsh. Willows by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marsh, and oaks in the meadows, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pines up the slope. It was a lost valley--</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one way in. You pass a lot of loose-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt scenery till you turn around a bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">granite knoll and look into--paradise!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's Lost Deer Valley, all right,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded Dolan. "It's a fine place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big man smiled a bit at the rhapsody.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton's regular-featured, fine-drawn face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was alight. If it were not for his square</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw and level eyes, Dolan might have ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">praised liim differently. But, though Carl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton was a "city man," he was not a tender-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot. He was an engineer who had sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veyed part of the desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After I went away, I got office w'ork,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued Carlton. "It lasted five years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then I got--sick. Meantime I'd been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaming about that valley. So, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sickness pulled me down for keeps, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to come out here with my wife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">settle down on the place. I had enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">money tp buy about one-third of the valley;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I bought it. The fellow who owned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place was Ebenezer Finch. A fine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholesouled, noble character. A regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">prince!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolan grinned. The bitter words seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to caricature the miser of Lost Deer Valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the stoop-shouldered, sharp-faced, red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired slouch whose cheating and sancti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony were known through the county.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He only asked a reasonable price for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two hundred acres," continued the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer. "It's right at the lower end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley, straddling the creek and strad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dling the road that runs out. I made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">'topographic survey and planned an irriga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion system. The ground makes an easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope toward the lower end of the valley; so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by diverting the stream where it enters my</seg><seg type="columnLine">proj&gt;ertv on the higher ground. I could run</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ditch along the inner rim of the hills and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot the water down to any place I liked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stream runs all year from Lost Deer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring; so I figured I'd have water enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to raise anything.

"Hosses."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It was the horses," nodded Carlton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ebenezer Finch suddenly brought three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred head of stock over from his Esca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lante ranch, and they drank the water at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">source."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you speak to him abouL it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sjjeak? 1 spoke, argued, raved, prayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swore! He just stood there and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniveled his regrets." Carlton s bitter voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a high-pitched, mournful intonation</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mimicked Finch's whine exactly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm right sorry abaout it," he mocked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but I don't see's haow I kin change</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. O' course, you got your rights to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower stream. 1 don't deny no man his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights.

The law sez the man on the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream kin only hold water fer domestic an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock purposes; so I'm right glad to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye hev what I kin let through." Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his own voice. "- him! He's en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titled to the upper stream for stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposes only, so he brought in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ' Um. How did the talk wind up?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted Dolan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why--he almost cried. Said I mustn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge him wrongly. Told me how good a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend he was. Described every neighborly</seg><seg type="columnLine">act he'd done. I didn't know whether to</seg><seg type="columnLine">apologize or knock him down. Finally he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook hands and left me standing there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering. That was two months ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After that he'd drop over and give me help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful hints on how to run my ranch. Mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, not a drop from Lost Deer Creek.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I	couldn't decide whether I was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped or victimized till finally I stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to his full history."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dan Dolan chuckled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What happened next?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--1 can't afford to nurse a dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch; so I put it up to him straight. First</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, 'Harsh words butter no parsnips;'</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he just yelled. I'm not very strong;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I used a fence-rail. Then, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">my temper went down, I regretted</seg><seg type="columnLine">things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I MADE threats. I said I'd get</seg><seg type="columnLine">that water if I had to clean out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock and him into the bargain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was a month ago. Since then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley hasn't been healthy for any one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some one's been poisoning his horses, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody tried to burn my house. I sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">now with a shotgun alongside my bed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wife's close to hysterics."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did you learn about Finch?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Dolan suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The old Government land-agent. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows the whole county." Carlton tolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">off victims on his fingers. "A man named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brady had the ranch before me. He died</seg><seg type="columnLine">two years ago, after selling the land back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch cheaply. The man before that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dingle or Dingwall. The man before that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one Tom Fulton."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tom Fulton?" interrupted Dolan. "Ful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton? Yeh, you're right; it was Tom Fulton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Go on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The man before that was named Mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ris, and I forget the rest. Every one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them lacked water, couldn't irrigate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to sell the ranch back to Finch--very</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheap. Two of them had lawsuits but</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't prove anything. In other words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ebenezer Finch uses the prettiest little</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley in the county as bait for a legal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">logical skin-game. He sells the ranch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">parches the land, terrorizes the victims in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one way or another and then gets the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch back through a friendly deal!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan's stubby fingers drummed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, and he stared at Carlton as if to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of his estimate of the man. He saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">decent, clean young American, neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">blond nor dark, neither brilliant nor wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, but just an ordinary well-educated</seg><seg type="columnLine">young fellow who looked as if he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be worth helping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right," he nodded. "It's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swindle. You're stung. Might as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack up your duds and mosey along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only--I wouldn't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean--fight it out?" asked Carlton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stick," grunted the big saloon-keeper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then suddenly he became halting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">diffident, as if trying to pick the words to</seg><seg type="columnLine">outline his attitude. "I'm sort of neutral,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he explained. "I'm jest watchin' on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side-lines. Mebbe I'm playin' my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">game, at that. We'll see. I got no special</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in you. I'm only a booster for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">county. What we need is decent people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ou and your wife seem like what we want.</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mirage	5</seg><seg type="columnLine">If your sort always gits froze out, there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothin' for this county but booze and</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughs forever. Savvy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton had hoped for understanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this burly, rough-handed saloon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper in shirt-sleeves, but such idealism</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the owner of the worst "sin palace"</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the county was unexpected. The big</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss caught his look and frowned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeh, I know what you're thinkin',"</seg><seg type="columnLine">boomed Dolan's heavy voice in its choppy</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner. "Dolan keeps a dance-haU.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Booze. Women. Dolan, the merchant, may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be different. He's gittin' a little old.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beginnin' to look ahead like a merchant</seg><seg type="columnLine">should. This country's got to have decent</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. She's goin' to git 'em!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton was beginning to gage this new</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend. The big, heavy-browed fighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood alone in this community, and, a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">chastened by the years, without wife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">family or close pals, he was starting to feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">his loneliness. His talk was not reform.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was friendship. The engineer knew he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to the right place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I won't take up your fight, but you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' to git a square deal!" continued Dolan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mebbe I'll have a scheme for you pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon. Mebbe not. Anyhow, go back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight it out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will!" said the engineer, arising and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripping the other's big hand for just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment and then letting it go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Effusiveness would have spoiled things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he knew it. Then with a nod he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked to the door and mounted his bay</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse and started for home, heartened by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knowledge that the toughest, shrewdest</seg><seg type="columnLine">old ruffian in the district was a friend and</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly an ally. He was ignorant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">political and social conditions within this</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumultuous county, ignorant of the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious motives of Dolan and totally</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorant of the size of the battle he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered into. He only knew that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained a friend whose advice and backing</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be well worth while, and, thus satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied, he started on the long trail toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green valley under the copper mountain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO hours later Carlton was riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">along a winding road on die side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a barren, rocky mountain range,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sometimes, when the dust settled or side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills failed to obstruct his view, he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">6</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great, hazy country spread iTelow him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the westward, shimmering yellow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown in the heat-wave. Far to the north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward lay Dolan's settlement, its buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden by the mist of the distance. Far to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south the gray heat-wave blurred the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles that led to the county-seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eastward, to the left, the rocks on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep mountain range above the rider re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected baleful glares from the late afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight, and above those rocks he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the tip of the big copper dome that stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his home. One mile more and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be in the valley. The rider managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to urge his sweaty horse into a gallop just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">something stinging and vicious whined</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton jumped. He jerked back on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reins. The horse stood on its hind legs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A muffled report came from somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the boulders above. Carlton's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">squinted toward a mass of gray rocks under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulder of the copper mountain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The devil!" muttered the engineer, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided, while the horse pranced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another bullet zipped past the animal's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose and spattered into a red rock below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton made up his mind instantly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">jabbed spurs into the bay so savagely that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it laid back its ears and flew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over shale rock, over hard ledges, over</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandy washes the panting bay sped toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gateway of gray-green boulders that</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked the entrance to the valley. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets ceased coming. The marksman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage-point was out of range, hidden by</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs and side-hills. The engineer's mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was working fast. The man who fired at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a rifle. Carlton only had a pistol in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster under his light khaki jacket. If he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get to close quarters, he might inves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tigate things. That was his plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The horse reached the comer of Lost Deer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gap and started to turn in. Carlton halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, dismounted, slapped the animal on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flank and walked deliberately along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer rim of the granile gates of Lost Deer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valley. The horse started for home. Carl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton started to climb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warily, carefully, trying to give no hint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his coming, the engineer scrambled up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward over hot ledges of gray stone or little</seg><seg type="columnLine">wastes of yellow sand. Once the ugly flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of a diamond-back rattler disputed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from the top of a bluish rock, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave it the right of way. Higher up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pungent smell told him he was coming into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nest of them; so he detoured. Still higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came upon the trail of a bobcat in a patch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of streak)- brown dirt, but he noticed it only</seg><seg type="columnLine">subconsciously. He was on the spine of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge now, and ahead was the giant pile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray rocks where his enemy had lurked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton surmised who it was, but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not quite sure. Ebenezer Finch seemed too</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanctimonious for this sort of business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer began to cr?jwl. Hot rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">blistered his hands, and the sun heated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal on his blue pistol-barrel, but he wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sweat from Ills brow and kept going</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. He made for the western edge in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to keep off the sky-line. His fooi</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped on a rock which hit another, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck another, until a little avalanche of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock and dirt thundered down the hill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered momentum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bullet whistled past Carlton. A rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared almost in front of him, and a wisp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke blew around the corner of a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock. Carlton started dodging forward in</seg><seg type="columnLine">zigzag leaps. The rifle cracked again, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reached the rock. The smoke liad just</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from its east side; so he ran around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west side, just as he heard the lever of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle throwing another cartridge into place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wild with anger, aching to deal with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">assassin, the engineer forgot his shortening</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind and cha ged like a wild bull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A vague figure moved in front of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurred by the gloomy shade of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock. Carlton pulled trigger just as a big-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore rifle delivered its thundering load</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his hat. Carlton pulled trigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice more. The gusts of Are and smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the place into a smelly inferno.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yow!" came a shrill, agonized scream</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the figure in front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton's finger twitched on the trigger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he refrained. The man with the Win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chester hurled it away and let it smash on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks w'hile he hunched over and held</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right leg, moaning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does this mean?" roared Carlton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh! Ouch!" cried Ebenezer Finch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down and swayed while his lean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">WTinkled face contorted with pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton did not know whether to shoot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike, swear or laugh. The cold-blooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt at assassination made him furious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the ludicrous figure rendered him help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less to act.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" he rasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It hurts!" complained Finch. "Wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">till I git my boot off. Ow! Wow!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss of Mirage</seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Serves you right!" snapped Carlton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I ought to have finished you, you dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneak!" He stood undecided for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed between humanity and inhumanity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but generosity won. "Let me see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg. Humph. Flesh-wound. Too bad it</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't drill your head! Cut away those</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty clothes and give it a wash. Lick it if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have to. Now take my bandanna and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bind it. I ought to ram the thing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">your sneaking throat! Confound you, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't you fight like a man? Are you just</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain dog? What's the idea in trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill me, anyhow? Or are you just trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to scare me out of the valley. Speak!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finch quit binding the red wound for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second and looked up with the old expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of vague reproach and wonderment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You pizened them hosses!" came his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mournful, regretful answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You lie!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Tain't fair," whined Finch, ignoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outburst. "The first time, I let it pass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Youth will have its fling/ sez I; so I let it</seg><seg type="columnLine">go. Next time, eight yearlin's was found</seg><seg type="columnLine">daid; so I calc'lated I'd speak to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly. You only told me to git off'n</seg><seg type="columnLine">your ranch." This was with reproach un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterable. " 'Twam't neighborly. I let</seg><seg type="columnLine">that go at last, because I sez, 'Time heals all</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds,' sez I. Then six four-year-olds</seg><seg type="columnLine">died las' week, an' las' night ten mewls</seg><seg type="columnLine">went." And he nodded his head sadly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of his wrongs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You He!" blurted Carlton. "You lie!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm not poisoning horses!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You sez one day as haow you'd git water</seg><seg type="columnLine">ef you hed to clean out me an' that stock,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">accused Finch most regretfully. "I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right sorry. 'Peared that neighbors ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to git along. I was right hurt about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ouch!" The last was addressed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The monotonous insistence of that querul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous voice was beginning to get in its work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton somehow felt himself on the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fensive, and it maddened him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You sniveling old crook!" he growled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You know what's the trouble as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finch shrugged a tired shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm right sorry abaout that water,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sighed. "Seems jest like it's only come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make trouble between good neighbors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ef I could send that stock back, I'd do it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I hain't got the money right naow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I m right sorry." He wagged a mournful</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, but his calculating little eyes rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up suddenly. "Mebbe you'd like to sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">your ranch back. Heh?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">5' NOTING the look of cupidity in</seg><seg type="columnLine">, that foxy face, Carlton reversed</seg><seg type="columnLine">I the pistol and weighed the butt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand as if wondering how deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could crash into that mournful, drooling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked head. But he took it out in won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering. Finch seemed to keep the engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neer's temper just at the border-line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder, but Carlton couldn't cross the line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was angered, perplexed and baffled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At length, to save his own sanity, he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">it up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you walk?" he snarled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I might make it," said Finch, screw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up his face dubiously. "My hoss is</seg><seg type="columnLine">right yonder on t'other side of that brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your getaway was well arranged," ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served Carlton dryly. "Do you murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">many people in this way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You pizened them hosses," reiterated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch in the same regretful voice. "I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right sorry abaout it, but-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up!" screamed Carlton. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">say one more word, and I'll blow your head</seg><seg type="columnLine">off!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hypnotized though he was by that soft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighing voice, an overdose of it broke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell, and, now that he had cast off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbing influence, he resolved to keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper hand. He knew he was just im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsive enough to make good his threat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sought an excuse. He longed for an excuse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it never came. And then Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered what to do with the man. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't shoot him in cold blood. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't kick a wounded man down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill. He couldn't keep him on the hilltop</seg><seg type="columnLine">all night, and he couldn't take him home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a more civilized land he might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch arrested, but that seemed out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound it!* puzzled the engineer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finch seemed about to speak. Carlton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face showed a queer smile. Finch sensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was very near to eternity. He clamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jaw and looked away. Carlton teetered</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his toes and then made his decision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand up and hop!" ordered the engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finch uncoiled his lanky frame and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopped. Carlton helped him toward a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse that whinnied from the shadow of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">8	Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot granite pillar, and half-shoved, half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked him into the saddle, while Finch</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelped with pain. When the job was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted, Carlton, who had put the pistol into</seg><seg type="columnLine">its holster, produced it again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Travel!" he ordered sternly. "Git!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vamose! And if you ever start anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me again, I'll shoot on sight! Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanish!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finch shook his doleful head, gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reins, clucked dismally and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the rocky hillside toward the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley below. Carlton stood and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the figure was far down into the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaches. A dozen clever and snappy re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks came to his head now, and yet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch's reproachful and nonresistant pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence he knew his brain had bogged down as</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual--and now he had let the cold-blooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">old assassin go! The thought made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry with himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned his face away from the pitiless</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare of the setting sun and looked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eastern side of the ridge into his little</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden of Eden. The western country</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gaunt and godless, gray and yellow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing in the blur of the purple heat-wave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The valley was different. Pines clustered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in cool little groves under the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">copper mountain, and their tiny springs</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave verdure to the ground immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far away the ranch-house and bams</seg><seg type="columnLine">and coops of Ebenezer Finch stood like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to^ placed on a carpet of green, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow haystacks here and there and peace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful animals grazing. But somehow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer lands at the lower end of the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked yellower, as if lacking something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A little verdant spot stood alongside</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton's tiny white house, almost beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but that was from a trickling spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">used mostly for drinking-water. He con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">templated the place for a long time; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No water, little money and no friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">except one rip-snorting old saloon-keeper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What am I going to do?" he asked of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast silence that seemed to mock him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the treeless west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked downward to the gaunt foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills and their mystic purple ravines and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulches, spread before him for miles, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospitable and inscrutable, as if enchanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by demons. This was the unmerciful</seg><seg type="columnLine">world outside the gates of his home, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fate seemed to be driving him toward it</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could not leave the country for good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew his disease, even though he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquering it The doctors had specified</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert for him. and the desert it must be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only a question of happiness in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley of liis dreams or unhappiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the treeless, waterless plains below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Standing on the mountain-top and looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sinister western lands, tlie engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw liis problem as plainly as if it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">written in two words: yes or no.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" he resolved. "Never! If 1 have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to. I'll kill him! Thi^ is my home, and mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">she'll stay!''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a new swing to Carlton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders a&gt; he ambled down the mountain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side later. He trudged toward the low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands and past a detached grove of pines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistling in spite of the heat The shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ows of late afternoon were dimming the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight, and soon the air would l)e cooler.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Supper seemed to lje ready in the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-painted, two-story cottage. A wisp</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke curled from its chimney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the man noticed a flash of blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">and white coming around the corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and running toward him. The figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed agitated. Slightly alarmed, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained speed until he vaulted the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence that bounded his truck-garden, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brown-eyed wife met him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Harry!" she cried, clutching at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know. What is it? The horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">galloped in a long time ago with an empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle!" She was almost breathless, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes showed the strain she had under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. "I thought of all sorts of horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. Then Finch rode by with his leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound up. I called, but he wouldn't stop;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I stopped him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her eyes snapped sternly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I took down that rifle over the mantel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pointed it at him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great Scott! What did he do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, he grinned like an old wolf and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put up his hands. He said. 'You're larnin',</seg><seg type="columnLine">ma'am,' and I said he would, too. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. 'Birds of a feather flock together' and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled. I'd forgotten to cock the ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer of the rifle; so I pulled it back with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumb. The gun nearly went off. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful!" She took a long, shuddering</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. "I asked him where you were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he said he didn't know. He seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">more polite. May be that clicking sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">4</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss of Mirage	,	9</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it. He insisted he hadn't seen you;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so at last 1 had to let him go. He just left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then 1 really became worried.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer's brows were furrowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What a liar he is!" he exclaimed irri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tably. "It's like--like coping with an eeL</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did he say anything else--make any</seg><seg type="columnLine">threats?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "N-no." She seemed hesitant, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">loath to alarm him. "He said something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about 'widow's weeds,' but I didn't quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch it. Nothing else much. His talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be rambling. He said his best</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse died last night and a friend named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Black was coming over to 'dicker' about</seg><seg type="columnLine">some land. He said Black had advised</seg><seg type="columnLine">him not to sell you the ranch but he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance on you and now he's sorry. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">about ail, I guess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All?" gasped Carlton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The news made him wonder if the odds</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him were not too great. Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a reputation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE man belonged to the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">oldest profession in the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Back in the shadowy ages of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiquity the kings of a legendary Egypt</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed his predecessors to do their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidding. Cambyses, Claudius and Nero</seg><seg type="columnLine">used them lavishly. The Byzantine em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perors posted them on every street corner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the age of the Borgias lifted their</seg><seg type="columnLine">craftsmanship almost into the arts. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">there they slowly declined in numbers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">power until today they are found only in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the toughest wards of the big cities or on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last frontiers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Silent Jim" Black was a professional</seg><seg type="columnLine">killer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This rough-and-ready section of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country whispered about Black but could</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove nothing. He never harmed any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">except in self-defense, cleverly arranged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was not a fire-eater. It was not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">proven that he could be hired to kill. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only apparent that often, when two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men got into a quarrel, one of them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to run against Jim Black. After the ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">funeral Black seemed a mite more pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perous, but that might be coincidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer's wife felt there was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing wrong. She read it in her husband's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter?" she asked. "Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black a dangerous man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton played the game and put his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her. He had no intention of causing</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm. Things were bad enough as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, no," he reassured her. "Black is</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the most suave and courteous per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons in the country'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what is he doing with Finch?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know. Maybe I'll find out,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he replied with hidden sarcasm. "Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind that. Let's get supper."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wife sensed there was some cruel</seg><seg type="columnLine">play going on around her, but her Eastern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained mind could not gage it. Later, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the days passed, the mystery' became a</seg><seg type="columnLine">torment, equal to the question of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisoned horses. Her husband daily</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed more nervous and worried. Once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Finch happened by, Carlton hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside and stood by his rifle. Again, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch and a black-clad stranger rode about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the former's ranch, the engineer lay under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pine tree and with field-glasses watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">them until the tour was over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, when the dark stranger rode by</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone and tossed a casual nod toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, Carlton's face went white, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept his hand near a holster behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway. When Jim Black failed to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest hostile sign, the engineer felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a fool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That episode made things worse. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">times Carlton wondered if he were not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mite too scary. The engineer did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to think; so he puzzled and worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">until at length the strain and irritation</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to tell on him. Then his wife caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the infection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To cap the climax, Ebenezer Finch began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to resume his visits when Carlton w^as too</seg><seg type="columnLine">far afield to forestall him. First he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to "borry" something, just as if nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened. Later he called to bewail</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loss of a prime w'hite mare and twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">mules by poison. The visits kept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young woman exasperated and nervous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she felt that was what he aimed for.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It looked like part of his campaign of terror-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ism. She sensed that his evasive, whining,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiseacre speech covered something sinister</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that he was watching, watching like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiled snake biding its time to strike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't stand it any longer!" she blurted</seg><seg type="columnLine">one October evening when she and Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">were seated on the steps of their narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">little porch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know," nodded the engineer, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed at his forbidden pipe and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">IO</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fading sunlight weave its red brocades</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the copper mountain. "Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">can I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And yet," she hesitated, "it's glorious."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She sniffed the cooling October air, scented</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the pines and the dry grass and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">near-by rose-bushes. "Finch offered eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred dollars for the land," she con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded paradoxically. "Then he offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It cost us eight thousand," he stated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Would you like to give it up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. And yet--can we stay?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took the pipe from his mouth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be watching a humming-bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it studied a new honeysuckle vine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe not," he admitted. "If it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't for the confounded mysteries, maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could. Who's been poisoning those</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps they were not poisoned at all."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They were! I've seen the dead ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, then they were" she sighed. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">give it up. What can we do about it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've got a plan. I've been thinking it</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. We'll go to town for a while. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">come and farm the place at odd times and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hire a few huskies to relieve me in guarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">it." The engineer was really contemplating</seg><seg type="columnLine">an offensive wrar, but of this he said nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"In that way," he explained, "we can run</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranch and get away from this mystery."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"For how long? Have we money</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess so. Maybe I can do a little land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surveying outside. Anyhow, the change</seg><seg type="columnLine">will do us good. How about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> •"But how can we leave with Finch</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's easy. We'll get things packed</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly and wait till he starts out some</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning for supplies. He'll leave Abe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bilger, that half-witted hired man of his,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to guard the place. We'll let him get well</seg><seg type="columnLine">started, and then wTe'll follow on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They discussed it all evening, measuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">things from every angle, but they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided beforehand. They had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize that their single-handed battle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little too much for them at present.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They needed a respite. Thus it happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">that next day the wife got things in order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then they awaited the passing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch. Black had disappeared from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene and almost from their minds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two weeks later Finch went by with</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty saddle-bags and grain-sacks dangling</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his horse's sides. He saw' the glint of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton's ready gun and kept at a respectful</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance. AJter he left the valley, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer cautiously mounted the ridge to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make sure it was not some ruse, but Finch</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept on, past cliffs and foot-hills, till at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length his dust faded in the far white dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance of the alkaline plains. Then Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended to his home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's after nine o'clock," he announced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let's hurry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They took two saddle-horses and a pack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inule, loading them carefully. They did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not want their departure to appear per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manent. Then, with everything ready,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they trotted down the little lane and toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pass that led out of their valley of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once, at the gap, they halted for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and the wife looked back, wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it were for the last time. The gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">October sunlight glorified fields, pine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">groves, oaks and w-iilows, and the cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze brought the gracious scent of pine</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their nostrils, while the old copper moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain gave them benediction from above.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A meadow-lark sang them a little song. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">bee hummed by. The girl's eyes moistened</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a queer homesickness, but she turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">her horse resolutely and started onward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">in</seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY arrived at the settlement</seg><seg type="columnLine">before dusk, meeting only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattlemen or prospectors on the way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton took his wife to the ramshackle</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel for the time and then sw'ung past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seven saloons of the "street" to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the porch of Dolan's dance-hall and general</seg><seg type="columnLine">merchandise store jutted into a turn of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A pianist was practising for the evening's</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise, and the quavery banging floated out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many windows, past the dozen loungers</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatted on the wide porch or leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">against hitching-posts as they performed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their evening (ask of watching the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive. Inside another dozen was gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the bar near the wide door. Dolan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy bass voice floated out, giving direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions about trimming the lamps. WTien</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton ambled in, Dolan, in shirt-sleeves</seg><seg type="columnLine">as usual, dropped a rag and grabbed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well!" he roared. "You still on earth?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss of Mirage</seg><seg type="columnLine">How goes it?" He pulled Carlton forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he were a doll. "Come back to a table</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have a drink. Not drinkin' today,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hey? Well, have a drink anyhow!" And</seg><seg type="columnLine">with great gusto he yanked the engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward a seat near a window in the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, while the hangers-on laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolan's attitude changed when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton seated in the corner. He muffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice somew'hat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You darned fool!" he rasped. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you come here for?" -</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why? What's the matter?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Matter? Huh--if Jim Black sees you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">good night! He's after you!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The engineer felt his heart thump</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange])-. He pondered a moment; then:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why should he be seeking me now?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He needs money. He gits it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fitch--provided. See?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Provided!" gulped Carlton. "Provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">he does the work, that is. I see." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and tried to figure it all out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then, if I go, Black gets the ranch. I see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's about what Finch hinted one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he met my wife."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then he lied as usual," contradicted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh. Think Finch wants Black for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a neighbor? Nix. Not. Ncin! Too dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous! Black gits cash!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The more Carlton studied the transaction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the less natural it seemed. That sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">business might be all right for the old Lhugs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of India or the mandarins of China, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of paid assassination in the civilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">year of 1903 in the State of California</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed like a strain on the imagination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though Dolan's bailiwick w'as in the wildest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most lawless section of a go-as-you-</seg><seg type="columnLine">please county, it took only three days to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the railroad, and then the big modem</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities were in easy reach. Even here</seg><seg type="columnLine">their influence was felt. Dolan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of installing a telephone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's nonsense!" blurted the engineer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's a plot to scare me out!1'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton looked at the saloon-keeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">queerly for an instant. Dolan had tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to alarm him. Might it be--could it be--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Dolan was also in the plot? Anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed possible. Did this saloon-keeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">size him up for a tenderfoot after all--just</seg><seg type="columnLine">another "sucker" to be trimmed? Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not naturally suspicious, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not wholly well yet, and of late he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been filled with many perplexities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, it's a plot," said Dolan tiredly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If they skeer you out, so much the better.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If not, you git out anyhow. See? That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Black comes in. Finch means busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. You hit him with a rail. His hosses</seg><seg type="columnLine">are pizened. You shot hira, I hear. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad. Before that it wasn't personal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You was only another sucker. Now it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers'nal. See?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," argued Carlton, "Black was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley several times. He didn't start any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should he? No witnesses there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He couldn't prove self-defense. Your wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">was always around. It has to be public.</seg><seg type="columnLine">See?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer found his throat welling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his lingers drumming on the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously. The lamps of the dance-hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being hung, but he only saw them as</seg><seg type="columnLine">glassy blurs. He knew his face was white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was able to meet Dolan's shrewd</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze unflinchingly. There wras even de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiance in his eyes. The big man nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are--are you sure of all this?" insisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the groping Carlton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certain. Finch came in several weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago. Drank too much of Looey Bums'</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake-juice." Dolan jerked his finger in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of a rival sin-palace. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Looey about his friend Black. Said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black wras likely to git somebody soon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Said it was all fixed. Said thereVI be one</seg><seg type="columnLine">less pest in Lost Deet Valley- That meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Then he went to sleep under a table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forgot all about it. Looev told me next</seg><seg type="columnLine">evenin'. Perfesh'nul courtesy between sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loon-owners. Yes, I said courtesy. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to keep, tabs on people. A man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">credit may be no good. If he hangs around</seg><seg type="columnLine">too long, he'll bust you. It's business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton began to see into things he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never dreamed of. He had stumbled upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a regular, coordinated information-bureau!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then who has been poisoning Finch's</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," admitted Dolan. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">got my suspicions, but I ain't sure yet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why the devil didn't you stay away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gimme time to w-ork things "out?" The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss scratched his head. "Now Finch is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in town. Black's here. You're here. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all mixed up. The devil only knows how</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's cornin' out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," announced Carlton, "I'm not</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to run, anyhow."</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No; only, lay low. No use to look for</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. Black's deadly. Lay low'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this kindly admonition the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to get up and go about his business,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but something in Carlton's face arrested</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The engineer, two shades paler, w'as</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at something far past the boss.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan turned and peered around.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND the loafers at the bar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the wide doorway, beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hitching-posts and the dusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">roadway, tlie dark, immaculate figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Black was seen passing a small knot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men and ambling toward Dolan's door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stopped and nodded to some one; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sauntered onward. Carlton had hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chair and was staring as if fascinated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lay low!" advised Dolan. "Sit tight!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It might not come now anyhow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Carlton's jaw was set at last, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to arise. He had come to the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the road. The long siege of w'orry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt and fear and nervous tension had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused something to snap within him, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though his teeth were chattering, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast the die. He was afraid--scared blue--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but going forward. The eyes of the tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">old boss showed an admiring glint, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolved to save this man from the results</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own stubborn courage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down!" ordered Dolan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I won't!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will!" snapped the boss, laying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty hand on his shoulder. "Nix on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this hero stuff! Lay low!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton's eyes were suddenly hard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let go of me!" he demanded. "Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of my way!"	*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss hesitated only for an instant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he grabbed the engineers right arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twisted it as if in a vise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't speak to me like that!" he snarled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who do you think you are? Come on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you! You're goin' into that linen-closet!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he grabbed Carl ton by the scruff of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" exploded the outraged engineer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">savagely angry at last. "Why, you -"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up!" roared the saloon-keeper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the crowd outside the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">door jumped. They scattered pell-mell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two men, in the semigloom, rushed around</seg><seg type="columnLine">an outside corner and cowered behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'all of the building. Another yelled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">got behind a hitching-post. Sudden shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the scuffle of feet told of an instan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneous crisis outside. People were rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to get out of line from something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan knew the symptoms and halted, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A pistol cracked outside the window that</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced the side road. A piercing cry was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard--then another shot. Then silence--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the queer, deathly silence that follows a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bystanders started running forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the saloon. Dolan rushed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side window', drawing Carlton with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boss peered out to the roadway. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of an old blacksmith-shop opposite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prone figure was King, face forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiUi arms outstretched grotesquely. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other figure was sitting near by, sagging</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and nursing a shoulder. Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">came running up from every direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's done!" grunted Dolan, releasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engineer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old boss pointed a pudgy finger to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the prone figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Know who that is?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The engineer looked closer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's Ebenezer Finch!" he cried, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbelieving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right. Finch it is. Died game, any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how. He shot back. Cornered, I guess.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had to be game. Know the other feller?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bewildered engineer looked long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard. He had seen that middle-sized fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure somew'here but couldn't quite place</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's Tom Fulton," announced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fulton. Fulton? You mean the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">that used to own my ranch? Never met</seg><seg type="columnLine">liim. And yet he seems familiar, at that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim Black w'as lifting the suffering man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Black w'as an afterthought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure you seen Fulton!" boomed Dolan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "Remember the day you was here</seg><seg type="columnLine">last? 'Member the coot that came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of licker? Wanted to lick all creation?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Got thrown out? That wras Fulton."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton began to grope. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something underneath it all, but he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not grasp it. Dolan suddenly appeared as</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied as a cat full of cream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''This here tragedy cost me about twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars," announced the big saloon-keeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite casually.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton became even more befuddled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twenty? How?" he asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss of Mirage</seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keepin' Fulton full of Dutch courage,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied the amiable old thug. "He used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to own your ranch. Got froze out like you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woke up too late. Swore he'd kill Finch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Didn't make good. Got sick, went broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drifted away. I forgot all about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He ' didn't. Came back here after five</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. Worked up his courage with licker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tried to git himself up to the killin'-point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Got too noisy, and I threw him out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you reminded me who he was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You told me who'd owned your ranch</seg><seg type="columnLine">before you. You mentioned Tom Fulton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I knew him. After you left, I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him. I sort of have it in for Finch</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. Fulton told me all his troubles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Got sympathy. Also licker. Buckets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Got more courage every day&lt; Waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Finch. Finch arrived today. Funeral</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow."</seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS terse and to the point, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton felt his hair curling. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad-shouldered, black-haired giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of him had arranged a killing</seg><seg type="columnLine">as casually as he would prepare a fishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">excursion. He even furnished the bait!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The engineer found himself dizzy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old boss read his thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For the public good," he grunted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Finch was a pest. Always in trouble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Always snivelin'. Always cheatin'. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been waitin' for some one to put him out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now I'm glad he's gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So was Carlton, in a way, but his soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not yet risen to such heights of altruis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic manslaughter, and the chills were running</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his spine. He was brave enough, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was different He changed the subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then maybe Fulton poisoned those</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses," he surmised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mebbe. He went away mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">several times. He promised to do some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin' desp'rate. That's about his size--</seg><seg type="columnLine">pizenin' dumb animals. Mebbe, if I wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof, I could git it, but--what's the use?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't care a hoot either way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a wealth of scorn in Dolan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice in commenting upon his tool, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engineer realized how masterfully the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunkard had been managed. While 'Carl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton was away in his valley, a little drama</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been staged in this rough pine-board</seg><seg type="columnLine">colony, with John Barleycorn as a prime</seg><seg type="columnLine">actor and himself as beneficiary--and Do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lan as stage-manager. Carlton realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the big boss had mainly told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth. He had supplied the shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he despised Finch naturally, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the general public good, because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to see a fight and partially because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Carlton. Then another thought crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engineer's mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the way," he asked, "how about Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black? What is he going to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolan's reply was prompt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothin'. Why should he? Finch is</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead. The deal's off. This shootin' leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black up in the air. Nothin' in it for him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is there? He's got nothin' against you</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal, has he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It sounds reasonable," conceded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here in the dusk, with the last faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">traces of red in the western sky, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a great burden was lifted off his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, even though he did not exactly ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove of the method. He felt that his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed clear from now on and he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">live forever with his bride in the valley of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart's delight, with the old copper</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain giving them benediction to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. With his heart swelling, the engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned away from the wrinkled face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sordid, crafty, loyal old thug who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">befriended him. He absently looked out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side to where groups of men stood about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the actors in the pitiful tragedy. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dreams vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd in front of Finch had thinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly, and the glimmer of a lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed his head being raised on Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black's knee while another man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponging his hair, where a dark stream was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowing from above the ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finch's face was almost demoniac as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern cast its lights and shadows upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp features, and from his mouth there</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued a volley of profanity that seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicker the light with its blasts. Nearer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">another group was putting Tom Fulton on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shutter, lifting him with rough tenderness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond the groups of men, lights from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Looey's place and the other saloons down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street gave vague illumination to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roadway, while the music of a tinny piano</seg><seg type="columnLine">jangled from one of them, playing a "coon</seg><seg type="columnLine">song' as if nothing had "happened. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">above all came that high-pitched jabber</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ebenezer Finch, very much alive. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not soft and regretful now; it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive. Among other thing's it shrieked</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gimme my gun!'' and "Lemme at him!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No!" came Uie voice of Jim Black dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a silence. "Stop that! Wait till you</seg><seg type="columnLine">get 'tended to!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A murmur of voices followed, broken by</seg><seg type="columnLine">another shrieking volley of wildcat profanity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the writhing form of the wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Fulton had been carried out of sight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Finch had not seen him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton, noting with interest tfiat Finch</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken on another i'eud, felt queerly like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a front-seat spectator in a show arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his benefit as he looked out of the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow. Dolan, standing alongside him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed angry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-!" boomed the heavy voice of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss at length in infinite disgust. "Rotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">job! Rotten!" And that was all he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A prospector came through the talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd at Dolan's doorway and approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boss, bringing news.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didja see it?" he chirped. "A fella</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Fulton met old Finch in the road-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way and cussed him out. He 'peared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk. He reached for his gun, an' so did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch. Finch shot him in the shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' he shot Finch in the head. They was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so close they jest couldn't miss!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh. What was the trouble?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan innocently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The prospector's face looked perplexed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">trDarned if I know'," he answered. "Mebbe</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's some one that Finch skinned."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How?" asked the boss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," answered the puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospector. "Somethin' was said about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch, but that was all I got."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The desert-rat seemed aggrieved about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a long, lonely trip through unlimited</seg><seg type="columnLine">wastes, where he and his burro had probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered all sorts of hardships, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnessed a bang-up fight and didn't un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand all about the matter, thus feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">deprived of something. He did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fulton. Few did. The male population</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted in and out continually--and five</seg><seg type="columnLine">years is a long time. Men did not generally</seg><seg type="columnLine">know each other very well in this country'. '</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Is Finch hurt bad?" asked the boss."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dunno. Somebody went after Doc</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davis, and mebbe we'll see. There's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old doc now." And the prospector ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to keep tab on the latest develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A stocky man with a warty face and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulbous nose ambled gravely toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recumbent Finch. The crowd made way</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him as, with gestures of professional</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest, the elderly arrival examined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound and gave a few terse directions to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bystanders. Dan Dolan chuckled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all right now. Doc Davis has got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case. Finch'll die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer looked nonplussed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hoss-doctor," explained Dolan. "Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">man once, but went wrong. Came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York. Had troubles. Drowned 'em.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Been drownin' 'em ever since. If Finch is</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt bad, he'll die."</seg><seg type="columnLine">SOMEHOW Carlton could not fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">into this mood. Dolan might hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that, but the engineer couldn'L</seg><seg type="columnLine">The engineer failed to realize that Dolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked on Finch as one might look on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake or any other pest which one did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate but simply struck on general principles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without realizing it fully, Dolan, busy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">engrossing business and political" fights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had despised the old hypocrite for years but</seg><seg type="columnLine">never thought much about it until a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">he liked became a victim. Now he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking notice with a vengeance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If Davis is loaded enough, he'll operate,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">added the boss. "That's him. If he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sober, he lets the patient alone. Patient</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovers. If he's full, he wants to show off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tackles anything. He'd operate on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angel Gabriel!" And Dolan's calculating</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze went to the bottles stacked behind his</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't!" advised Carlton. "Isn't there</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other doctor around here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolan looked a little disappointed at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeamishness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nope," he replied tersely. "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">three at the county-seat. None here but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davis. No use to bring in another doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch ain't worth it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer felt properly rebuked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," he decided cautiously, "anyhow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe it's best to be neutral Let 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. Let Davis kill or cure. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes it a sporting proposition."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton calculated that the sporting ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment would appeal to Dolan, and it did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fair enough," acceded the boss. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">bet you ten he dies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Done!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A glance through the window showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Finch had been carried somewhere out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight. The side street was deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss of Mirage</seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg><seg type="columnLine">again except for its tethered horses and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jangle of piano music. It was just as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing had happened. Dolan and Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambled toward the front of the place, get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting out of the way for the dance about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">start. A few tired-looking girls had ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared long before and mingled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd of prospectors, miners, ranchers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattlemen from every part of the hills. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">piano, a fiddle and a bass-drum had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuning up. The board walls were beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rattle at the noise, and pictures of ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tresses, culled from the sporting journals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were vibrating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The portly Doctor Davis came in at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, strutting importantly at the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a retinue. Dolan's practised eye estimated</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was half-sober, wliile those at the bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied the medical man with questions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All he needs is a little time and nursing,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced the professional man. , ''The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet struck the temporal bone, went along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screamous portion, glanced off the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">peetreus tracts and avoided the mastoid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a welt, a track or what might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">called a crease. Except for possible con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussion, gen'lemen, I doubt that any ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial complications can occur. He is rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing easy at the hotel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed Hendry, from the Willow Creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, leaned his tall frame against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar and voiced his curiosity loudl)'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What made him yell like a wildcat when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Delirum," responded the doctor courte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously. "Perfectly natural. Any one gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted around after a blow like that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, one-half an inch more and he'd have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been dead!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Huh. That's the first time Finch ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">let himself out!*' commented the rancher.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He usu'lly snivels. Did he git over it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's calmed down now," admitted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor. "Friend of yours?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" snapped Hendry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah," said the horse-doctor, changing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject tactfully. "Bartender, set 'em up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your pleasure, gen'lemen, every one!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Dan Dolan was loyal to his bet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No!" he countermanded. "No drinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the doc! Everybody but the doctor!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crowd turned. The insulted veter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inarian sputtered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No drinks till Finch is out of danger!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hendry, the Willow Creek rancher,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned around and faced Dolan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is Finch a friend of yours?" he inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed very quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss bristled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's it to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rancher's face whitened, but he faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan without flinching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you're through!" he flared. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew Finch in Escalante. If you're a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend of his, you're a low-down, sneakin',</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyin', hoss-stealin' skunk that a decent</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattlesnake wouldn't be seen in company</seg><seg type="columnLine">with! Why, you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss could not hesitate before an</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience like this. It was a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prestige, decided instantly. The mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist of Dan Dolan crashed into Hendry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and whirled him backward into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse-doctor. The smack sounded like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ax hitting a tree. The rancher and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mcdical man rolled to the sawdust together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd parted as if by magic. Dolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood alone, fist clenched, facing the prone</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Two other Willow Creek men sidled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, facing Dolan wrathfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Want some, too?" roared the boss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of them grabbed his arm. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not argue. He shoved the man aside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other reached downward toward his</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt. Quick as light, the giant rushed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and planted a pole-ax blow into his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That man also fell to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some one yelled. The place became tu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">multuous. Carlton edged toward the boss</seg><seg type="columnLine">loyally, but Dolan needed no help. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped over quickly and disarmed the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had reached downward. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up with a gleaming six-shooter in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any one else want in?" he roared, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around truculently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one volunteered. Some of the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">even drew back. The boss, satisfied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked over to the first man he had struck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed Hendry of Willow Creek was just com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to. The horse-doctor was fanning him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here!" said the boss, pulling Hendry to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet "Git out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led the unresisting man to the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave him a gentle shove. Then he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and picked up the second victim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook him a bit and helped him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door also. It had all happened within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right!" cried the boss, waving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to the crowd in the dance-halL</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Track's clear! On with the dance! Strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the music!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">i6</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The "music" obeyed with great alacrity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton had been a silent bystander, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a way he wondered what this giant might</seg><seg type="columnLine">do next. When the boss approached, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a thundering black mood. His first</seg><seg type="columnLine">remark was wrathful but utterly unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected.	m ^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now I'm ag'in Finch for fair!" he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced, "'Tain't your light alone now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's mine!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton was thunderstruck at this atti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How?" he blurted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh. Finch started all Lhe trouble in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first place, didn't he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, now he's lost me three good cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomers!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    HARRY CARLTON did not sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">very well that night. His experien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ -* ces had brought him into a depres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive mood. It was not that he had lost out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not that he lacked loyal backing. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was because of his environment and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sordidness of it and a species of homesick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness that had come over him. Carlton did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not feel above his fellows, but they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">different so that the roughness and harsh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of this land and its people made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder if it were worth while to continue</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them, even though his conquered</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease demanded it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The town was a hole-in-the-mud place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The highest ideal of most of its inhabitants</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to win enough money at gambling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep cold drunk. The town was called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mirage. Apt name! It was illusory, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stable, unreliable. A1 though it had lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty years, it still had the unpainted, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kempt appearance of a camp that might</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow away any minute and was not worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">improving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Carlton was most worried about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife. Now that he had her in town, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">could he do with her? For the present they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken quarters at the hotel, made from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a defunct dance-hall, where thin board*</seg><seg type="columnLine">partitions had been nailed to make "rooms."</seg><seg type="columnLine">For her there were no women to associate</seg><seg type="columnLine">with, no amusement, no little conveniences.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hotel was used mainly by drunks</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping off their sprees. The place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sordid and makeshift and depressing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole atmosphere of the town, for a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Eastern girl, was impossible--im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hi the sunlight of the next day it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">even worse. The signs on the cheap board</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronts of the cheap board saloons and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese restaurant and the old red black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">smith shop were half obliterated by the hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">suns of forty years. Dolan's place, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the windows unwashed and fly-specked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked dilapidated and sodden and cheer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. Beyond the turn of the road at Do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lan's the hot, treeless spurs of gaunt moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains sloped down into unlimited wastes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot, treeless, waterless plains that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stretch on forever. Carlton began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">curse the folly and the illusions that brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into this country'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although the engineer did not know it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was suffering the maladies that come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">every secondary pioneer. The first pioneers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to this land and given their</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural wildness full sway, turning it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a free-for-all hell and ignoring its possibili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties. Had Carlton understood, he might,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the far-seeing Dolan, have visioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself clearly as among the first of the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">pioneers in this corner of the county--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest, decent settlers who within ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">years were to transform the old West into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new West and make it a land of pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perous homes, schools, auto roads, giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">irrigation systems and clean little towns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton could not peer ahead and see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great dam with which the Government was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to impound waters far in the mountains so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this desert would be forever blessed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As an engineer he knew the possibilities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country- in a vague way, but reality lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the future. He did not even fully realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the rest of the county was slowly com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from its long sleep and that only in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">section was the last frontier. He only</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he was disgusted and incredibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely. He had not been so in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley. That was his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can't stand much of this," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced to his wife in the morning, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the bare board walls of his room</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the partitions echoed snores from</seg><seg type="columnLine">other boudoirs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why not? With nothing to do, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to go, no one to talk to? I ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thought of that before we came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, it'll kill you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you're here, aren't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was simply said, but it made Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss of Mirage</seg><seg type="columnLine">17</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingle. The doubts and depressions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept away instantly as if banished by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairy hand. The knowledge that he pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed this beautiful girl made him realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, even though perplexities sprang up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">every side, his game was worth playing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then immediately another distraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his brows wrinkle. How long could</seg><seg type="columnLine">this beautiful young wife go about such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a place without complications starting?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton knew the general chivalry of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">West, but he also knew the free-and-easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude of men accustomed to dance-hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls and the less free-and-easy ideas of</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain others who were not accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">being balked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first complication along these lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">came late in the afternoon, when Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to the hotel after looking over some</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who might assist him to hold his little</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley. His wife was seated on the ve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">randa, and alongside her was the quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-mannered Jim Black!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Black arose courteously when the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gineer arrived, and the engineer seated him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, feeling that Black was just a bit enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prising.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Black has just been telling me about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anam and Hue," explained the wife, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anam and Hue and Bangkok and Singa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pore and a lot of other places. Mr. Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been all over the Orient!" She said it</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if she had made a find.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer's eyes narrowed. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">from many instances how the East Coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">blunts the morals of all but the strongest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and he began to appraise Black better.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black was a Westerner, all right, but he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not fit into this settlement. He belonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some seaport town like San Francisco or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seattle. Yet he had been here for a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. What was the answer? What was</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hiding from?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Silent Jim had been talkative!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd like to hear of Mr. Black's travels--</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of them," said Carlton with malicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">courtesy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Black's cold gray eyes flashed sideways</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an instant, but his reply was peace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pleased to, some day," he replied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arising. "I'll have to move along now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Got to see a friend. Good day, Mrs. Carl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton; good day, Carlton!"

He changed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tactics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Know what a bobcat is?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly. "It's a lynx--a wildcat. Highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitable. Weil, if you want a real good</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, go get a nice lively one, bring it up</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to you and then ask it questions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's no more dangerous than fooling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Black, and you'll get just as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">information!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">DAN DOLAN, however, tried it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own way and got something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was not really hoping for infor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation, but anything that came into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">net was welcome. He and Black hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to get together two days after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton came to town, and they sat at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan's back-room table, where the boss</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun his webs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How's Finch gittin' along?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan casually, over a glass of beer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dunno," said Black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''They say he's got eary-sipilis," volun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teered the boss.

I own a half-interest in the hotel.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Black's eyes flickered at this barbarous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">commercialism, but still he said nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That noise must be hard on the Carlton</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gal," added the boss. "Darned shame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">No way to treat a lady like that. Fine gal,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ain't she?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Black nodded again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Worth havin'," remarked the boss,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looking crafty.

"Best-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lookin' Ally that ever come to town," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Black looked wearied. Dolan changed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the subject.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Think Finch may be all right soon?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Black sat back in his chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why do you ask me?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, I thought you was interested. Saw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you stand by him when he was shot.

"Fact is, I'm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tired of him. Wish he'd go fer keeps. He's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a pest. I'd help put up a purse to plant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him, jest for the public good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Black's gaze became direct and cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Not while I'm here!" he stated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The boss was taken aback. This man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Black was believed to be for hire, and yet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">here he turned down a bid! The boss knew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that Finch would not pay top prices for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any job. Dolan could easily beat Finch's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bid, and yet Black had turned him down--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cold!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why?" asked the boss bluntly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Friend of mine," snapped Black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How?" persisted Dolan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Helped me once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The boss looked curious. He knew that,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if Finch lived, Black would probably carry-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out his lethal contract against the engineer,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but here was an angle that was hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand. Dolan assumed his most in</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratia ting air and leaned forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Black looked half-defiant, but he let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words come to his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two years ago I was broke. Sister</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying in Chicago. Also broke. Only rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive 1 had. Best friend I ever had. Sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down and out. Pleaded for help. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went crazy. Got desperate. Started ouL</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a gun to collect. New game for me--</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't like hold-ups. Caught Finch on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road Got fifty dollars. 1 had a mask,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he rcc'nized me. I said I had 10 have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money. ^ He quit yelping and asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">me why. I told him. I'd have told any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one then. He said, 'Keep the fifty.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he took me to his ranch and gave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen hundred dollars."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss was staggered. Such a tale</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the crooked old miser of Lost Deer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valley was incredible!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It went to your sister?" gasped Dolan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She died happy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And Finch loaned it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. He gave it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE boss nearly fell over. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the old miser of Lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deer Valley giving fifteen hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars to any one was incredible--unthink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able! Black must l&gt;e lying. If not . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolan's eyes narrowed at a new thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was two years ago?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Black nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss lashed his memory for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">episodes of two years back. Black had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been present for three years. In the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">one he had acquired a big part of his repu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation. The boss remembered Black's</seg><seg type="columnLine">initial battle, staged right by the bar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this dance-hall. There were a few low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voiced sentences between Black and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattleman, then a quick reach for guns.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the lightning of Jim Black's pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">had struck, the cattleman was beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking forever. What it was all about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody ever knew. They only saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black had fired in legitimate self-defense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where delay would have been fatal. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then there were other episodes--several of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My fault," apologized the boss, mostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself. "I oughta kept better track</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tilings. "</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss of Mirage</seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course Finch had paid Black the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money! If Dolan were the most vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">old miser in the county and saw a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put under obligations a prize gunman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan might have done the same thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though the cost broke his heart. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bfl&amp;s was beginning to see into things he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never dreamed of before. He had known</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch casually, as he knew many others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that was all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wily old boss, however, knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">political line-ups in the county, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew of certain things that had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently in his vicinity. Certain episodes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instance, where men with property had</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished. He felt now that Black was</seg><seg type="columnLine">implicated in some of them. Also Finch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He put two and two together and made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggering total, but he was not sure yet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wished now that he had been less frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">in expressing enmity to Finch. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, if apparently neutral, he might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the boss had declared war; so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to "stand pat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got friends, too," said the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite frankly. "I'm a good deal like you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If anything happened to some of 'em, I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sorry. Darned sorry. Mebbe I'd grieve</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much and git excited. Then there'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">regrets all around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Black's gray eyes showed a flicker, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he arose quite easily and stretched himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the way it goes," he nodded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, I'll be going along. Got to see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend. So long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss understood, and so did Black.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The big man now realized that, if it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">just an ordinary squabble about that little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lost Deer Valley, things might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged with honor to both sides-- but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black had been elusive. It showed that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberate program of some sort was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond Dolan's doorway stood eighteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses and mules hitched to a great wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">that drew a trailer almost as large as itself--</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the many counterparts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"twenty-mule team" now advertised all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the country. Twenty mules were</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing remarkable here. This outfit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of Dolan's freight-teams that voyaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the dusty desert miles to the far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">away branch-line railroad, bringing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">merchandise and mails and taking out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">assorted products of small mines and a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered ranches. To this equipage Dolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon made his way, holding an envelope</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know Bill Campbell, down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the county-seat?" he asked the driver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The teamster rolled a quid of tobacco</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hair-hidden mouth and said he wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite sure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's a lawyer," said the boss. "Got an</seg><seg type="columnLine">office in that shanty across from the court-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. Tall feller. Good-lookin'. Light</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. Give him this. Savvy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeh," responded the teamster, indiffer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Paste it in your hat!" roared the boss.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That letter goes. See? Don't forgit</seg><seg type="columnLine">it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a land where ever}- one is a free citizen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandates do not go. A city delivery-man</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes orders. A desert freighter is likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wave a hand to the team and say, "Take</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em." A freighter is a high professional</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with a temperament like a grand-opera</seg><seg type="columnLine">prima-donna. He knows his own value.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This one looked at the boss speculatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment but decided at length to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accede to the request. Thus Caleb Snow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">teamster, pushed into the desert with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">missive in his hat. He started after noon</seg><seg type="columnLine">so as to reach by evening a certain water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole from which he could best start for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the journey. Dolan had a regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">schedule for his freight-teams.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE boss met Carlton the next day</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the general merchandise store,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Dolan generally put in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours supervising his sallow clerk, a waif</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had picked up from nowhere and tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">train into usefulness. The boss stood at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hardware counter while Mrs. Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspected some bolts .of cloth at the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">clry-goods nook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine gal," opened Dolan to Carlton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing with his thumb to the wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer agreed with a nod, wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing what was coming next.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How does she like it here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, so-so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lonely for her," admitted the boss.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How does she like Black?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not much. Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long before you can git back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley?" asked the boss, ignoring the other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About two days. As soon as Jerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin and Bob Arnold can get ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go with me. Why?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then take the wife along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton read a warning in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the idea?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jim Black. Been watchin' him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch'll prob'ly git well. Coin' to a hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pital down below, mebbe.

Anyhow, git her</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of town. If Black likes her, there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. If not, means trouble anyhow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mebbe Black might hang around a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">jest to start somethin'. Husband flies off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the handle, mebbe. Brings things to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">show-down. Savvy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh--rats! It sounds too far-fetched!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The eyes of the old boss narrowed under</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heavy brows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure!" he admitted. "Sounds Like melly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drammy. Only, let's suppose things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">S'pose you was an old crook. Used a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley to trap suckers. Trapped a lot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a sucker came along who wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">suck. Fought it out. Shot you in the leg.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hit you with a fence-rail. Watched you</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the time with field-glasses. And s'pose</seg><seg type="columnLine">you had a gunman obliged to you for favors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then what?" The boss concluded very</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, making each word tell, "And s'pose</seg><seg type="columnLine">you was doin' a lot of other queer business</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this young sucker was livin' a mite too</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great Scott!" said Carlton. "But what</seg><seg type="columnLine">is this 'other business'?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dunno. Mebbe I'll find out soon. Sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a letter down to the county-seat to a law-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You? Dealing with a lawyer?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yep. Gotta git information. I work</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Bill Campbell. On the quiet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm in bad with the county gang down</seg><seg type="columnLine">below."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "County gang?" *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. Office-holders. They don't like</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Sheriff came up here once to git a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. The man was innocent.

Deputy sheriffs came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They got kicked out, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton visualized the exciting picture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alone?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No; I had a few huskies with me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Held off the whole mob till we compermised.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They got the party they wanted.

They keep outa here. I keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">outa there. It works fine. More or less,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer was getting a real insight</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the old saloou-man's power. Here in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this last frontier, where the armed men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old West still flourished, Dan Dolan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge, jury and executioner. The laws^&gt;f</seg><seg type="columnLine">a county and a State were dispensed--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispensed with--according to agreements</seg><seg type="columnLine">made after a free-for-all fight! And yet it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed in keeping. It was as natural to</seg><seg type="columnLine">I his country^ as its sage-brush, its rattle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">snakes, its heat and its careless population.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh," commented the engineer, "it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be a line gang of politicians down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the county-seat!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine gang is right!" grunted the boss.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Cheap crooks. Held office too long.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Think they can git away with anything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some day they'll wake up! But they let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me alone. I'm not in on their deals; they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of mine. Peace rules--mebbe.

She opened her lips to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">something just as a husky, excited man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">corduroys and blue shirt came clattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, Dolan!" he bawled. "Heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No. What?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cale Snow, your Leamster, was shot dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Mesquite Springs!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">vn</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE boss slammed a fist on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter. In an instant his face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">red with wrath. The cords on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bull neck were swollen, while his eyes seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like lambent flames. The air seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged with electricity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who did il?" he thundered. "Tell me--</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss of Mirage</seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," said the informant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">''Bob Lange, he was ridin' by the springs</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Lange?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guess he's over at Toby's place.

The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clerk ducked his head again just as two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">men came through the front door together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">One was the informant, and the other was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a short, stocky, round-faced man with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bow legs of a seasoned rider. The boss</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemed to shoot a question straight into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his face:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lange, who shot Snow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "1 dunno."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where'd you find him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right alongside the spring.

This ap-*</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently referred to Snow's assistant. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one usually accompanies every desert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">freighter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "1 dunno. No trace of him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ran away! I oughta known it! White-</seg><seg type="columnLine">livered skunk! -me; if I ever see him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again he'll jun, all right! WTiere was the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">team?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right by the wagons, with feed-bags</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">still on 'em. The harness was off. My</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pardner's bringin' 'em in. We rode up to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the wells this morn in', and there was that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">team with nobody tendin' 'em. That</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looked queer; so I hollered. Somebody</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gurgled from the well--you know that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little spring under the mesquite--and so I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">went hootin' over there. Snow was lyin'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on his side, with red under his chest. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said 'Dolan.' Then he stopped. After</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I'd washed him some, he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'They come up behind me. Last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Two of 'em. In masks. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">made Jordan hop into the desert. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">they took away my money and a letter in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat.' That was about all. He had a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of red bandanna in his hand--here it is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From what I gather, they stopped and held</seg><seg type="columnLine">him up. Prob'ly they took his gun away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mebbe he had another under the wagon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat. He made a break for the wagon, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess, and then they tried to stop him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was signs of a struggle by the wheels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he must 'a' reached for the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow's gun and got plugged. He got</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the mask, though. See it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger handed over a piece of red</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandanna with an exaggerated fleur-de-lis</seg><seg type="columnLine">pattern, torn on two sides. The boss</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed it savagely with a queer expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion on his face. Carlton saw something</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coming and turned to his wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go back to the hotel!" he whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl looked curious but thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">best to accede.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss was in a storming rage by now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not notice her going. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice anything except that piece of red</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandanna. He looked at it closely, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a cruel smile came to his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Tom Yager?" he asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">informant suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Over at the hotel. Sleepin' off last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night's drunk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Axel Yager?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dunno.'' The informant's eyes turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the other jnan. "Wasn't he over</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Looey Bums'?" he asked. "Seems like</seg><seg type="columnLine">I seen him a short time ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeh," said the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go over and git him!'' ordered Dolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Lange, the short man. "Tell him I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to see liim about them samples from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his minin' claim."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The messenger was apparently a trusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend of Dolans and ran out willingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boss started pacing up and down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aisle again like an angry lion, shaking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaggy head and clenching his great fists.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton kept out of his wav.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a time the messenger returned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">another man--a gangling, stoop-shouldered</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert-rat with shifty blue eyes and faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">overalls hanging by one sweaty gallus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan seemed to control himself instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the newcomer entered. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a set smile on the boss's face, and he almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">purred. The other men got away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, looking nervous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Lo, Yager," greeted Dolan. "Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you been lately? Ain't seen you much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other answered laconically, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side-shifting eyes showed he was ill at ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Been up to the mine lately?" purred the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeh. A few days ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where was you yesterday? Wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, I was around town. Over at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Looey's, mostly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where was you last night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came like a whip-lash. The man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes shifted again, and he seemed non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plused. He was not quick-witted. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there like an oaf, sensing that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was wrong but not knowing just how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You was at Mesquite Springs!" thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered the boss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton caught his breath. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned white. He put up his hands as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fend off something. His jaw drooped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes twitched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss sprang forward like a tiger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got you now!" he snarled. "Thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd git away with it. With me? With</seg><seg type="columnLine">me? Huh!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">DOLAN'S mighty left arm grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of the man's neck. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand reached forward. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscled fingers clutched the throat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted the screeching man off the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flinging him backward pn to the counter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a thud and a squeal. The man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were popping from their sockets, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face was distorted inhumanly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who told you to do it?" bellowed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a gurgle from the wide mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sounded like a stifled shriek. Dolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran a linger along the throat, under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man squirmed sicldshly and flailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his long legs in every direction. Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned away, wondering what to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who told you to kill Snow?" roared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss. "Quick! You've only got a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton couldn't stand it any longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Don't!" he shouted. "Man alive--</seg><seg type="columnLine">don'tl"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dared the ferocious WTath of the boss</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laid a hand on the muscled shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to pull it away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up!'' roared Dolan, turning his</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage eyes on the engineer. "Git out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way--quick!'' And with one heave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those powerful shoulders he shoved Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the aisle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the boss looked dowTi upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim again. This time his voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very soft and smooth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me before I strangle you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Black!" gasped the suffering man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss bared his white teeth in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'ollish smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jim Black!'' he snarled. "I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">so! What for? What did he want? Quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">--answer!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Money!" choked the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss ran his finger under the jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. The other screeched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A letter! A letter! Snow fought. Oh!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leggo me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was Black there?" insisted the boss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. It was Lige Hackett." This re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred to one of the worthless loafers hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton had recovered his "balance, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself trembling and perspiring as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result of the fiendish scene he was wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessing. Every nerve in his body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingling. He knew the boss was his friend;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he admired Dolan for many things, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">here the boss sickened him. Though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man probably deserved this punishment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan's wTatli was too inhuman, and Carl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton feared--knew--that before his eyes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's neck was about to be broken. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed forward with all his desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and tore at those cruel fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quit it--quit it!" he pleaded. "Dolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">--come out of it! It's murder--murder!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'll be as bad as he is!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The savage eyes of the boss glared at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an instant, and Carlton wondered if he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, were to be a victim; th^n the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed an elbow in front of his eyes. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they were cleared again, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Holy smoke!" came the voice of Lange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind Carlton, in awTe at the miracle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the--what do you want me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do?" roared the boss. "Kiss him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, but don't kill him. You're a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputy sheriff. Why not arrest him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The idea seemed to be utterly novel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss of Mirage</seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boss showed quizzical wrinkles about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I might," he ruminated, "but how about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that county gang? Think I want them</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornin' up here? Nix!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, why not take the prisoner down</seg><seg type="columnLine">there?" suggested the engineer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The faces of the other men showed queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiles. Dolan also began to grin. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of himself descending from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">high rookery in the foot-hills to parade a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner into the county-seat, before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished and nervous gaze of the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">politicians, struck the boss's sense of humor</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that his grin became broad. Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not realize how deep was the line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">demarcation between the county's office-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holders and the lord of this foot-hill settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer could not know of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricks started by the politicians down below</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the purpose of "getting" Dolan for</seg><seg type="columnLine">past disfavors; neither did he ken of certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">crafty efforts to compel a willing but timor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous Board of Supervisors to cancel Dolan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">county liquor license. Carlton was blithely</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepping into the history of fifteen years of</seg><seg type="columnLine">red feud between Dolan, -with his axes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grind, and the politicians, with their axes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to grind--but he did not know it. Dolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said the boss. "Better leave well</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough alone. I'll arrest this man and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one else take him into town." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the prisoner. "Hey, you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're 'rested! Git that? You make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">move, and I'll ram your heels into the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your throat!" The sight of the lout</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to make Dolan's temper rise again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What did Black give you for the job?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he roared suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other shuffled his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nawthin'," he muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''What? Nothin'?" The boss reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his hand again. "Quit that lyin', or</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll strangle you again!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other flinched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!7' he cried, anxious to appease and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now hasty with explanations. "Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't give me nothin'. It was Finch. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time ago. Finch grub-staked me</seg><seg type="columnLine">four times. He gits his supplies from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yampa mine-freighters; so nobody knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. Then he called the debt. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sez he didn't want my mine. Sez he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted pers'nal service. Later on he sez</seg><seg type="columnLine">fer me to join Black when Black wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Then Black wanted me." The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulped. "I didn't intend to do it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black sez it was easy. An' then Snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">started scrappin', and--things happened!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yeh," said Dolan bitterly. "I git you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm gettin' a lot of things! How long ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">did Finch call the loan?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, six months ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss seemed to ponder for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, looking at the floor. Suddenly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed the man, searched him, swept him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a little bare cubby-hole in the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the store, locked the padlock, stormed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the door into the dance-hall, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sawed-off shotgun from behind the bar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined it and then strode outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It all happened so quickly that it left no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for remarks from the others, and Dolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to invite none. When it was over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two men looked at Carlton and grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Phew!" said the bow-legged Lange.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's started now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeh," agreed the other. "Goin' after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lige Hackett, the pal--or mebbe Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think we'd better follow him?" sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested Carlton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not on your life!

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man mopped his face with a bandanna.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let's have a drink," he offered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer felt he needed something</seg><seg type="columnLine">just then; so they ambled up to the scarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">old mahogany bar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MIKE, the bartender, served them</seg><seg type="columnLine">offhandedly.

When the boss come, he seen there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was goin' to be a lot of prospectors an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranchers in these parts; so he figgered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">gittin' ready for trade. First thing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">built was a saloon.

"Howr? Why, he started right back</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' done it all over again with the supplies!</seg><seg type="columnLine">That s how he done it! There's some people</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be made to quit, gents, but the boss,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he belongs to another family.

And yet, still further under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath--was it worthless? As the voluble</seg><seg type="columnLine">old bartender intimated, the incident ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertised Dan Dolan and his goods through-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the Southwest and laid the foundations</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a power which now seemed to hold this</seg><seg type="columnLine">district in the hollow of one mighty hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus in its last analysis the thing was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">masterpiece of business acumen, and yet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who had shown such acuteness was</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably out now, laying all his brains</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside, bringing himself into the gutter with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest and giving vent to his dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">passions by committing murder with a shot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun! Carlton was not sure, but he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had heard a muffled report from some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where outside during the bartender's nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men drank in silence, as if waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for something to happen. The engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a small drop for sociability, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and looked outside the door toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ramshackle street. A shadow crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan's board walk; then heavy footsteps</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded upon it. The boss strode in</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the shotgun still in his hand, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither to right nor left. He passed behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bar, threw the gun open, tossed out an</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty shell, blew down the barrel, threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a fresh cartridge and put the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the bar. After which he wiped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands on his trousers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what happened?" asked Carlton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got him," grunted Dolan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "WTio?" they all chorused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yager's pal. Lige Hackett."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dead?" asked the engineer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeh. He reached for a gun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a calm, easy statement. Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't admire that side of his friend. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him the chills. Also, there were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequences to consider. Though the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">free-and-easy customs were still in effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, the laws of the State were gaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground daily and must be reckoned with.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then Carlton remembered that Dolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was "in bad*' with certain persons "down</seg><seg type="columnLine">below" at the county-seat. And the boss</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken the law into his own hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," surmised the engineer slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I suppose we'll have investigations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. The folks down below will all be up</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They will not!" scorned the boss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you make that out?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was the old, shrewd, satisfied ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression on Dolan's face that showed he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not laid his brains aside after all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound it," roared the boss, "Didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you remind me I was a deputy sheriff?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, then Hackett died legal. He died</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistin' an officer!''</seg><seg type="columnLine">VIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS a clincher. The genial old</seg><seg type="columnLine">thug was so satisfied about his flaw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less act of manslaughter that Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only gasp. He felt himself coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the spell which made the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">bestow upon the boss an awe that was tinged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with admiration or fear, according to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">view-point. In a way the engineer was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to be nervous about Dolan. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like asking water to put out a fire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiving a cloudburst. Carlton began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder how it was all going to end. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he started wondering how it began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Arc--are you sure you got the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">man?" he asked at length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure? Why, didn't Axel Yager say</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hackett helped to kill Snow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Yes. I heard that. But how</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you know Yager was the right man?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Didn't he confess?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. But how' did vou know before</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss leaned across the bar and spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">very patiently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't I tell you once I was a merchant?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yeh. You remember. Well, 'bout twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago I got a lot of bandannas. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">set had a fioor-dc-lee pattern. I sold 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">out years ago, 'ceptin' one. Jest one. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">put her away among the old stock. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">roosted there for years. Then two weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago the Yager brothers came in for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandanna. I served 'em myself. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the stuff right then; so I dug around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Found that one. Sold it to Tom or Axel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I forgit which. She was the only floor-de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lee in the whole county. The pattern went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out years ago. Then Snow got killed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hold of that rag. It was Tom or Axel</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed him, but I didn't know which. Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slecpin' off a long jag; so it was Axel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">See? I t's simple to guess things when you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">a merchant, son!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton gave in. The boss was too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him. As a deputy sheriff Dolan had</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed a comfortable killing; as a mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chant he had tracked down a murderer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss of Mirage</seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a saloon-keeper he had provided for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting of Ebenezer Finch. Carlton won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered what other jobs or positions he</seg><seg type="columnLine">held.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you meet up with any one else?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the engineer, meaning jim Black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No." The face of the boss skewered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into perplexed wrinkles again. "Come into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the store, Carlton; I want to see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The curious engineer followed him back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the environment of barter and sale, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss leaned against a pile of blue overalls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Black's beat it. What do you make of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all?" asked Dolan, assured of privacy here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," admitted the engineer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It seems as if one tiling has led to another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know it isn't all about my little valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyhow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. That's a side issue. Finch got</seg><seg type="columnLine">you in; then somethin' came along bigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you. Then he wanted you out quick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tried the old boss game, but it wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. Takes too much time, anyhow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So he got Black on your trail. He wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to git you out quick. Why? I'll tell you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's because there's somethin' big doin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this county, and he's got a finger in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's crooked, or he'd be out of it. Black's</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it, too. Now, what is it, and where's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black gone to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe to the county-seat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolan nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think, so. Prob'ly lit out as soon's he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen my note to Lawyer Campbell, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snow died. He must have watched me</seg><seg type="columnLine">talkin' to Snow. I gave the letter to Snow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he seemed careless about it; so I yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him. Black must have thought it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">important. Mebbe he wanted to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much I knew. That's how Snow got</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed." The boss pondered for a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Funny thing--I didn't know that letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">was important myself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Naw. I jest took a guess. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gropin' in the dark. Do you know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in that note? I jest asked Campbell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look over the county records. Wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see how much land Finch or Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">owned in this country'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What got that idea into your head?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Because," said the boss,* "there's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">some funny doin's in this county for the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">year, and I didn't pay much 'terition to them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because I had my own troubles. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep at the switch. When you came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country7, you woke me up. I pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">you along because I wanted to see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doin'. Then I begun to see there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more goin' on than I ever dreamed of. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to rememberin' backward to certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">happenin's where men took up land around</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and then blew away'. D'ye begin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton saw. The boss abandoned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">choppy language and talked straight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engineer was struck between the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the revelation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's been a big land-grabbing deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, and Finch is in it. I see. But what's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purpose of it? And what is there</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked in that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolan answered the last question first</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothin'--mebbe. Only, there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of people owed Finch money' and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared. They' was friends of mine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good friends. They blew away sudden. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know they" owed Finch money. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't sure yet. I only got rumors long after</seg><seg type="columnLine">they went. But if the county records show</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Finch has their property-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss closed his fingers into a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist and looked down upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Savvy? Supposin' there was other folks</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that all over the county? How should</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know? People come and go. And sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posin' there was a lot of prospectors tradin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Yampa mine store? Finch owns</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock in the Yampa. I hear. Suppose them</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospectors had hard luck and ran up bills</seg><seg type="columnLine">they" couldn't pay*? S'pose Finch asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for pers'nal service? Suppose there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of dummy homesteaders in these lands</seg><seg type="columnLine">around here? What do you think of it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">CARLTON did not know what to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think. In fact, it was hard to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive that the drooling old slouch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lost Deer Valley could amount to so much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tiling looked incongruous. And yet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Finch in combination with the suave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Black, money- an^l unscrupulousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hand in hand, forming the age-old</seg><seg type="columnLine">alliance against which honest men have</seg><seg type="columnLine">battled for centuries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why did Black go to the county-seat?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurted Carlton. "That is, if he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know. Mebbe that'll be for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to find out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, you. When Black seen what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that note to Campbell, he streaked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">That s what it looked like, anyhow. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">28</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm goin' to send that note to Campbell</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, by you. Savvy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer thought of his wife, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch and all the other elements which</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed his attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how can I leave here?" he argued.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Take your wife," grunted Dolan. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip'll do her good. Weather's cool now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Take Bob Lange and Phil Johnson with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Take the pris'ner to the sheriff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll deputize you. It might be a good idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you to git acquainted down below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anvhow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I dunno," said the boss vaguely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It may come in handy. You're a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fesh'nul man. Helps business. Them two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hired men can 'tend to your ranch. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble possible now. Finch is sick in bed."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton felt that he was being wafted</seg><seg type="columnLine">along in the tide of Dolan's will, playing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">part in some larger drama than he suspecLed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the boss pulling the strings. And yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went. Dolan's logic was good, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton w'as impelled by curiosity to visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the county-seat, anyhow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus on the next morning, with his khaki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad wife astride a big black horse, Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">started out at the head of his cavalcade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under the engineer's khaki Norfolk jacket</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short-barreled Colt nestled in a holster.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somewhere in a pocket of the girl's skirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little two-barreled derringer, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other two travelers wore franker weapons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging over the hips of their overalls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the silent prisoner was unarmed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">party was ready for anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But nothing happened. No skulking</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures lurked in ambush in the long, sunny</seg><seg type="columnLine">vistas of sage-brush and greasewood, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rocks and w'ashed-out canons of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot-hills, nor in the miles of mesquite and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yucca-palms. Cool winds made the trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy, and they ambled along as if on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">picnic, taking thei* time and putting up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered ranch-houses at night. Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner caused no trouble. The others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were armed and had better horses, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the rests they stood guard over him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They arrived at the county-seat late in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning, heading for the county' jail</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the ramshackle old court-house, upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose top stood a flagpole and a decorative</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden statue of the period of 1870, once</seg><seg type="columnLine">chastely attractive but now grimy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacking a nose and two hands. Horses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">buggies went up and down the unpaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">main street. Others were alined along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitching-racks. Wagons arrived with goods</seg><seg type="columnLine">from near-by ranches, winding pasta Yampa</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine freight-team standing in front of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacksmith shop, with the leaders of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourteen big mules jingling bells from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">collars at every movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cow-punchers rode about the street or</seg><seg type="columnLine">loafed among the season's remaining flies</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the board sidewalk jutted into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roadway. The dingy old glass fronts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy little stores advertised the wares in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, but the main attractions were sacks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">oats and bales of hay lying by each open</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and displaying the latest market</seg><seg type="columnLine">quotations on signs done crudely in lamp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole town was a living contrast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was dreamy and bustling, civilized and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-savage, modem and bucolic, as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new West and old West were being intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced to each other here. A prospector,</seg><seg type="columnLine">toting many weapons and wearing the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair of a Buffalo Bill, led his two burros</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to a store and mopped his broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brimmed sombrero.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man in gray business clothes and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">derby hat went past him into the same store.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A cow-puncher in white angora "chaps,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">displaying guns and cartridge-belt, doffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hat to a schoolmaam in white, while a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelping dog-fight around the corner brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth denizens from four saloons, including</seg><seg type="columnLine">two brisk Eastern commercial travelers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and three Indians wearing giddy red</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Carlton and the girl it seemed like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to the outside world. They did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize what hermits they had been in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">little vallev. Here the roadway had trees--</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual umbrella and locust trees, while up</seg><seg type="columnLine">above there wasn't a tree for miles, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Carlton's own valley. Here there wras a</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden or two, with little white-painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses nestling among them. The sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">made them realize the community feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">thev had lacked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The party registered at the old-fashioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden hotel set within wide verandas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then Carlton and Bob Lange brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoner to the county jail, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lean-faced, mustached sheriff recovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his surprize, put the prisoner behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars and shot a string of questions at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer told him a straightforward</seg><seg type="columnLine">story about the prisoner's confession but</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss of Mirage</seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglected to speak of the other angles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting on advice from Dolan. 1 he sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally scratched his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ••But why did the feller kill Snow?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "What was the motive?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe it was robbery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh! All a freighter has is a whip an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chaw of terbacker! Fat chance! I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan's fell down. Gotta have better</seg><seg type="columnLine">motives than that to work on!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer moved a bit so the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the window would fall squarely on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff's face. He was about to "spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">something," and he wanted to observe every</seg><seg type="columnLine">move of the man's expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Snow's murder was ordered by Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black!" he announced very' quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff's face underwent a trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation for only a fraction of an instant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in that time Carlfbn learned what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought. There was some connection be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween this member of the "county gang"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the mysterious gunman of Mirage!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Them's strong words, young man!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped the sheriff. "It might be hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove! 'Course, I don't know this Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">very well, but still he's a citizen, and such</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarks might land you in a peck o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton shrugged his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't charge it," he retorted. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner confessed it himself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dan Dolan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeh. But how many witnesses?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Three."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Humph." The sheriff seemed to cogi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tate for some time, looking at the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I guess we'll have to 'vestigate this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're stayin' at the hotel? All right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'll be on hand if we want you. See</seg><seg type="columnLine">you later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with this easy dismissal the sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">went through the door into the cells, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton and his companion, feeling as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">something were wrong somewhere, walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the place thoughtfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">FACING the court-house was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little one-story red-painted office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a sign over the door bore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">legend: "William J. Campbell, Attorney</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Law." Carlton headed for this place</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone but found it locked. He learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Campbell would return later; so the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer went back toward the hotel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was off the main street. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a comer. He passed a cottage and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big hav-barn. Suddenly a man came</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the barn and almost bumped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. It was Jim Black!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They halted in surprize. The two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">appraised each other for a second; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black decided to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Howdy!" he said. "What brings you</seg><seg type="columnLine">here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, I'm just looking around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh. How far have you looked?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Far enough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gray, calculating eyes of the killer</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to flash, but there was no overt act.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black merely changed the subject a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Heard you brought in a prisoner," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">commented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's correct."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who was it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Axel Yager."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though Carlton watched Black closely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man did not seem as surprized as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be.* He merely nodded his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Dolan sent you?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see. Dolan sent you in. Well! Are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you aimin' to mix into local politics any?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The question brought the engineer's quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">temper boiling to the surface. Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it for a sneer and resented it. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick of this Jim Black person, anyhow. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lived under a mental strain because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Jim Black myth that seemed to hold a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole population in awe, and now he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascination to reach into that myth and see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it was made of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's it to you?" he flared. "I'll do</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I-please!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The outburst had an opposite effect to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one expected. Black put his hands in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pockets and seemed to cogitate. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out Carlton knowing it, the other was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidering whether to discommode his impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant affairs just then and entangle with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">pesky engineer, with possible embarrass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments up-country, or wait till all his present</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbing business affairs were disposed of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's nothing to me," he replied mildly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length. "I was just wonderin'. I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it'd be better for all hands if you didn't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will be the judge of that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure; sure. Go to it Right to the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the road. Go to it. Just so!" And.</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving an ironic hand, he turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked away, leaving the bewildered</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer standing there and wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether Jim Black were overestimated or</seg><seg type="columnLine">underestimated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Campbell was in when Carlton appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his office later, and with the attorney was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a florid-faced, well-dressed, bald-headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with shrewd eyes, introduced as Lu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cius Van Dorn, representing interests "look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the mines hereabouts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '•I'd like you to take him into your coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try when you go back/' said Campbell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He wants to look at the Yampa mine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other properties around there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tall, pleasant-faced attorney had</seg><seg type="columnLine">read Dolan's terse note And also an enclo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure concerning ihe engineer. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading w-as over, he seemed very thought-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me all about it," he invited.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton looked at Van Dorn, but the lat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter seemed thoroughly comfortable in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. Campbell caught the glance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead," he said. "Van Dorn's a--</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend of mine. He wants to know the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral situation up-country, anyhow. I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him it wfas a tough neighborhood. Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll make him believe it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still a bit wary because of the third per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, but accepting Campbell's judgment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton sat down and gave a detailed ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of much that had happened since</seg><seg type="columnLine">first he went into his little valley. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of it Campbell whistled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Phew! That's a pretty mess! I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly make head or tail of it! I won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der--I wonder if Dolan's intercepted note</seg><seg type="columnLine">has anything to do with certain powwows</seg><seg type="columnLine">the court-house bunch held last night with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some strangers. They kept the lights burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all night. There's something big in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, but--hello! Who's there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A knock rapped on the door, but before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attorney could open it the sheriff turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knob and walked in, followed by a chubby</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputy. The sheriff wasted no time on</seg><seg type="columnLine">formalities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey!" he bawled to Carlton. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of goin's-on are you havin' up in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, anyhow? What are you doin'?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Puttin'' up a game on me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Game?" challenged Carlton, rising from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chair. "What are you talking about?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What game?" The sheriff grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewdly. "Why, bringin' down a pris'ner</seg><seg type="columnLine">that confessed to murder because he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bein' choked to death! Tell me. Did Dan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan strangle this man or not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dolan tried to get the truth out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him!" snapped Carlton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yell." Sarcastically. "Truth! Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I was choked like that, I'd of confessed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">killin' President Lincoln! So would you!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Truth! Gosh! And then Dolan has the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold crust to send this man down here as</seg><seg type="columnLine">pris'ner on a charge of murder, after Dolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself killed that Hackett feller with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shotgun! Say!" The sheriff was getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited. "What--what sort of a slam-bang</seg><seg type="columnLine">place have you fellers got up there, anyhow'?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ain't there no law' or order there at all? Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole district jest one floatin' insane</seg><seg type="columnLine">asylum? How'd you happen to come into</seg><seg type="columnLine">this? How'd you come into cahoots with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not in cahoots with any one!" rasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton. "Dolan's a friend of mine. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand? He asked me to take a prisoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">down here, and I'v£ done it. If you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything to say to Dolan, go up there and</seg><seg type="columnLine">say it yourself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say it?" roared the sheriff. "It w'oiddn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do no good! That feller's got a brain like</seg><seg type="columnLine">marble! The only thing he'll listen to is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grand jury indictment!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What for?'' demanded the attorney.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"For everything! It might be for mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der an' conspircy to railroad this feller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Axel Yager, to the pen'tentiary! We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">had enough of Dolan in this country!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, go up and tell him so," invited</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff waved it away angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As for you, young feller," he snapped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you'd better neglect to say much about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Black promptin' any one to kill Snow!</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's nothin' in it. Nothin'. See? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">I jest seen Jim Black."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew you would," nodded Carlton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sheriff did not know' which way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the remark; so he let it go. Campbell</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke in upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you're going to let Yager go?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Going to? No. I done it already!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"On his own recognizance, I suppose?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure. The district attorney advised it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What is there to hold him on?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton's brain w*as working fast. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered how placid the prisoner had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been during his march into the countv-seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wondered if the man believed he was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come among friends. Considering that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder charge was hanging over his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's docility had been remarkable!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss of Mirage</seg><seg type="columnLine">3i</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then my trip was all for nothing!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. What else could it be? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole thing's wrong. Everything's wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Dolan in it. You tell that feller I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to see him. If he don't come down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few days, we'll go up after him! We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">straighten out that buzzard-roost, or we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">know why!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Attorney Campbell pointed a mandatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sheriff," he said, "you may do as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see fit. I see no reason to interfere with</seg><seg type="columnLine">your duty--or with your personal grudges.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I only want to warn you that, if the prison-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er is guilty, you have laid yourself open to</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious charges as an official of this county!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll take the advice of the district</seg><seg type="columnLine">attorney on that. I ain't goin' to you for</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice; that's certain!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ••No," said the attorney. "And it's too</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad. Well, good day!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I said good day!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff thought it over for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then took the hint. Silence ensued. Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorn, who had not stirred a muscle before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">began mopping his fat face and bare fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By George!" he exclaimed. "This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most interesting country I ever got into.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you stage these rows every day?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Every other day," smiled Campbell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's just routine business now. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day --" and his face lighted a bit--"we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a new deal in this county, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she'll begin to be worth while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the big trouble?" asked Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stick-in-the-mud ideas. New-fangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilings--like better roads or power lines or</seg><seg type="columnLine">sewer systems--bring in new folks, new</seg><seg type="columnLine">manners of running things and possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher taxes. These are the main troubles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for crookedness, and that's hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove. If I went into these courts with</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything but iron-clad, riveted, absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">proven cases, I'd be laughed out of court;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I'm stuck. The whole county's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolled--even down to the janitor in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">court-house."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The illuminating talk struck Cariton</seg><seg type="columnLine">amidships. Carlton was one of those "new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fangled" arrivals with "new-fangled" ideas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a minor point, but it was just an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other mite of e\idence pointing toward a</seg><seg type="columnLine">connection between the county politicians</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the slouchv old miser of Lost Deer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You folks stay here," finished Camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell, reaching for his hat. "I'm going over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the court-house to look at those records</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Dolan. He must be playing some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunch. Make yourselves at home." And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he vanished through the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With Campbell well on his errand, Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorn started asking shrewd questions about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan's country, keeping up the conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion while Carlton kept his eye on the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">old clock ticking on the dingy wall over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rack of California reports and other law</seg><seg type="columnLine">books banked up from the desk. An hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed. Then Campbell strode through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doonvav, laid his hat carefully over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ink-well and turned to the other two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dolan will not get his information," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced.

Inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house the young wife kept a stove going</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost steadily, feeding it from piles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord-wood stacked up in a newly-built</seg><seg type="columnLine">woodshed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton worked from mom to night, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pairing fences, fixing old roofs, improving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fields and putting odd hours into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">system of irrigating ditches on which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">set his mind.

Then he started work, digging into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, blasting away rocks and pine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumps and building gates and laterals to</seg><seg type="columnLine">connect the little toy ditches of the future</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the main irrigation system.

He enjoyed every</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sometimes Carlton went outside and sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veyed boundaries for others, suaightening</seg><seg type="columnLine">out disputes concerning property lines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were often in helter-skelter condition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In this way he became well acquainted</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the district, meeting all sorts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, some of them belonging to the pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turesque days of Bret Harte and others</seg><seg type="columnLine">hailing recently from Michigan or'Missouri</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Iowa. They were the fruits of the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Western railroads in offering "colo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nist rates" and attracting the great popula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of settlers which was even then be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to make the new West. Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them went to the cities; some to the rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">farm-lands, and some of the more adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turous, willing to "take a chance," drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Carlton gained the greatest collec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of new acquaintances through his short</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit to the county-seat. After the episode</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Campbell learned that the county</seg><seg type="columnLine">records had been secreted, the lawyer had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken the engineer about and introduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to acquaintances who had happened in</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all corners of the county. Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these met Carlton's wife also. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine-owners from the Black Rock country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the east; ranchers from the southern flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands about Escalante Creek and W'illow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creek; hay and grain traders from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alfalfa tracts surrounding the county-seat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prospectors from all the hills and</seg><seg type="columnLine">valleys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Campbell had not t ried to regain the lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">records. He explained that he did not wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">to seem too eager; so he put in the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time going around with Carlton. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting of Van Dorn and Lhe guiding of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stout personage and two of the latter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eastern friends to Mirage were mere inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dents. He had left them with Dolan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A month went by without happenings in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley and apparently with none out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Even the sheriff had not made good</seg><seg type="columnLine">his threat to "clean Dolan out." Carlton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">little place was changing. A cow, a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">collie dog, two kittens, five ducks and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">ddzen chickens added life to the place and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it more homelike. He had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in from "down below," and in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart he felt they constituted a sort of chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenge. They made for a permanent resi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence, as if Jim Black and Ebenezer Finch</seg><seg type="columnLine">never existed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Finch came back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rode by on a sorrel mare just at night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall one day, trailing two pack-mules laden</seg><seg type="columnLine">with supplies and bringing a nondescript</seg><seg type="columnLine">hired man in faded overalls, who paid no at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention to the Carlton domicile but plugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">right along for the upper ranch. Finch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, seemed to take an interest in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton improvements, noting the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">woodshed, chicken-coops and cow-bam with</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciative eyes that peeped out from un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der an antiseptic bandage. He even nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Carlton, but the latter kept about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer sensed that there would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">further complications when Finch arrived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were. A week later Finch</seg><seg type="columnLine">strolled across Lhe meadow and approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little green picket-fence of the garden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving a white handkerchief somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">ironically. Carlton was washing his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the kitchen and strolled forth with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">towel in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what do you want?" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded, across the fence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why--I sorter felt I'd like to have a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighborly talk with ye," answered Finch</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the old persuading, wheedling, whining</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "I thought mebbe as haow we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to patch up them little troubles so's</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'd be right friendly again. There hain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a hoss or a mewl pizened since I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and 1 calc'lateyou been right neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">borly abaout it. I thought mebbe you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed your mind; so I sez to myself, sez I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Let bygones be bygones;' so I come over</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to make things friendly again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's kind of you,'' nodded Carlton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Didn't I say once I'd probably shoot you</seg><seg type="columnLine">on sight?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    FINCH waggled the white rag</seg><seg type="columnLine">isIS hastily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        "You was all excited an' ruffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up," he deprecated. "A pusson's li'ble to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say anything when he's that way. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss of Mirage</seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg><seg type="columnLine">sez I, 'A soft answer turneth away wrath;'</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I'm a-trvin' to make things neighborly</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Now abaout them hosses." Finch</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved them away. "It wasn't the loss,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was only the principle of the thing. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't look friendly to pizen hosses. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">kin see that yourself. But now we kin forgit</seg><seg type="columnLine">them tilings--that is, if you want to stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. Mebbe you don't want to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finch's eyes showed a crafty look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me' hear your offer," demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton tersely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--you been right decent abaout</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stock while I was away in the hors-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pittle; so I calc'late I kin skeer up mebbe</seg><seg type="columnLine">six thousan' or so-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I paid eight thousand!" reminded Carl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you couldn't expect me to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">that much, considerin' me bein' sick with</seg><seg type="columnLine">eary-sipilis with all sorts of doctor bills and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a danged white nurse that cost me twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five dollars a week. Tain't fair. I'm a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick man. You wouldn't take advantage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me bein' sick, would you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wheedling, self-pitying whine made</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton want to hit the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your price is too low!" he snapped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well---'tain't exac'ly the right thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take advantage of a sick man that hain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hisself yit; it seems like things is cornin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorter hard fer me--sorter hard--but 'Live</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' let live' is my mottow; so mebbe I kin</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeer up eight thousan'.

He glanced sideways but got no</seg><seg type="columnLine">response. "Or mebbe ten thousan'. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dunno. I reckon a man gits old an' fool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish.

"It's takin' ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of a poor, sick ol' man, but-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton leaned over the fence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know how much I'll take?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lemme hear it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One million dollars!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finch's jaw sagged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why--why--that's plum' foolish!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped. "It's--it's-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly! The whole talk is foolish!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You couldn't get this ranch for all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">3</seg><seg type="columnLine">money you've got! Now you get across</seg><seg type="columnLine">that field and stay there! Move!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finch's jaw quit sagging and clamped to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That hain't the way to talk!" he pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Git!" snapped Carlton, pointing toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper ranch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mandate seemed to touch some hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den spring that threw away a mask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Who? Me?" The old miser trembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment. "Hey? Hey? You'll talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">outa the other side of yer maouth pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon!

I'll show you!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huh--I'll show you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer, at first startled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformation, looked one moment into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hectic face of Finch and then quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">started along the fence toward the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate. He reached the gate before Finch was</seg><seg type="columnLine">half finished, and he reached Finch just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter came to the end. Finch backed</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with his feet, but his mouth held its</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground manfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you start nothin'," he warned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You hit me, an' I'll make things so hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll wish you'd never saw the place!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hey-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton lashed out. It was his only</seg><seg type="columnLine">comment. An instant later he regretted it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had not properly gaged the growth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm and shoulder muscles, and the crush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blow knocked Finch half-wa v across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lane. It crashed into that snarling, leering</seg><seg type="columnLine">face just below the eye, and, when the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gineer lifted the dizzy man up. he saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish welt on that countenance as big as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">egg-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton had struck a man just out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hospital. His temper disappeared in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flood of blame for himself. He lifted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man almost tenderly and stood him on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry,'' he said contritely, before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw how foolish the remark sounded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sorry you're sick, that is," he amended.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you were well, now, I'd take pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">in knocking your head off!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The victim gave him one look, and in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance the engineer saw a cold malevolence</seg><seg type="columnLine">as dangerous as the fangs of a snake. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">34</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch did not say anything. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">even brush himself. He simply turned away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked straight across the held to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own lands, with the engineer watching until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had passed the last oak tree up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope. Then Carlton finished washing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face very thoughtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wife had noticed the incident from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, and so had one of the helpers. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the time they arrived, it was over. Later</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the engineer became nervous. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain was returning. Some one always</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept awake of nights now, guarding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. And yet nothing happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dan Dolan arrived suddenly at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week, riding a buckskin horse that looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">piteous under the great load. The boss</seg><seg type="columnLine">came alone and unheralded, wearing an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed khaki outfit, a broad-brimmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat and a pair of shining new boots just off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his counters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thought I'd put up for the night," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced. "May stay two nights. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way to Red Rock, back in the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains. Movin' on the quiet. Meet a friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">there Thursday, mebbe. Don't say I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton welcomed him, and the wife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though somewhat reserved, prepared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make him comfortable. Thus, while she</seg><seg type="columnLine">busied herself in the little kitchen for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening meal, the boss spread his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk in a creaking chair before the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">fireplace while the engineer told him of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latest incidents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew all about it," was Dolan's com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. "I'm watchin' things here. Finch</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems desp'rate to git you out of the way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, do you think he'll carry out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">threats?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nope. He's too busy now. Got too</seg><seg type="columnLine">many irons in the fire. If he hurt you, he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have too much extry trouble. He's only</seg><seg type="columnLine">trvin' to skeer you. Mebbe that's all he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can think of jest now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, he won't scare me, but I'll admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">this thing keeps me nervous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It'll be over pretty soon," grunted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What makes you think so?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolan gave the engineer one of his know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing glances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Son," he observed, "if anything hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to you, it'll tear the county to pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one big fight! For a year or more this</seg><seg type="columnLine">county's been wakin'--wakin' like a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">from sleep. There's a crowd here that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked things for years. A combination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's like a net--one strand tied to another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was a strand once. I got into a row with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest and backed out. I'd begun to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I was headin'. But the other strands</seg><seg type="columnLine">held strong together. They tied up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">still other strands. Only, it was all under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Couldn't be traced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you came in. You made me look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Finch more careful. The more I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more I seen. Finch seemed like one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the strands. Biraeby he begun to ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear like a main cable. Then I dug around</seg><seg type="columnLine">some more. There was men that hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch for many reasons. There was men</seg><seg type="columnLine">that backed Finch for many reasons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savvy? They begun to take sides. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines are drawin* tight. Then there's men</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's workin' for the county gang, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's them that's ag'in 'em. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">county's organized--both ways--and you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spark that'll mebbe set off the sky-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rockets!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me?" gasped Carlton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You or Finch. If any tiling happens to</seg><seg type="columnLine">either one, there's goin' to be a crash! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole county's lined up! If you'd paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">much 'tendon to politics, you'd 'a* seen it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wife was taking a dish of steaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">soup to the table, but she halted, petrified,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the lamplight setting off the astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment on her pretty face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great Scott!" exclaimed Carlton. "So</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm a casus belli!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dunno what that is," said the boss,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dubiously, "but there's goin' to be hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pening around here--darned soon!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">CARLTON was thunderstruck at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the importance thrust upon him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He began to see why he had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the county-seat and why Campbell had</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduced him around to thoughtful men</seg><seg type="columnLine">from every section of the county. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was war on from Thunder Mountain to</seg><seg type="columnLine">South End, and he was one of the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">factors!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet the boss seemed to be comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able about it--very. He appeared to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the satisfied, exalted expression of the cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had swallowed the cream. It made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engineer wonder whose funeral was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing next. The boss was like some volcano</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, to eliminate an irritating ant-hill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">might blast away a whole province.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You set your mind easy, ma'am," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan to the w-ife. "There w'on't nothin'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">;</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss of Mirage</seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen to you folks.

"Folks ought to live in peace."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Peace?" came Dolan's deep voice, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lowing of a bull. "Yes, ma'am; we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' to have peace in this county if we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn her inside out! And I'm goin' to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work for it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss walked over to the waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner-table with the rest and made himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable, tucking his napkin into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">collar of his soft shirt and making the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife ready for business by wiping it care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully on the napkin--an impolite action</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused by years of eating in a certain Chi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nese restaurant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm gittin' a little old, ma'am," he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued. "I'm gittin' tired of fights and ruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. There's a new time cornin' in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, ma'am. Please pass the butter."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You mean that things are going to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely different?" she asked.

If 1 could close my</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance-hall now, I'd do it, ma'am, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not? Why not close it--or sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose I did. S'pose some other sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner took my place. Ran the joint.

If there must be crime and</seg><seg type="columnLine">riot up here, ain't it better to have some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">around that can reg'late it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton changed the subject hastily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The view-points of the tough old Western</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon-keeper and the cultured girl, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother was president of a Philadelphia</seg><seg type="columnLine">branch of the Women's Christian Temper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance Union, were a trifle too divergent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thereafter they talked on various topics</seg><seg type="columnLine">until late, and peace reigned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the hours wore on, Carlton began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice his wife thawing perceptibly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boss. Though he was crude and coarse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grained, lacking in morals except by his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">blunt code, there was a magnetism and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner strength which reached beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of culture or prejudice and gripped like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vise those upon whom he bestowed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship. Here, before the firelight where</seg><seg type="columnLine">pine-logs blazed, the boss of the roughest</seg><seg type="columnLine">section of the West seemed a different man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was about the first home atmosphere he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ever in, and, though he never quite over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came his awkwardness, his soul seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm in the glow of the hearth-flames.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke of Indian-fights of bygone days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of great gold-strikes, great feuds and queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">characters, until the whole colorful, tragic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">romantic Southwest'of the old days seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to appe^- before them as on a screen. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke with the bland innocence of a child,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing things with the clear prejudices of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">child's lucid, but elemental, mind. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was good, another bad; a well's water</seg><seg type="columnLine">was good or bad; a community was good</seg><seg type="columnLine">or bad. There was no neutral between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pie had picked a child out of a blizzard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and given it his scanty provisions until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">died despite his savage desire for its life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One man he saved from a mob; another's</seg><seg type="columnLine">life he blew out as one would snuff a candle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He spoke of the one as blandly as the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And during his whole recital there was hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esty, honesty, honesty until the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to ring under the spell of his down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what do you think of him?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton of his wife later, when the stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">were shining coldly into their little dark up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I pity him!" she responded. "I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw such a fine man gone to waste! I pity</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with all my heart!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, don't tell him that," he advised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepily; and then he forgot all about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton awroke with a start and peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the dark room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "WHiat was that?" he wdiispered, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticking of the little alarm-clock was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only response. *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strained to hear better. A cricket</seg><seg type="columnLine">chirped somewhere outside, and a watcher</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dining-room rustled a newspaper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The engineer, feeling foolish, slid back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five minutes later he awoke again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching at the coverlets. Far away, faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his ears, came a vague but persistent</seg><seg type="columnLine">36</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">drumming, drumming, drumming that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean but one thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Horses!" he gasped. "They're going</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the pass! Hear it?" He shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife out of her slumbers. "Hear that?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">She came to consciousness slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hear something," she said at last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"ft sounds like animals running." She</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed quiet for a time. "They're com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. not going!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton sprang out of bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe Finch is up to something!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">surmised.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They're coming!" she reiterated. "Wait!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard a metallic sound. They're going</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the lane. I wonder what time it is."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton lit a match and peered into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Three in the morning," he announced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went to ihe window and looked out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing nothing but the cold stars and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old copper mountain whose black silhouette</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed high above. And still the eery</seg><seg type="columnLine">drumming continued. Carlton at length</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought lie could almost hear the creak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of saddle-leather. He grasped his trousers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and boots and pulled them on. He picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his Winchester and got ready to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">down-stairs, but, while he was organizing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noise of the spectral cavalcade grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">fainter and fainter until only the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cricket could be heard, seeming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckle over the mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems to be over," announced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife. "They didn't stop here. They went</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the valley. Better get back to bed. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess it won't affect us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not so sure!" responded Carlton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's something fishy here. It sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a troop of cavalry--and Dolan's in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this house. I wonder if they're after him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Scott, it may be the sheriff with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">posse, putting up at Finch's for the night!''</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton grabbed all his clothes off a chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began to move as if he were through</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sleeping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you going to do?" she asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, I'm going to look into this tiling!</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's some monkey-business going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-"</seg><seg type="columnLine">SfT" THE muffled crack of a shot came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his ears from far across the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">E_J fields. He ran to the window, but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toning his shirt. There was a quick flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the brush near Finch's house--then</seg><seg type="columnLine">another. Then another. The far-away</seg><seg type="columnLine">reports began to roll like musketry. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a faint, stifled yell--then a fusillade</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sounded like tire-crackers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A pin-point of steady flame arose from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark blotch that stood where a Finch barn</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to be. It grew ^ bit. Then a lurid</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow glare sprang up from the place as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the hay had caught lire at once. Horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">started stampeding in the distant fields,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundering their hoofs as they milled around</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside their fences. The glare swung high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">illuminating the sides of the tumble-down</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses and barns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton jumped down-stairs two steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a time, holding the Winchester. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed upon the tenant less dining-room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the hearth-embers were still glow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and a Ugh ted lamp stood upon the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">table-cloth. He looked out of the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of the hired men was standing outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the threshold, smoking a corn-cob ami</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking across the field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello!" lie ejaculated. "You up?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Looks as if there's trouble over there?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Dolan?" demanded the engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Him? Oh, mebbe he's asleep. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeps sound, Dolan does. No use to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him. Let him sleep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton grunted assent and walked for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. swinging open his yard gate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">making for the oak groves on the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of liis ranch. He was filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity. It was a riot, nothing less. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">riot in his valley! What did it mean?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked past the dark willow's of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creek and neared his boundary', where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-built irrigation ditch lay. The shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrere keeping up, some singly and some in</seg><seg type="columnLine">gusts, and. as he went nearer, he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silhouettes of men dodging about in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light of the crackling fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came to the ditch and nearly fell in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He started walking along it cautiously. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse whickered from an oak grove to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. He turned and approached it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally' discerned the dark forms of horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">massed under a tree. He put out his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and patted a soft muzzle, noting the bridle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cry came to his ears. He sensed that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">form was staggering across the ditch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching the horses. He held his rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">read}- and walked toward the man warily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man's breath seemed to be sucking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a broken-down pump, but even in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain he noticed the engineer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss of Mirage</seg><seg type="columnLine">37</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey!" he yelled. "Keep away! Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">are vou?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm Carlton. I own this place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So did I!" snarled the other, with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unearthly note of triumph in his voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I'm even now! I got him! Dang</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hide to Tophet, I got him--at last--</seg><seg type="columnLine">oh!" He started gurgling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton bent over him quickly and struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">a match.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tom Fulton!" he gasped. "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot, man--your shirt's all red!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeh!" snarled Fulton. "He got me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sat up in bed an' shot till he keeled over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But we got him. Oh!" And lie put his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to his chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton knew whom Fulton had shot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In his mind he visualized the murderous</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol-battle in Finch's old shanty, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack of vengeful demons spurting hot lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the dark doorway and the miser</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying as he had lived--alone in a corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Carlton heeded his duty to a helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. The poor monomaniac who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not forget an injury lay on Lhe ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasping with pain. The engineer picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him up gently and tried to lead him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a horse, but the man collapsed. Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged him a little way but soon noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that others were coming across the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields. The firing had ceased. The sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old bam were tumbling down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flames were reducing. It all seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another vague human form came toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horses, then some more. Carlton called</seg><seg type="columnLine">for assistance and explained who he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make sure of them. Mysterious hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped Fulton and put him over a horse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other ghostly hands lashed him into place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vague, bashful voices bade the engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">take Fulton to his home, promising to</seg><seg type="columnLine">summon medical aid immediately. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark forms sprang to horses and gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loped away--presumably to hasten the</seg><seg type="columnLine">medical aid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leading the horse and stumbling forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton came to his house and yelled toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the closed door. Every window was il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminated, but he did not notice that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door swung open, and his wife and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two helpers appeared. And then he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss was seated at the table, fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed, with account-books and papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rough filing-cabinets piled hi^h in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of him on the red table-cloth. Papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were everywhere--yellow, white, blue and</seg><seg type="columnLine">green--littering the whole table and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor. The boss seemed engrossed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to the exclusion of every'thing else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Carlton and the others took Fulton to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, after which the engineer rushed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">join Dolan. Then he stood irresolute.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boss looked as if he had struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure of the ages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gosh!" he mumbled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then he struck another find, and his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened still wider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What is it?" interrupted Carlton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">. The boss looked up like some old lion</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding venison in his paw and loath to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the evidence," he snapped. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked himself and explained. "The evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence. Savvy? Somebody took it from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch place and left it here accidental."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A coincidence, of course," said Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gentle irony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. Coincidence. But it's jest</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough coincidence to bust open this</seg><seg type="columnLine">county from end to end! It's changed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole deal. You thought you was in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight for your ranch. I thought I was in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">county political fight. Son, do you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the trail leads to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Into the gen'ral offices of a big railroad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Department of the Interior and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mebbe into the halls of the United States</seg><seg type="columnLine">Congress!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">X</seg><seg type="columnLine">"WHAT?" shouted the engineer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The boss lit a black cigar having</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dimensions and about the smell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sewer-pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Abso-lutely!" he responded. "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough dynamite in them papers to rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">the State!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Carlton sank into a chair while his wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined him from the sick-room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "W'hat's the general idea of it all?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded. "What's happened? Begin at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, let's see. Near as I can make out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's a plan up in Congress to build a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">dam across Thunder Mountain Creek for</seg><seg type="columnLine">irrigation. There was a lot of talk about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it some time ago, but it all died down. I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean forgot about it. Then this year,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Congress wjas fiddlin' over bills, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body started the Thunder Mountain thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Then a 'lectric comp'ny seen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance for a power project, and the railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to build a supply-line. Also</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to tap the country when the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">was irrigated and the settlers came in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savvy? Everything seemed to come at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once--the gosh-dangdest proj&gt;osition the</seg><seg type="columnLine">county ever seen!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss's eyes grew mystic, and he blew</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen smoke-rings. "She'd irrigate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land from Thunder Mountain clear down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Escalante. She'd bring in a new deal all</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. New settlers. Homes. Fruit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranches. Power lines. Roads. Schools.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, in five years real-estate here'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sellin' in Chicago and New York, like they</seg><seg type="columnLine">do in Los Angeles. Hut all this was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quiet. Congress hadn't done nothin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, and neither had the railroad. Or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power company. They was only considerin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and they didn't want it to git out so's</seg><seg type="columnLine">to start land-speculation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then somebody leaked. I git this</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Finch's papers, but some things is</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed up. It may be congressman, rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road man or map-maker; 1 dunno. I only</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that right away some influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">started buy-in' up all the land in sight, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quiet. Buy-in', beggin' or stealin'. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew there was somethin' goin' on, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't lay my finger on it. Bimeby I seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the county gang was in it. Later on</seg><seg type="columnLine">I begun to see Finch and Black in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch seemed to be the main purchasin'-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent for the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mebbe they figgered nobody'd suspcct</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Only, he couldn't play square, him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Black. They slugged people with</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, mortgages or grocery' bills. Bimeby</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had all sorts of land around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot-hills here. Meantime, they held up</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own crowd. They bought cheap and</seg><seg type="columnLine">padded the expcnse-accounts. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch all through. He jest grabbed. Could-</seg><seg type="columnLine">n't play square even on a crooked deal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just wasn't built that way. Savvy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I understand. But let's get this</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight. How much actual crime is un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh--look here. Suppose some con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressman was makin' money out of it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">S pose they was aimin' to fix high prices</seg><seg type="columnLine">for rights of way for the Gov'ment or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad or power comp'ny? S'po&gt;e there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was others mixed up in Finch's or Black's</seg><seg type="columnLine">killin's? S'pose Finch didn't have to pay'</seg><seg type="columnLine">taxes on them lands he held? S'pose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">records in the recorder's office was 'mislaid'</seg><seg type="columnLine">so's the County gang wouldn't have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay for taxes either? S'pose it was proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dummy homesteaders was workin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere? S pose the whole county was</seg><seg type="columnLine">jest loot, loot, loot? I)'ye see where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail leads? Crime? Why, there's enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">crime to keep the jails busy' for twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Phew!" w'histled Carlton. "And W'hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">are y'ou going to do with all this evidence?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give it to Van Dorn. He's a Gov'ment</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He was ordered out here to snoop</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and look into things. Him and me</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a long powwow. He seen all that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen, but we couldn't get no further. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the county records was closed to us. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">milled around like stray burros, me waichin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trails here and him diggin' up things</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside. Finally Van Dorn says the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to git anything was to git into Finch's</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and look over his papers. But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't no way to do that except by breakin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the law."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolan's bland explanation made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," he nodded. "And then, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">by luck, a lot of crazy hoodlums raided</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch's place and took out the papers by</seg><seg type="columnLine">accident."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jest so," nodded the boss. "Coin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cidence. Tom Fulton got over his bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and worked up his revengeful sperrits.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then there w as others got het up, till finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">they all got so darned mad they jest couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand it any longer. Savvy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Yes, I savvy," admitted Carlton. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">savvy it all. Quite a wonderful coincidence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then your being here tonight--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure it was. I jest stopped here on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">way beyond to see a man. Now I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed myr mind; but if questions is ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked I can show- him for a witness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savvy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I understand," said Carlton gently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he sighed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through whisky, chicanery^, arson, riot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and manslaughter his salvation had come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, though lie knew that the valley of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">home was saved to him for keeps, he won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered now if the price had not gone far</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond him. The boss was watching him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious and puzzled, as if trying to interpret</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expression in Carlton's face and that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't I do right?" he demanded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the simple directness of a child.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Boss of Mirage</seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer countered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think this riot will kill off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances for the dam?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not much! And, when she's built, she'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be built fair and square. The water'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">come down clean to a land that's clean."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well--in that case, I guess it's worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">the price. I wonder who's going to own</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finch's place now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dunno. Mebbe I will. Finch prob'ly</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't leave a will or have any heirs; so the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land'll go back to the State. Mebbe I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">buy it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton's mind took another tack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you run across the trail of Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black?" he asked, pointing to the papers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. Tracks all over the place. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorts of money passed between 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From Finch to Black, of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. That's the queer part of it. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black to Finch!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Black didn't have any money!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's what I thought. But look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them receipt-books."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton leaned over and began pawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the papers. Everything was there--</seg><seg type="columnLine">every transaction of Finch's for years back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked down with a scrupulousness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">amounted to a mania. He even had</seg><seg type="columnLine">duplicates of the receipts he gave, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">these showed the trail of Jim Black. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">more Carlton looked the more interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">he became, until at length his wife tapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on the shoulder. He looked up. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness was gone. The lamp was burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly, and the skies outside held the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">haze of dawn. Dolan was sleeping in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair and snoring gently, with a smile on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face as if he were living again in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heroic days of his youth. The red embers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fireplace had turned to gray ashes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fulton is dead," she announced very</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dead?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton stared at his wife, then looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the window to where a bird on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limb of a tree was just starting its first song</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the day, bidding the world to waken</seg><seg type="columnLine">to life and sunshine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wife sighed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should it. be like this?" she asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">helplessly. "It seems there's been nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but tragedy since we came."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe it's part of the price we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay," lie said gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The price of our living here? If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that, I wouldn't stay another</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. It isn't the price for us. It's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger thing than us. We're in it, but we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the thing itself. It's just the price</seg><seg type="columnLine">of civilization, girl--working up through</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedies to happiness. Nothing is born</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a pang, and so these things are</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural."</seg><seg type="columnLine">DAN DOLAN woke them an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, when the sun was streaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">slantwise through the tidy curtains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The engineer was sunk in a great chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she was perched on its broad leathern</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and sleeping peacefully on his shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boss was loath to spoil the picture, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the papers littering the room cried for</seg><seg type="columnLine">action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At Dolan's yell the couple cajne to life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the embarrassed wife rushed off to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attend to her belated kitchen duties.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlton arose to bring in some wood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you going to do now?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked as he stretched himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goin' to bring this stuff into town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Van Dorn's there. You better come with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Mebbe there'll be somethin' doin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus within an hour the young engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the old saloon-keeper loped through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pass and into the long road that led</seg><seg type="columnLine">through bleak and barren lands to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumble-down settlement of Mirage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Van Dom was there, and so were many</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, who drank at Dolan's bar or played</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards at tables or lounged about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitcliing-racks outside and swrapped yarns.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Except for a subdued air of excitement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it appeared like a casual, go-as-you-please</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering of strays from every section of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lulls and valleys of the desert county.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here was a prospector with frayed clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heavy beard; yonder, a ranch-owner</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing expensive high boots and Stetson</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat.

He wrent to the door and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Swinging up the street came a score</seg><seg type="columnLine">of horsemen riding close together, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurs and bits jingling, rifles slung over</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and pistol-butts protruding from</seg><seg type="columnLine">many holsters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sheriff!" gasped Carlton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Van Dorn jumped and thrust his loot</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a heap of tents and blankets. Carl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton hastened into the dance-hall, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boss stood in front of the bar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chatted with a coterie of friends as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing were happening. The cavalcade</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew up to the building. The loungers</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the porch ambled in through the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not a comment was made bv any one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The atmosphere* seemed charged with</seg><seg type="columnLine">something quiet and chilly and deadly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In spite of the low murmur of conversation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there seemed to be a silence that shrieked</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the big board dance-hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then the sheriff came in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ,He stamped through the doorway at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of an armed delegation that acted</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a company of militia taking charge of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rioters' headquarters, pointing no weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">but lining up along the front wall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing ready for any tiling. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups of silent men massed behind Dolan</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the rear of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff advanced directly toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">towering boss of Mirage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "i've come for an accountin'," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced, holding hands warily at his hips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What sort o' madhouse you runnin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">up here? You're a deputy. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was very direct, and it put the boss</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the defensive instantly. He stood there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the largest man in the place and the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all eyes, figuring on how to avoid being</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullied and yet prevent a holocaust which</seg><seg type="columnLine">might exterminate the whole roomful.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not want to start hostilities between</seg><seg type="columnLine">these masses of armed men, but bis choleric</seg><seg type="columnLine">temper was straining to the breaking-point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tried hard to fight it down, and at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">he succeeded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mike!" he bawled to his bartender.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where's my deputy's star?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dunno.

"Gimme that star!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rasping sounds ensued outside, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bartender returned with a piece of pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a deputy sheriff's star stuck tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the joint.

A score of men stood as if the earth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> had opened beneath them.

He had started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappear, but Van Dorn had been noting</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from the first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Government man strode fonvard. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">did Carlton. Black saw he could not jam</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the throng quickly enough; so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned. His hand whipped to his side. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol flashed out and pointed straight at Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorn. The men beside the latter jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the line of fire, while those behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Black also scattered. Dolan speeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind his bar, but nobody noticed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Quit that! \rou're under arrest!" yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white-faced Government man to Black.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Put up that gun!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take me!" invited Black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was smiling through slit eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">o-ouching fonvard like a cat about to spring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Government man wras plucky enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the pistol-barrel w-as unwavering, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his round face began to give forth per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiration. He decided to spar for time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So this is wrhere you've come to!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked, trying to appear easy. "We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched the wrhole United States for you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Barton.

Come on;</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop that gun. Quit it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take me!" challenged Black, backing</seg><seg type="columnLine">away slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men were getting behind chairs, tables,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls, the bar and everything else handy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sheriff was flattening himself against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the picture of a prize-fighter. His deputies</seg><seg type="columnLine">had forgotten their errand and were scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered all over the place. Carlton was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little to one side of Van Dorn, standing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground and wondering just what to do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not want to produce a pistol and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps start something; neither did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust Black and his weapon. He therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept his hands near his sides and awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">developments. Black looked like a crouch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing panther.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet the bald-headed Van Dorn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">palpably unarmed, started to walk forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">while holding his empty hands out. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his decision. He was a Government</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and knew the power and weight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, relentless moral forces behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He figured that, as Black had been a Gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment man, he fully realized the useless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of opposing those forces, thus being</seg><seg type="columnLine">amenable to a peaceful arrest. For Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jig. was up. Even he could see it. Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorn had not been fed full of Black's repu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation as a gunman; neither did he believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that any man could kill an unarmed one in</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold blood. Therefore, part in earnest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">part as a bluff, he laid his human fears</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside and advanced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look out!" came a yell from the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Black had backed to the threshold. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government man still walked forward, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little overconfident, a little overeager to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the arrest, with his hand stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">out persuasively for Black's gun. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the silent crowd wondered if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrest were not to be made after all. Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a hunted look on his face. Then his</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression changed. Van Dorn took an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other step.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hey!" yelled an awed man. "Stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But it was too late. Even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black could not kill an unarmed man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked forward publicly with hands up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black could stop this Federal agent long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to get away, and he did. Black's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol blazed a stream of fire right into Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dora's shoulder. The roar of the shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">galvanized the room. The Government</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> man, wounded purposely, yelled and stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered. Then Black leaped backward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly Carlton jerked out his pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fired madly. The gun kicked in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. Black half turned and brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle of that deadly pistol toward him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One instant, one quiver of Black's muscles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the engineer might be in eternity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly a blast of heat and lead roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">across Carlton's face, stunning him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">making his ears*ring. The gust of fire blew</seg><seg type="columnLine">away part of the doorway and hurled Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight backward like a piece of paper in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy wind. A stream of acrid smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurred the entrance, and, when it cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, the boss, behind uhe bar, was taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">an empty shell from a shotgun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Black, lying queerly on the porch, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dead man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlton took one look and then turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, shuddering, to where Van Dora was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nursing his shoulder. The sheriff was ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching the bar with his hands up. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss jerked his thumb to somebody, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that man took the sheriff's armament away;</seg><seg type="columnLine">after which Dolan came from his trenches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and approached the suffering Van Dorn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say!" he asked. "I want to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">somethin'. This feller, Black, went into</seg><seg type="columnLine">pardnership with Finch, us in' stolen money.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's clear enough. But did Black ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a sister?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The suffering man looked reproaclrful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he gave answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never had a sister or any other rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-!" said the boss ruefully.

A yell greeted him. Dan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolan, a little more gray-haired, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from behind the bar and extended a hairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">paw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Congratulations!" he roared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he turned to the assembled crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">and held up his hand like a prize-fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">announcer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gents, one and aJI!" he shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shake hands with Harry Carlton, new</seg><seg type="columnLine">member of the County Board of Super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visors from Mirage!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They shook hands--prospectors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">miners, ranchers and grain-buvers, engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neers and laborers, until finally Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke away from them and dragged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss into the rear of his greatly enlarged</seg><seg type="columnLine">store, where there was more privacy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, she's all over," he said, perching</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a counter and accepting one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly cigars. "I owe it to you, Dolan, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so does the county. I want to thank you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boss waved it away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It wasn't me," he demurred.

"Let us get on with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">business. I am sick to death of it.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know what the consequences of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a charge usually are.

"Now',</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is it to be?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused, and the girl's wan cheeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the color of lead. She moistened her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips once or twice with her tongue; beads</seg><seg type="columnLine">of perspiration appeared at the roots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hair.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with the pale eyes rose and pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chair away.

Neither the commissary nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl appeared to interest him further.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was just gazing out of the window'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other was still sprawiing beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk, liis large, coarse hand--how different</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands were--w'as beating a devil's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatoo upon the arm of his chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     AFTER a fewr minutes Lucile made</seg><seg type="columnLine">iinufl a Solent effort to compose herself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped the moisture from her pallid</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead and dried the tears wrhich still</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung upon her lashes. Then she rose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her chair and walked resolutely up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will write the letter," she said simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lebel gave a snort of satisfaction, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other did not move from his position</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the window. The boy, Etienne, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered a cry of passionate protest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do not give M. le Marquis away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lucile!" he said hotly. "I am not afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">to die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Lucile had made up her mind.

She and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Etienne and poor father gone, and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">young ones in one of those awful Houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Correction, wrhere children were taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hate the Church, to shun the Sacraments</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to blaspheme God!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What am I to write?" she asked dully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resoluteh" closing her ears against her</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother's protest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lebel pushed pen, ink and paper toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and she sat down ready to begin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Write!" now came in a curt command</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the man at the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Lucile wrote at his dictation:</seg><seg type="columnLine">MONSEECR LE M.-VRQCIS:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We are in grave trouble.

You alone can save us, SI lc</seg><seg type="columnLine">MarquisI I beg you on my knees to do it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizen commissary here says that you have in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your possession certain papers which are of great</seg><seg type="columnLine">value to the state and that, if I can persuade you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give these up, Etienne, father and I and 'the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little ones will be left unmolested. M. le Marquis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you once said that you could never adequately</seg><seg type="columnLine">repay my poor father for all his devotion in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">service.

She buried her face in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and sobbed convulsively. The chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren were silent, awed and subdued--tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, too. Only fitienne's dark eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed upon liis sister with a look of mute</seg><seg type="columnLine">reproach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lebel had made no attempt to interrupt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flow of liis colleagues dictation. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">once or twice did a hastily smothered</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What die -!" of astonishment escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips. Now, when the letter was finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">and duly signed, he drew it to him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strewed the sand over it. Chauveiin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more impassive than ever, was once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing out of the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How are the ci-devant aristos to get this</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter?" die commissary asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It must be put in the hollow tree which</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands by the side of the stable gate at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montorgueil,', whispered Lucile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the aristos will find it there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes.

"Citizen Montorgueil, father</seg><seg type="columnLine">and son--that's all they are! And as such</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'll walk up in state to make their bow</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mine, la Guillolinel"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May We go now?" stammered Lucile</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirough her tears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lebel nodded in assent, and the girl rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned to walk toward the door. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to the children, and the little ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">clustered round her skirts like chicks</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the mother hen. Only fitienne</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained aloof, wradiful against his sister</seg><seg type="columnLine">for what he deemed her treachery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Women have no sense of honor!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered to himself with all the pride of</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious manhood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Lucile felt more than ever like a bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">who is vainly trying to evade the clutches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a fowler. She gathered the two little</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones around her. Then, with a cry like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wounded doe, she ran quickly out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg><seg type="columnLine">AS SOON as the sound of the chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren's footsteps had died away</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the corridor, Lebel turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a grunt to his sdll silent companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now, Citizen Chauveiin," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly, "perhaps you will be good enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain what is the meaning of all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomfoolery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '•Tomfoolery, citizen?" queried the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">blandly. "What tomfoolery, pray?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, about those papers!" growled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lebel savagely. "Cui^e you for an inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fering busybody!

I could have made the girl give</seg><seg type="columnLine">up their hiding-place pretty soon without</seg><seg type="columnLine">any help from you. What right had you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to interfere, I should like to know?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know quite well what right I had.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Citizen Lebel," replied Chauveiin with</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect composure. "The right conferred</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me by the Committee of Public</seg><seg type="columnLine">Safety, of whom I am sdll an unworthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">member. They sent me down here to lend</seg><seg type="columnLine">you a hand in an investigarion which is of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave importance to them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know that!" retorted Lebel sulkily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But why have you invented the story of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the papers?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is no invention, citizen," rejoined</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chauveiin with slow emphasis. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers do exist. They are in the possession</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ci-dcvaut Montorgueils, father and</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. To capture the two aristos would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only a blunder but also criminal folly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless we can lay hands on the papers at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what in Satan's name are those</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers?" ejaculated Lebel with a fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">oath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think, Citizen Lebel! Think!" was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chauvelin's cool rejoinder. "Metliinks you</seg><seg type="columnLine">might arrive at a pretty shrewd guess."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as the other's bluster and bounce</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly collapsed under his colleague's</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm, accusing gaze, the latter continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">with impressive deliberation:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The papers which the two aristos have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Needs Must</seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their possession, citizen, are receipts for</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, for bribes paid to various members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Committee of Public Safety by royal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ist agents for the overthrow of our glorious</seg><seg type="columnLine">republic. You know all about them, do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Chauvelin spoke, a look of furtive</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror had crept into Lebel's eyes; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">checks became the color of lead. But even</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he tried to keep up an air of incredulity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I?" he exclaimed. "What do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean, Citizen Chauvelin? What should</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some of those receipts are signed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">your name, Citizen Lebel," riposted Chau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velin forcefully. "Bah!" he added, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone of savage contempt crept into his even,</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm voice now. "Henriot, Foucquier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ducros and the whole gang of you are in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it up to the neck: trafficking with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies, trading with England, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">bribes from every quarter for working</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the safety' of the republic. Ah,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I had my way, I would let the hatred</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those aristos take its course. I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">let the Montorgueils and the whole pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of royalist agents publish those infamous</seg><seg type="columnLine">proofs of your treachery and of your base-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness to the entire world, and send the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of you to the guillotine!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had spoken with so much concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated fury and the hatred and contempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed in his pale eyes were so fierce,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that an involuntary ice-cold shiver ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the length of Lebel's spine. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">even so he would not give in; he tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneer and to keep up something of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">former surly defiance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bah!" he exclaimed, and with a lower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing glance he gave hatred for hatred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt for contempt. "What can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do? An I am not mistaken, there is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more discredited man in France today</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the unsuccessful tracker of the Scarlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pimpernel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The taunt went home. It was Chauve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin's turn now to lose countenance, to pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lips. The glow of virtuous indig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation died out of his eyes; his look became</seg><seg type="columnLine">furtive and shamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are right, Citizen Lebel," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly after a while. "Recriminations be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween us are out of place. I am a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credited man, as you say. Perhaps it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been better if the Committee</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sent me long ago to expiate my failures</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the guillotine. I should at least not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have suffered, as I am suffering now, daily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hourly, humiliation at thought of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph of an enemy whom I hate with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">passion that consumes my very soul. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not let us speak of me," he went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. "There are graver affairs at</seg><seg type="columnLine">stake just now than mine own."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lebel said nothing more for the moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps he was satisfied at the success of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his taunt, even though the terror within</seg><seg type="columnLine">his craven soul still caused the cold shiver</seg><seg type="columnLine">to course up and down his spine. Chauvelin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had once more turned to the window;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gaze was fixed upon the distance far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The window gave on the north. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, in a straight line, lay Calais, Boulogne,</seg><seg type="columnLine">England--where he had been made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffer such bitter humiliation at the hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his elusive enemy. Far out to the west</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay Nantes, the scene of his latest defeat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and immediately before him was Paris,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the very walls seemed to echo that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocking laugh of the daring Englishman</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would haunt him even to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Lebel, unnerved by his colleague's silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke in gruffly at last:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well then, citizen," he said with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble attempt at another sneer, "if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not thinking of sending us all to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guillotine just yet, perhaps you will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">good enough to explain just how the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fairly simply, alas!" replied Chauvelin</seg><seg type="columnLine">dryly. "The two Montorgueils, father</seg><seg type="columnLine">and son, under assumed names, were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">royalist agents who succeeded in suborning</seg><seg type="columnLine">men such as you, citizen, and the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang of you.

The boy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not spoken to her since that terrible time</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent in the presence of those two awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. He had eaten no dinner, only sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowering, staring straight out before him',</seg><seg type="columnLine">from time to time throwing a look of burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing reproach upon his sister. Now, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she called to him, he tried to run away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was half-way up the stairs before she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could seize hold of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Etienne, nwn petit/" she implored as</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arms closed around his shrinking figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me go, Lucile!" the boy pleaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">obstinately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mon petit, listen to me!" she pleaded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">''All is not lost, if you will stand by me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All is lost, Lucile!" Etienne cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striving t^&gt; keep back a flood of passionate</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears. "Honor is lost. Your treachery</seg><seg type="columnLine">lias disgraced us all. If M. k Marquis and</seg><seg type="columnLine">M. le Viconik are brought to the guillotine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their blood will be upon our heads."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Upon mine alone, my little Etienne,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said sadly. "But God alone can judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. It was a terrible alternative: M. le</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marquis--or you and Valentine and little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Josephine and poor father, who is so help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less! But don't let us talk of it all. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not lost, I am sure. The last time that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I spoke with M. k Marquis--it was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">February* do you remember?--he was full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hope and, oh, so kind! Well, he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me then that, if ever I or any of us here</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in such grave trouble that we did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know where to turn, one of us was to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">on our very oldest clothes, look as like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">barefooted beggar as we could and then go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Paris to a place called the Cabaret de la</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liberte, in the Rue Christine. There we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are to ask for the Citizen Rateau. and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are to tell him all our troubles, whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are. Well, we are in such trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, tnon petit, that we don't know where</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn. Put on the very oldest clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">little one, and run barefooted into Paris,</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the Citizen Rateau and tell him just</seg><seg type="columnLine">what has happened: the letter which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have forced me to write, the threats</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they held over me if I did not write</seg><seg type="columnLine">it--everything. Dost hear?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Already the boy's eyes were glowing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thought that he individually could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to retrieve the awful shame of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sister's treachery spurred him to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tivity. It needed no persuasion on Lucile's</seg><seg type="columnLine">part to induce him to go. She made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">put on some old clothes and stuffed a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bread and cheese into his breeches</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was close upon eight kilometers to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris, but that run was one of the happiest</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Etienne had ever made. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it barefooted, too, feeling neither fatigue</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor soreness, despite the hardness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Needs Must</seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg><seg type="columnLine">road after a three weeks' drought which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had turned mud into hard cakes and ruts</seg><seg type="columnLine">into fissures which tore the lad's feet till</seg><seg type="columnLine">they bled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not reach the Cabaret de la</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liberte till nightfall, and, when he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, he hardly dared to enter. The filth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the squalor, the hoarse voices which rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that cellar-like place below the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the street repelled the country-bred lad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Were it not for the desperate urgency of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">errand, he never would have dared to enter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As it was, the fumes of alcohol and steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, dirty clothes nearly choked him. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could scarcely stammer the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Citizen Rateau when a gruff voice present-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly demanded his purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He realized now how tired he was and</seg><seg type="columnLine">how hungry. He had not thought to pause</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to consume the small provision of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bread and cheese with which thoughtful</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lucile had provided him. Now he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to faint when a loud guffaw, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoed from one end of the horrible place</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other, greeted his timid request.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Citizen Rateau!" the same gruff voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">called out hilariously. "Why, there he is!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, citizen! There's a blooming aristo</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Etienne turned his weary eyes to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner which was being indicated to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There he saw a huge creature sprawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">across a bench, his long, powerful limbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched out before him. Citizen Rateau</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clothed rather than dressed in a soiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt, ragged breeches and tattered stock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, with shoes down at heel and a faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson cap. His face looked congested</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sunken about the eyes; he appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be asleep, for stertorous breathing came</seg><seg type="columnLine">at intervals from between his parted lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every now and then a racking cough</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to tear at his broad chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Etienne gave him one look, shuddering</seg><seg type="columnLine">with horror despite himself at the aspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this bloated wretch from whom salvation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to come. The whole place seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him hideous' and loathsome in the extreme.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What it all meant he could not understand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All that he knew was that this seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like another hideous trap into which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Lucile had fallen and that he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">fly from it--fly at all costs, before he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trayed M. le Marquis still further to these</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink-sodden brutes. Another moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he feared that he might faint. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">din of a bibulous song rang in his ears; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reek of alcohol turned him giddy and sick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had only just enough strength to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and totter back into the open. There his</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses reeled; the lights in the houses oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site began to dance wildly before his eyes--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he remembered nothing more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE is nothing now in the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">countryside quite so desolate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forlorn as the chateau of Montor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gueil, with its once magnificent park, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">overgrown with weeds, its encircling walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken dow-n, its terraces devastated and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its stately gates rusty and tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just by the side of what was known in</seg><seg type="columnLine">happier times as the stable gate there stands</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hollow tree. It is not inside the park but</seg><seg type="columnLine">just outside, and it shelters the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">lane which skirts the park walls against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blaze of the afternoon sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Its beneficent • shade is a favorite spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an afternoon siesta, for there is a bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">green sward under the tree and all along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side of the road. But, as the shades</seg><seg type="columnLine">of evening gather in, the lane is usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted, shunned by the neighboring</seg><seg type="columnLine">peasantry on account of its eery loneliness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so different from the former bustle which</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to reign around the park gates when</seg><seg type="columnLine">M. le Marquis and his family were still in</seg><seg type="columnLine">residence. Nor does the lane lead any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, for it is a mere loop which gives</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the main road at either end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henri de Montorgueil chose a peculiarly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark night early in September for one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">periodical visits to the hollow tree. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">close on nine o'clock when he passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealthily down the feme, keeping close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the park wall. A soft rain was falling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first since the prolonged drought, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it made the road heavy and slippery</seg><seg type="columnLine">in places, it helped to deaden the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the young man's furtive footsteps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air, except for the patter of the rain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was absolutely still. Henri de Montor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gueil paused from time to time with neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">craned forward, even' sense on the alert,</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening like any poor, hunted beast for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest sound which might betray</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approach of danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As many a time before he reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollow tree in safety, felt for and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the usual place the letter which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfortunate girl, Lucile, had written to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then with it in his hand he turned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">stable gate. It had long since ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be kept locked and bared. Pillaged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ransacked by order of the Committee of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Public Safety, there was nothing left inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the park walls worth keeping under lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and key.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henri slipped stealthily through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gates and made his way along the drive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every stone, every nook and cranny of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his former home was familiar to him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned into a shed where in former times</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheelbarrows and garden tools were wont</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be kept. Now it was full of debris,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumber of every sort. A more safe or</seg><seg type="columnLine">secluded spot could not be imagined.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henri crouched in the farthermost corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shed. Then from his belt he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached a small dark lantern, opened its</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutter and with the aid of the tiny, dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">light read the contents of the letter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long while after that he remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite still--as still as a man who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">received a stunning blow-on the head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">has partis lost consciousness. The blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">was indeed a staggering one. Lucile Cla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">met te, with the invincible power of her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">helplessness, was demanding the surrender</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a weapon which had been a safeguard</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Montorgueils all this while. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers which compromised a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">influential members of the Committee of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Public Safety had been the most perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms of defense against persecution and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoliation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now these were to be given up. Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there could be no question of that! Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">before consulting with his father, Henri</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that the papers would have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">given up. They were clever, those revo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutionaries. The thought of holding inno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent children as hostages could only have</seg><seg type="columnLine">originated in minds attuned to the villainies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of devils. But it was unthinkable that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">children should suffer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a while the young man roused</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself from the torpor into which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenness of this awful blow had plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. By the light of the lantern he</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribbled a few words on a scrap of paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom from his pocketbook.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My rear Loctle:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As you say, our debt to your father and to you all</seg><seg type="columnLine">never could he adequately repaid. You and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">children shall never suffer whilst we have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power to save*you. You will find the papers in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the receptacle you know of inside the chimney</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what used to by my mother's boudoir. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will find the receptacle unlocked. One day before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the term you name I myself will place the papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for you. With them my father and I do give</seg><seg type="columnLine">up our lives to save you and the little ones from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the persecution of those fiends. May the good</seg><seg type="columnLine">God guard you all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He signed the letter with his initials,</seg><seg type="columnLine">H. de M. Then he crept back to the gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dropped the message into the hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A quarter of an hour later Henri de</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montorgueil was wending his way back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the hiding-place which had sheltered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and his father for so long. Silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and darkness soon held undisputed sway</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more around the hollow tree. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rain had ceased its gentle pattering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From far away came the sound of a church</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell striking the hour of ten. Then nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few more minutes of absolute silence;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then something dark and furtive began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move out of the long grass which bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered the roadside--something that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement was almost like a snake. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged itself along close to the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making no sound as it moved. Soon it</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the hollow tree, rose to the height</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man and flattened itself against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree trunk. Then it put out a hand, felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the hollow receptacle and groped for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the missive which Henri de Montorgueil</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dropped in there a while ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next moment a tiny ray of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed through the darkness like a star.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A small, almost fragile figure of a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in the mud-stained clothes of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">country yokel, had turned up the shutter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a small lantern. Bv its flickering light</seg><seg type="columnLine">he deciphered the letter which Henri de</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montorgueil had written to Lucile Clamette.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"One day before the term you name</seg><seg type="columnLine">I myself will place the papers there for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sigh of satisfaction, quickly suppressed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came through his thin, colorless lips, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light of the lantern caught the flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">of triumph in his pale, inscrutable eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the light was extinguished. Im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrable darkness swallowed up that</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender, mysterious figure again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg><seg type="columnLine">SIX days had gone by since Chauveiin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had delivered his cruel "either--or"</seg><seg type="columnLine">to poor little Lucile Clamette; three</seg><seg type="columnLine">since he had found Henri de Montorgueils</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply to the girl's appeal in the hollow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Needs Must</seg><seg type="columnLine">5i</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tree. Since then he had made a careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigation of the chateau, and soon he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able to settle it in his own mind as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which room had been the boudoir of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame la Marquise in the past. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small apartment, having direct access</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the first landing of the staircase, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one window gave on the rose garden at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of the house. Inside the monu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental hearth, at an arm's length up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide chimney, a receptacle had been con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trived in the brickwork, with a small iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">door which opened and closed with a secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring. Chauvelin, whose nefarious calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">had rendered him proficient in such mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters, had soon mastered the workings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that spring. He could now open and close</seg><seg type="columnLine">the iron door at will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up to a late hour on the sixth night of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this weary waiting the receptacle inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chimney was still empty. That night</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chauvelin had determined to spend at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chateau. He could not have rested else-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even his colleague, Lebel, could not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the possession of those papers would</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean to the discredited agent of the Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittee of Public Safety. With them in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, he could demand rehabilitation;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could purchase immunity from those</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneers which had been so galling to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrogant soul--sneers which had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and more marked, more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">unendurable, above all, more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">menacing as he piled up failure on failure</seg><seg type="columnLine">with every encounter with the Scarlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pimpernel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immunity and rehabilitation! This #ould</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that he could once more measure</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wits and his power with that audacious</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy who had brought about his downfall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In Lhe name of Satan, bring us those</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers!" Robespierre himself had cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">vyith unwonted passion ere he sent him out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this important mission. "None of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stand the scandal of such disclosures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would mean absolute ruin for us all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Chauvelin that night, as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shades of evening had drawn in, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his stand in the chateau in the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner room which was contiguous to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boudoir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here he sat beside the open wondow for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour upon hour, his every sense on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert, listening for the first footfall upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gravel path below. Though the hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">went by leaden-footed, he was neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited nor anxious. The Clamette family</seg><seg type="columnLine">was such a precious hostage that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montorgueils were bound to comply with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lucile's demand for the papers by every</seg><seg type="columnLine">dictate of honor and of humanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "While we have those people in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">power," Chauvelin had reiterated to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self more than once during the course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his long vigil, "even that meddlesome</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scarlet Pimpernel can do nothing to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">those cursed Montorgueils."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night was dark and still. Not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath of air stirred the branches of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees or the shrubberies in the park; any</seg><seg type="columnLine">footsteps, however wary, must echo through</seg><seg type="columnLine">that perfect and absolute silence. Chauve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin's keen, pale eyes tried to pierce the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom in the direction whence in all proba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility the aristo would come. Vaguely he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if it would be Henri de Montor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gueil or the old marquis himself who would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring the papers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bah! Whichever one it is," he mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, "we can easily get the other, once</seg><seg type="columnLine">those abominable papers are in our hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, even if both Lhe aristos escape," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added menially, " 'Lis no matter, once we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the papers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far away a distant church bell struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the midnight hour. The stillness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air had become oppressive. A kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpor bom of intense fatigue lulled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terrorist's senses to somnolence. His head</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell forward on his breast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">SUDDENLY a shiver of excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment went right through him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fully awake now, with glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes wide open and the icy calm of perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence ruling every nerve. The sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stealthy footsleps had reached his ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could see nothing, either outside or</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, but his fingers felt for the pistol wrhich</seg><seg type="columnLine">he carried in his belt. The aristo was evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently alone; only one solitary footstep</seg><seg type="columnLine">was approaching the chateau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chauvelin had left ajar the door which</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave on the boudoir. The staircase was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other side of that fateful room, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door leading to that was closed. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes of tense expectancy went by.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then through the silence there came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of furtive footsteps on the stairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creaking of a loose board and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stealthy opening of the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In all liis adventurous carcer Chauvelin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never fell so calm. His heart beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite evenly, and his senses were undis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed by the slightest tingling of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves. The stealthy sounds in the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">room brought the movements of the aristo</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly clearly before his menial vision.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The latter was earning a small dark lantern.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as he entered, he flashed its light</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the room. Then he deposited the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern on the floor, close beside the hearth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started to feel up die chimney for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden receptacle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chauvelin watched him now as a cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">watches a mouse, savoring these few mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of anticipated triumph. Noiselessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pushed open the door which gave on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boudoir. By the feeble light of the lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground he could only see the vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">outline of the aristo's back, bending for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to his task, but a thrill went through</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as he saw a bundle of papers lying on</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiie ground close by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything was ready; the trap was set.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here was a complete victor)' at last. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously the young Vicomte de Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orgueil who had come to do the deed. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">head was up the chimney even now. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">old marquis's back would have looked nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rower and more fragile. Chauvelin held his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath; then he gave a sharp little cough</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took the pistol from his belt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound caused the aristo to turn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next moment a loud and merry laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">roused the dormant echoes of the old cha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teau, and a pleasant drawling voice said in</seg><seg type="columnLine">English:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am demmed if this is not my dear old</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend M. Chambertin! Zounds, sir! Who'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thought of meeting you here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had a cannon suddenly exploded at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chauvelin's feet, he would have felt less</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnerved. For the space of two heart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beats he stood there, his eyes glued on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arch-enemy, that execrated Scarlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pimpernel, whose mocking glance, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the intervening gloom, seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have deprived him of consciousness. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">that phase of helplessness only lasted for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment; the next, all the marvelous possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bilities of this encounter flashed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terrorist's keen mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything was ready. The trap was</seg><seg type="columnLine">set. The unfortunate Clamettes were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bait which now would bring a far more</seg><seg type="columnLine">noble quarry into the mesh than ever he--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chauvelin--had dared to hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   He raised his pistol, ready to fire. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">already Sir Percy Blakeney was on him,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and, with a swift movement which the other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was too weak to resist, he wrenched the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weapon from his enemy's grasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Why, how hasty you are, my dear M.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Chambertin," he said lightly. "Surely you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are not in such a hurry to put a bullet into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The position now was one which would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">liave made even a braver man than Chau-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">velin quake. He stood alone and unarmed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in face of an enemy from whom he could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">expect no mercy. But, even so, his first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thought was not of escape. He had not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only appraised his own danger but also the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">immense power which he held while the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Clamettes remained as hostages in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hands of his colleague, Lebel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You have me at a disadvantage, Sir</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Percy," he said, speaking every whit as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">coolly as his foe. " But only momentarily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You can kill me, of course, but. if 1 do not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">return from this expedition, not only safe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and sound but with a certain packet of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">papers in my hands, my colleague, Lebel,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has instructions to proceed at once against</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the girl, Clamette, and the whole family.'*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "I know that well enough." rejoined Sir</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Percy with a quaint laugh. "I know what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">* venemous reptiles you and those of your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">kidney are. You certainly do owe your life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the present moment to the unfortunate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">girl whom you are persecuting with such in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">famous callousness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Chauvelin drew a sigh of relief. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">situation was shaping itself more to his sat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">isfaction already. Through the gloom he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could vaguely discern the Englishman's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">massive form standing a few paces away,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one hand buried in his breeches pocket, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other still holding t he pistol. On the ground</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">close by the hearth was the small lantern,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and in its dim light the packet of papers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gleamed white and tempting in the dark-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ness. Chauvelin's keen eyes had fastened</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on it and saw the form of receipt for money</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with Henriot's signature, which he recog-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nized. on the top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He himself had never felt so calm. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only thing he could regret was that he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alone. Half a dozen men now, and this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">impudent foe could indeed be brought to his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knees. And this time there would be no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">risks taken, no chances for escape. Some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">how it seemed to Chauvelin as if something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Scarlet Pimpernel's audacity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Needs Must</seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg><seg type="columnLine">foresight had gone from him. As he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, looking broad and physically power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, there was something wavering and unde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided in his attitude, as if the edge had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken off his former recklessness and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiasm. He had brought the compromis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing papers here and had no doubt helped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montorgueils to escape. But, while Lucile</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clamette and her family were under the eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Lebel, no amount of impudence could</seg><seg type="columnLine">force a successful bargaining.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS Chauveiin now w'ho ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared the more keen and the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert. The Englishman seemed un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided what to do next and remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent, toying with the pistol. He even</seg><seg type="columnLine">smothered a yawn. Chauveiin saw his op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity. With the quick movement of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat pouncing upon a mouse, he stooped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized that packet of papers and would then</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there have made a dash for the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them; only that, as he seized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">packet, the string which held it together</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave way, and the papers were scattered all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Receipts for money? Compromising let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters? No! Blank sheets of paper, all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them--all except the one which had lain</seg><seg type="columnLine">tantalizingly on the top--the one receipt</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed by Citizen Henriot. Sir Percy</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed lightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you really think, my good friend,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "that I would be such a demmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool as to place my best wreapon so readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your hand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your best weapon, Sir Percy?" retorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chauveiin with a sneer. "What use is it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you while we hold Lucile Clamette?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "While I hold Lucile Clamette, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean, my dear M. Chambertin," riposted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blakeney with elaborate blandness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You hold Lucile Clamette? Bah! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">defy you to drag a whole family like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of our clutches. The man a cripple, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">children helpless! And you think they can</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape our vigilance when all our men are</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned! How do you think they are going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get across the river, Sir Percy, when every</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge is closely watched? How will they</seg><seg type="columnLine">get across Paris when at every gate our men</seg><seg type="columnLine">are on the lookout for them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They can't do it, my dear M. Cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bertin," rejoined Sir Percy blandly, "else</seg><seg type="columnLine">I were not here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as Chauveiin--fuming, irritated</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite himself as he always was when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountered that impudent Englishman--</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged his shoulders in token of contempt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blakeney's powerful grasp suddenly clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us understand one another, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">good M. Chambertin," he said coolly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Those unfortunate Clamettes, as you say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are too helpless and too numerous to</seg><seg type="columnLine">smuggle across Paris with any chance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">success. Therefore I look to you to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">them under your protection. They are all</seg><seg type="columnLine">stowed away comfortably at this moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a conveyance wiiich I have provided for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. That conveyance is waiting at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge-head now. We could not cross with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out your help; we could not get across Paris</seg><seg type="columnLine">without your august presence and your tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">color scarf of office. So you are coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us, my dear M. Chambertin," he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued, and, with force which was quite ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistible, he began to drag his enemy after</seg><seg type="columnLine">him toward the door. "You are going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sit in that conveyance with the Clamettes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I myself will have the honor to drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. And at every bridge-head you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">show your pleasing countenance and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarf of office to the guard and demand free</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage for yourself and your family, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">representative member of the Committee of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Public Safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then we'll enter Paris by the Porte</seg><seg type="columnLine">d'lvry and leave it by the Balignolles, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere your charming presence will lull</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guards' suspicions to rest.

At</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon tomorrow, without a moment's grace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, wrho has the</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers in his possession, will dispose of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he thinks best unless I myself claim</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While he spoke, he continued to drag his</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy along with him with an assurance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an impudence which was past belief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chauveiin wras trying to collect his thoughts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whirl of conflicting plans wrere running</seg><seg type="columnLine">riot in his mind.

He could not bring himself to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve that he had been so completely foiled--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this impudent adventurer had him</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more in the hollow of liis hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the name of Satan, bring us back</seg><seg type="columnLine">those papers!" Robespierre had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded, and now he--Chauvelin--was left</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a maze of doubt, and the vita! alterna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive was hammering in his brain, ''The Scar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let Pimpernel--or those papers." Which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Satan's name, was the more important?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Passion whispered, "The Scarlet Pimper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel!" But common sense and the fuLure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his party, the whole future of the Revolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion mayhap, demanded those compro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mising papers. And all the while he fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed that relentless enemy through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenues of the park and down the lonely</seg><seg type="columnLine">lane. Overhead the trees of the forest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sucy, nodding in a gentle breeze, seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mock his perplexity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had not arrived at a definite decision</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrhen the river came in sight and a carriage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantem threw a shaft of dim light through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mist-laden air. Now* he felt as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in a dream. He was thrust unresist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into a closed chaise, wherein he felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of several other people--children</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an old man wrho was muttering cease-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly. As in a dream he answered ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions at the bridge to a guard wrhom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know me: Armand Chauvelin, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Committee of Public Safety!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As in a dream he heard the curt w'ords of</seg><seg type="columnLine">command--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pass on, in the name of the republic!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And all the while the thought hammered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his brain:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something must be done! This is im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible! This can not be! It is not I--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chauvelin--who am sitting here, helpless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unresisting. It is not that impudent Scarlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pimpernel who is sit ting there before me on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the box, driving me to utter humilia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion!''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet it was all true. All real. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clamette children w'ere sitting in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, clinging to Lucile, terrified of him even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. The old man was beside him--im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">becile and ununderstanding. The boy, Et-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iennc, was up on the box next to that auda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious adventurer, whose broad back ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to Chauvelin like a rock on which all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hopes and dreams must forever be</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chaise rattled triumphantly through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Batignolles. It was then broad day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. A brilliant early Autumn day after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rains. The sun, the keen air, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocked Chauvclin's helplessness, his hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliation. Long before noon they passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. Denis. Here the chaise turned ofF</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main road, halted at a small wayside</seg><seg type="columnLine">house--nothing more than a cottage. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">which everything seemed more dreamlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever. All that Chauvelin remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered of it afterward was that he was once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more alone m a room with his enemy, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had demanded his signature to a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe-conducts ere he finally handed over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">packet of papers to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do I know' that they are all here?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard himself vaguely muttering while</seg><seg type="columnLine">his trembling fingers handled that precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">packet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's just it!" his tormentor retorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">airily. "You don't know.

It lay at the narrow end of Break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck Gorge, the upper end of which em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">braced the isolated freak of a house known</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Cragcastle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lawyer Osborne had told me his recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">deceased client, John Maxon, had built</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house. And, in truth, its remoteness</seg><seg type="columnLine">matched well with that ecc'entric provision</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his will which had caused me, a stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">to everybody concerned, to take up a soli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary residence in Cragcastle. And which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a consequence, gave me the novel expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rience, on the first night of my stay there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sitting across the table from a visitor</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom I had just admitted and of whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew absolutely nothing--except that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to kill me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As soon as I read of your father's will,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said this stranger, "I knew I had you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was and was not a man of pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessing appearance. Superficially, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was handsome--well-formed, well-dressed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the late forties, with quite regular fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures. A closer look, however, showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had a coldly sensual mouth and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutal jaw and that liis eyes were bloodshot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crookdom and the underworld know such</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces well; they are the natural result of</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of vice and vicious profiteering</seg><seg type="columnLine">working upon unusual intelligence as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">basis. In my own person I should probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have known this man well enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had him for an enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your father probably figured," he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, "that, if you were a coward, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't come back, and, if you changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a man of passable courage, fit to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">his son, you would. That was where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a mistake. You came back, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still you're a coward.

True, the room in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we sat contained little else than our two</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs and the old oak table on which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ordered me--somewhat to my amuse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment--to keep my hands. But that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">because I'd carefully denuded it of every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else--sofas, chairs and the like--</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he came in. Even while he urged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the masquerade on me. Osborne had very</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnestly warned me against personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger, and I wanted to make quite sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, if I had a caller, we should sit where</seg><seg type="columnLine">we did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Really, Cragcastle was a fine rambling--</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rather climbing--old country house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite comfortably supplied, even to a tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone and electric light and heat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rogues' End</seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I suppose Hardridge, as my visitor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had named himself, referred mainly to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolation, perched as it was five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards up the seaward slope of Mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tamalpais, five miles from the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">village and four from the nearest house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I replied that he was hard to please,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the setting couldn't be beaten for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And indeed Hardridge seemed outwardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have every chance of accomplishing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention. We both believed we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone in the house; he had also made</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain that I carried no weapon, and Ire</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself held an effective-looking revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a clearly efficient hand. But he rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hand on the table, with the gun pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">only in my general direction; so I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have concluded the scene at any moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, I didn't want to check him yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there being too much I wanted to know to</seg><seg type="columnLine">let slip a chance for knowledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On his part, up to now Hardridge had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been enjoying himself perfectly well in</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloating over my supposed helplessness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Assassins are usually rhetoricians as well--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which fact has saved many lives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "However," I added, "I'll probably be</seg><seg type="columnLine">as comiortable as you, dead or alive.

You'll either hang</seg><seg type="columnLine">or go to San Quentin-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that last word Hardridge's face went</seg><seg type="columnLine">livid. His revolver flashed up, and for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant I thought we were both dead men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "- you." he cried--it was his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of real passion--"cut that. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you dare-''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For a longer term than I caused you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get last time," I went on steadily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That'll be some consolation to my ghost."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Few men will fire in the middle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another man's sentence; that was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason I completed mine. But there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">another reason, too. His outburst par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tially confirmed a suspicion certain of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarks and certain things in his appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given me--that he had been in prison</seg><seg type="columnLine">and believed I had sent him there, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to prove or disprove it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You see, I hadn't yet learned why he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to kill me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You think so," he rasped, lowering his</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver. "Well, you'll not have that</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort. Those of the ring that are left</seg><seg type="columnLine">are back of me in this, and they'll see me</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. Because you're a traitor doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove all men are. Because I trusted you</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't prove I'm altogether a fool, either.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My getaway is safe.

My pro rain in that pool you</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole didn't break me bv a long shot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it did break most of the others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, John Maxon, it's not prison but life</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's ahead of me--life!" he exulted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And for you, deaLh and the fishes! For</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll drop you into the bay; I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison the earth with you. Pah!

As for the smooth-talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawyer, Osborne, who'd drawn me into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair and got me to come to Cragcastle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd really said nothing about Hardridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">but only warned me against danger in</seg><seg type="columnLine">general.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anyway, I placed little confidence in</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyUiing Osborne had told me. His ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of candor had been too perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be genuine. I've learned to beware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the confessed rascal who looks me straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the eye--there's always some other</seg><seg type="columnLine">deviltry hidden behind his confession.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This, I was sure, was Osborne's case.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although the will itself--John Maxon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sr.'s, disposing of Cragcastle and the rest oi</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Maxon estate--was evidently genuine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Osborne had calmly proposed to me. a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger, a plan involving false impersona-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, perjury, theft and perhaps a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">other violations of the law. Profit, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty thousand each. I couldn't pick out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unsound spots in his proposal, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he wasn't a man wrho would be content</seg><seg type="columnLine">to divide such profits evenly. Naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wanted to see what was behind his</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposal, and a week must necessarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">elapse before I could sail on my own busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness; so I came in with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I came the more readily since I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">I really needed some amusment to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind off the absorbing problem into</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I would presently plunge It can</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly be hinted at in the present con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nection, but, if you remember that throne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattering society, the Ko Lao Hui, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">part it played in die Chinese revolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the part it would have played had its</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous leader, Koshinga, lived, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll know what it meant when the word</seg><seg type="columnLine">was passed to a few of us that Koshinga</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not died. Or, rather, that a eertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had arisen in China who claimed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be Koshinga. China has been my hobby</seg><seg type="columnLine">for years--anti in face of this rumor I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">chained to San Francisco for a week.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, to return, within twenty-four hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">after meeting Osborne I took up my solitary</seg><seg type="columnLine">residence in Cragcastle, which was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar punishment, test or merely eccen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric requirement imposed by the senior</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon's will upon his only son and heir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At ten o'clock of my first evening there</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osborne's warning of immediate danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been substantiated. In answer to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knock, 1 had opened the door, and Hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge had thrust his revolver against my</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To his desire to punish before killing, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">view my writhing soul as weli as my writh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing body, I probably owed my life. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd disappointed him in the first respect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I felt he would soon seek the ultimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're far from complimentary," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Crook, coward, traitor--well, maybe I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">all three. -But you haven't yet accused</seg><seg type="columnLine">me of being a fool, and a fool I'd certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">be if I came and played with death in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">house without seeing to my cards. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">would a coward sit in such a game quite as</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly as I'm sitting unless he was sui'e</seg><seg type="columnLine">he held the winning hand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could tell by the violence of his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joinder that these two questions had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubling him all along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A cur like you--" he began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't feel like enduring any more;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I raised my right hand, that had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted from its first position on the table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short three inches. The movement/-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught his attention, and his eyes shifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the taut string that extended downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my closed hand, and disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a hole in the top of the table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">AND the sentence he had begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">died on his lips. It was inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esdng to note how, like a weakening</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow, uncertainty flitted over his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's no threat so unnerving as a mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Puzzling, isn't it?

"You mav leave when vou</seg><seg type="columnLine">like."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I picked his revolver up, glanced at it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leveled it at him and arose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But next time--" I hinted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Next time," he grated harshly, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">get no chance for monkey-shines'"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks!" I said. "Good night!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got to his feet slowly and turned away</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, glaring at me the while and plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">loath' to go. The fury that was in his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fixed hatred that smoldered behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, told me what a dangerous enemy I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosing. And no wonder. For it was I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rogues' End</seg><seg type="columnLine">59</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to his evident belief, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreaked havoc upon his life and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demned him to years of solitary brooding</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a prison cell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I recalled with an inward grimace how</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osborne had shaken hands with me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning and wished me well, knowing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he must have known, that I was marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the vengeance of this man. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance had he really-felt there was that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would ever see me again? Or had it really</seg><seg type="columnLine">been his belief--and possibly his hope--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I'd kill Hardridge instead? Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">thread of the tangle went back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">central mystery of Osborne's purpose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remembered that I had had to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">some proof* of my ability to take care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself in a pinch before Osborne would</seg><seg type="columnLine">open negotiations with me at all. Surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">that indicated no desire to furnish Hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge with a victim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mystified as I was, however, I think I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not permit Hardridge to guess it, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was with an intent to carry the tiling off</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly that I said to liim--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''I suppose you'll haunt the house like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">specter and all that sort of thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By -, you know I will," he shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">viciously over his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Letting him go was really taking a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyer in Death, Limited, and I knew it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then happened the second peculiar thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the night. Just as Hardridge put out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand to open the door, in the silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">following the cessation of our footsteps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard unmistakably the sound of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one else moving in the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was difficult to believe, for early in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon I had carefully barred all</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors and windows. It could hardly be</seg><seg type="columnLine">an accomplice of Hartridge, but, to cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound from him, I asked him if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">another gun and ran my hand over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets. His snarl at my touch was like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild beast's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you may need this one," I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I pushed him out into the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, as I closed the door upon him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I	flung his revolver after him. The act</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, I think, based upon sound strategic</seg><seg type="columnLine">principles. It would be very easy for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get another gun but very difficult to forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">my carelessness as to whether he had one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, the moment the key was turned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lock, I wiiirled and darted across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. The inner door of the room opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a hall that ran the length of the house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I passed through that door and was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cross the hall into the parlor opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">when another sound decided me. I ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hall and through the first door</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the left into the library, which adjoined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parlor to the rear. After fumbling for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment for the electric light switch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I finally found it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I'd been prepared for strange things when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I came to Cragcastle. Indeed, the remote-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and solitude of its setting, surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by miles of black rock and chaparral-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered mountainside, save to the east,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the water eternally beat and lapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">against its foundations, gave the house an</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of being fashioned for mystery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and framed in it. And my interview with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardridge had been sufficiently remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have prepared me for almost anything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevertheless, I admit my credulity was</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A woman's figure flashed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway that led back into the parlor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door slammed shut behind her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was in no gentle mood that I pursued</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Remember, to me she was at best a</seg><seg type="columnLine">housebreaker, and I suppose my nerves</seg><seg type="columnLine">were somewhat tense and jumpy, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She got into the hall before I caught her arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a grip that must have hurt, and I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid it was with scant courtesy that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew her back into the parlor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, once there and the Tights turned on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I like to remember I released her quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I beg your pardon, miss," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT'S been a saving principle of mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">to apply as little thought as possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to feminine beauty. This from,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hope, no innate lack of appreciation in</seg><seg type="columnLine">me--but I'll omit self-analysis and simplv</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that it was something more than beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made me instinctively apologize to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intruder. Character was stamped on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensitive yet sanely strong and sensible</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Whatever the reason for her presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Cragcastle, it could not be a guilty</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, and suddenly I felt guilty under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing wrath of her clear blue eyes. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the unveiled contempt in them, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as hard to endure as it was, for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, when she spoke, I understood it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least in part.</seg><seg type="columnLine">6o</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Cousin John," with icy bitterness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"what are you going to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She, too, like Hardridge, had imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately accepted me in my assumed char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acter of John Maxon. That was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural, for who else would be occupying</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cragcastle? But to be addressed by her</seg><seg type="columnLine">as "Cousin" was somewhat different. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">late John Maxon, Jr., had, according</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Osborne, no near relatives at all. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been one of Osborne's best arguments</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I might, in safety and with no great</seg><seg type="columnLine">moral guilt, lake his place. If it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lie, Osborne must have known I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">very shortly discover it. I suppose my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stare at the girl must have been quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">idiotic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you come back witless as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything else?" she asked sharply. "Can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you speak?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could see that under the surface she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was really frightened. She was trying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old device of simulating--and perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">stimulating--courage by hard words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm naturally astonished," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What are you doing here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Merely paying a cousinly call, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course." She laughed mirthlessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think you'd better answer me," I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her quietly. "This is my house; it's nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight; you've evidently gained entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">by steal til. In other words, you're in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">position of a common burglar. The fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you're my cousin will not prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">me from turning you over to the police."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose not. The tarred stick would</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacken the whole branch. The family</seg><seg type="columnLine">name-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You should have thought of that before</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking into my house." It was a rare</seg><seg type="columnLine">part, for me, playing the stem landlord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not begging," she replied tartly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do what you will. Of course, you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I'm doing here. There's only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing worth coming for--and that by</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights belongs to me, anyway. Or rather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my father. If your father hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen it----"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean? Don't say that."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He did, and you know it. It belonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to father. It w'as willed to him--all he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got out of the estate--because he was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eldest son. It's always been so, and grand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">father wouldn't break the chain even for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your father's lies. Then it disappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who could have taken it except the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who got everything else, who had every</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity--your father! Why, didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tell fa tier he had it--gloat over it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that it would never be discovered save</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his son, you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 was getting quite beyond my depth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One thing was clear, however; 1 was</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieved of all obligation toward Lawyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osborne. By his multiplied falsehoods</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had discredited once more the prettv</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedraggled saying, "Honor among thieves."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, it seemed likely I might progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster in solving the riddle if I doffed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask before this girl--in whose presence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I admit, the wearing of it had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather odious.	-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, no." I said. "I must admit all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's a riddle to me. Because, you see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm not your cousin."	•</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not my--cousin?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In her bewilderment and increased fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">she retreated a step, her hand going up as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if to ward me off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Merely an imposter," I told her as</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently as I could, "but, I assure you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a perfectly harmless one. Your cousin</seg><seg type="columnLine">being dead, 1 planned to take his place--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a day or so, and-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the middle of my stumbling half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation I observed incredulity come</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her face, part of which, I flattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, was caused by a new and swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">appraisal of me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But that's impossible," she interrupted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thank you," I said, "but it's unfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately true."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how'-- I don't understand! Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it isn't possible!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither could I understand why her</seg><seg type="columnLine">credulity had passed so swiftly into absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">disbelief. Her only question now seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be as to my motive in denying myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was unpleasant. I'm not accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to having my word doubted, and I par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly wanted to be believed by this girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So I told her as convincingly as possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in as few' words the whole story of mv</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence in Cragcastle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I'd really been brought into touch with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lawyer Osborne through a want ad.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously designed to attract every near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">respectable world tramp in San Francisco</seg><seg type="columnLine">between certain age, weight and height</seg><seg type="columnLine">limits. Osborne had quizzed me until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered that I had no acquaintances</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a thousand miles and that I appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently matched his misuse of the law</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a profound contempt for it--which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rogues' End</seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg><seg type="columnLine">incidentally, was his error. Then he'd told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that one of his clients, John Maxon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just died; that his son and only heir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Maxon, Jr., had been killed about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time in a saloon brawl in Hong</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kong; that this son had been absent</seg><seg type="columnLine">about five years, a ne'er-do-well wanderer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of the time under assumed names;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in feature and stature I bore a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong resemblance to him, and that only</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, Osborne, knew of this son's death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Osborne's proposal was, of course, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I substitute for this dead son, which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might do the more easily since a freak</seg><seg type="columnLine">provision in old man Maxon's will provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his son live alone in Cragcastle six</seg><seg type="columnLine">months before inheriting. This evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he had fled from some danger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his father wished to test his courage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthiness--but of this Osborne knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. At the end of six months my</seg><seg type="columnLine">identity as John Maxon would be easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">established--to Osborne's satisfaction, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least--and Osborne and I would split the</seg><seg type="columnLine">estate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     WHILE I was telling her this, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's expression gradually changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from incredulity to utter amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and she apparently had hard work</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep from interrupting me. At the end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after hesitating a moment, she confounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and upset my whole tale by four as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tounding words--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But John isn't dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl's confidence came slowly. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all, I had given her mine, and frank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness begets frankness. Finally, after ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently considering the matter, she went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No! At least he sailed from China</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive. Osborne himself showed me his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable at date of sailing. Then I have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter he wrote a few days before--a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief business letter. We weren't friends.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His ship reached San Francisco last Satur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then Osborne lied all around," I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. "After all, I sensed it. But, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name of reason, why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It appeared like a stiff enough problem,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I was more than ever glad I'd come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cragcastle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl continued to regard me ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">praisingly, cautiously, but I seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have leaped several points in her estimation</seg><seg type="columnLine">from legal cousin to illegal imposter--</seg><seg type="columnLine">as strong a commentary- as I'd yet had on</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Maxon's character. Nevertheless, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">still considered her apparent lack of fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">as largely brave subterfuge, and I tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to reassure her. We were both</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchers--I for the truth, she for some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing materially valuable--and, if I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">win her confidence, there might be a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mutual help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want you to believe," I told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnestly and truthfully, "that I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">intend to go through with the thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Curiosity isn't wholly a feminine vice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Maxon. I knew Osborne was lying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I wanted to see what was really in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. And he never said a word about</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. According to him, John Maxon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the only heir. I thought I'd step</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the affair without troubling any one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get out the same way. If I'd really</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to stick, would I have confessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my masquerade to you as quickly as I did?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I still think that last was a logical argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and it was to that I returned several</seg><seg type="columnLine">times during the five minutes talk that</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed. But perhaps the reason Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon finally permitted herself to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">me was that she wanted to. Perhaps she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had all the time held the idea of enlisting</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in her own search. But, when I finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the talk around to it again, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to discuss it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," she said. "It doesn't matter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shouldn't have come, anyhow. Oh, I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">go now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And she made a hurried move as if to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape into the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that I suddenly remembered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Death watched Cragcastle that night, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I stood squarely in her path, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to stir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait!" I said earnestly. "I've some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else to tell you. Something for your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own safety. Tell me first when and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">you came here and how you got into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, I walked out from the village--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mill Valiev*, I mean--this morning. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bundle of old keys and finally got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front door open. I was here when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. We had a fine game of hide-and-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek, though you didn't know it. I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd escape discovery till you went to sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then leave,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After searching a little more. I suppose.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">I supplied. "Well, you came out of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">6 2</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding-place to see if I'd settled down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-- Did you hear voices just before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I caught you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then 1 told her of my interview</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Hardridge and tried to make it clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her that it would be difficult to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cragcastle that night without stopping a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet. I argued the more convincingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">because even then, in a nebulous way, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan I later acted on was forming in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, to put it through, I must win Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon's confidence completely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My exact arguments don't matter. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway, the personal element figures mainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in matters of this kind. Any one would</seg><seg type="columnLine">find it hard to tell me why she should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have stayed in the house. And she ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted, at last, that no one would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned about her whereabouts. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was teaching in San Bernardino, had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">north during the few days of vacation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely registered at one of the San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco hotels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that she quite readily told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the object of her search in Cragcastle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd already divined that it was family</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewelry; she centered the search to a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">sapphire--a sapphire that had come down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Maxon family for many generations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">always from telder son to elder son, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Maxon, Sr., had broken the chain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was the younger of two brothers and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorite with their father. Indeed, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the other son and their parent had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come a wide estrangement--the girl gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to understand that it was through some</seg><seg type="columnLine">machination on the part of John Maxon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyway, all the family estate had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">willed to John Maxon, except only' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous sapphire--and that had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Miss Maxon was sure her uncle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Maxon, had stolen it and, being un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to dispose of it and unable to display</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, had kept it hidden all these years. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he had even boasted of the theft to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father. And she was sure it was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Cragcastle, where he had suddenly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpectedly died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was it? It seemed a fantastic tale but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not an incredible one. A great gem and</seg><seg type="columnLine">family strife--how related are the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas! And I had -- considering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proverb, "Like father, like son"--no reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think over highly of the paternal an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cestor of John Maxon, Jr. He might</seg><seg type="columnLine">easil) be a man who would steal for spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gloat over his stealings in secret. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all forms of wealth, jewels lend themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">most easily to this form of vice--as witness</seg><seg type="columnLine">history. Truly the love of jewels--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 suppose my belief in Esther Maxon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">story was very largely based on my real</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to help her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please don't think that--that it's for</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. But my father's quite ill--has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been for years. He's never had--proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">care. 1 don't make enough as a teacher,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, if we could get the sapphire and sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">it-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "1 11 get it for you/' I said. "Or 1 think</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For her tale of the sapphire had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">me the second half of the idea I needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh! How?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not by searching. We might search</seg><seg type="columnLine">a year and never find it. Your uncle had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good many years to contrive a hiding-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. But, if it's in this house, I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can get it. I'll try, anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wasn't too sure. But. if my mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">laborings had borne true fruit--if I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged accurately the character of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly resurrected John Maxon and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive in having Osborne inveigle me into</seg><seg type="columnLine">impersonating him at Cragcastle--then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For, of course, if John Maxon were alive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was the principal, Osborne only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent. I thought it quite clear, too, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should temporarily desire an understudy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the play called life. In short, I simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">took for granted the truth of Hardridge s</seg><seg type="columnLine">description of him, thought what such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man would do in such a case as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself on reading his father's will--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in such and such another case--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mapped my moves accordingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without telling her any tiling of my plan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I finally got Miss Maxon to retire for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Indeed, she was very tired. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bedrooms in the second story of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, and 1 led her to one that had strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutters over the window and confidence-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspiring bolts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I went to the cellar, got twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet of light rope and passed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house again to the front door. Taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">my revolver in my hand, I opened the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and darted through it. Hastily I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the key in the lock. Then I leaped away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the door and across the roadway</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rogues' End</seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> into a narrow trail that led through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the chaparral down the mountainside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout I made it appear that I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> rather clumsily and nervously trying to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> escape unseen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Of course, my intention was precisely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  the opposite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    I assumed that Hardridge would be as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  easily fooled in such matters as the average</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  city-bred man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       IT WAS a quite dark night. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ■j&amp;S? low, thin mist had drifted up from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the sea, and through it the light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of the stars and of a ghostly hall-moon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> filtered uncertainly. From the beginning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of the trail I looked back a scant twenty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> yards to the house and saw only a bulky</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> gray shadow. Besides that and the near-by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> chaparral I could see nothing. The light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of the string of villages from the foot of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tamalpais to the ferry passage, the inter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mittent flash of Alcatraz and even the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> white radiance that San Francisco usually</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> flings against the sky were all blotted out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> by the mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   So, although I knew that humanity,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> society and the law were all very close at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hand, it didn't seem so strange that I should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> be crouching primitively in the edge of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> brush, my nerves strung up, straining my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> senses for a sign of Hardridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Which wasn't long coming. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> chaparral crackled to my right. A cautious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> foot planted itself on the roadway--I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> judged about thirty paces lower down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were more footsteps; Hardridge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> came closer. Just when, by craning my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> neck out of the brush, I could see him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> outlined shadowily, I made a slight noise</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> with my foot. Instantly a revolver</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cracked, and the bullet hit the road a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> little beyond me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   And instantly I had turned and was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> moving cautiously--yet not so cautiously</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that Hardridge could not hear my move-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ments--down the trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardridge, of course, started in pursuit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I had intended, and--ostensibly hunted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">really hunter--I quickened my flight. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made only enough noise so that the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">. of my movements would come to Hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">| ridge's ears above the noise of his own.</seg><seg type="columnLine">f Which was really considerable. Hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge's pursuit, at once freighted by excess</seg><seg type="columnLine">of caution and hurried by hate, was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughably awkward that I knew--barring</seg><seg type="columnLine">accidents--I'd be able to accomplish at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least the first item of my plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trail here descended sharply. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">both sides the shrubbery was as thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an abandoned vineyard. Here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there low chaparral thrust arresting, thorn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tipped branches across the trail and tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my flesh and clothing. Underfoot the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground was uneven, uncertain, strewn with</seg><seg type="columnLine">small stones that were easily dislodged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with dead leaves that crackled. Still I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able in some way to control the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my passage and to move with less and</seg><seg type="columnLine">less of noise every minute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardridge was now about twenty yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me, but he was rapidly lessening</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance. Also, he was rapidly lessen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his caution. Probably the diminishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of my flight excited him with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that I was escaping. Now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I purposely broke a twig or brushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a branch so he'd know I w'as still in motion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once, straightening up. I thrust my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the chaparral. He fired, but I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducked out of sight again before his finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked the trigger. I intended the move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment to enrage him still further, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocking gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The game was, I suppose, slightly unfair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Hardridge was blinded both by passion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inexperience. But he had brought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">on himself. Besides, as things stood now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was really working toward the end Hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge himself desired. At least I so</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little farther and my flight ended.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The trail led straight on, but to the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">a narrow opening between two clumps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrubbery attracted me. I stopped oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site that opening, drew up my feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed into it. Then I picked up a pebble</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tossed it down the trail. It struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground perhaps five yards beyond where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I lay and bounced and rolled a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardridge probably believed, as I in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended he should, that the pebble had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dislodged by my foot. Anyway, he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindly 011 until I could have reached out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and touched him. There he stopped as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had sensed my nearness and was men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tally feeling for me. If it hadn't been for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his labored breatiling, he might have heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">me stir and set myself for the leap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it was, the butt of my revolver crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his forehead while he still stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">there--waiting, it seemed, for the blow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He reeled backward, and I caught him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted his arms behind his back. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only partially stunned, and he struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">feebly while I tied his wrists together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maxon! - you, Maxon!" he mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered. And, as full strength and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness came to him with* complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization of his helplessness, the strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his expletives kept pace with his growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage. Nevertheless, 1 could hardly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agree with most of his expletives as applied</seg><seg type="columnLine">to die individual whose life I'd borrowed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, while I finished binding his arms securely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his body, 1 let him talk on. Then--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why don't I kill you, dien, if I'm all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was my intention to give him a doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to start on. If I'd flatly denied being John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon, Hardridge would hardly have be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved me; besides, it wasn't in the game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was in the game that he be made</seg><seg type="columnLine">to regard that possibility--as a possibility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whyr didn't I kill you a few hours ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a few minutes or any time between?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could've, you know. As easily as I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill you now. Of course, you realize that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're really as helpless out here as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">infant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cut that, you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is unpleasant to see a man fairly sob</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rage. I suppose part of that rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at himself for being so easily trapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mastered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to gag you," I went on when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd quite finished, "take you back to die</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and lock you in a closet. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll stay all day. You'll be regularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fed; I want you to keep up your strength.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, I've a particular reason for wanting</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. In the evening you'll be unbound and</seg><seg type="columnLine">die gag removed, but you'll be still kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">in die closet--and be sure the door of it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be covered by my gun. You should know</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this time that I don't make mistakes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, why do you suppose I'm doing all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How the devil should I know? I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose you're calling in your friends, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Try again," I said. "I needn't go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that trouble to get the police. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fra merely suggesting that maybe you</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't quite plumbed this thing yet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Put your diink-tank to w'ork and try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure things out. You'll have lots of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that closet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He emitted a sound between a curse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a groan. I think he was looking forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">into those black hours when he'd be alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hatred, balked, bound and help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You d better kill me now, John Maxon,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">ne said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "John Maxon probably would," I replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then I dapped on the gag, giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that besides a new thought to chew on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was perhaps the impact of that new</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought on his brain that made him quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy to manage on thejvay back to Crag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casde.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I put him into the hall closet, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">built into the wall between the doors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dining-room and reception-room. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was small enough that he w-ould have</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically no liberty of movement even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got free from the rope; the door was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong, and I could figure no chance of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape. Nevertheless, I placed a barricade</seg><seg type="columnLine">of furniture against the wall. Then I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the telephone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wires of which--think of it!--Hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge had omitted to cut. I've often won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered, of dunderwittedness and crime,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is the cause and which the effect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardridge had been, as I was to learn next</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, among the higher-ups of crimedom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but even he neglected so obvious a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the cutting of a telephone wire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">mOF COURSE, I'd provided myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Osborne's home as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">office address, and. bv employing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ancient but usually effective catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">phrase, "Matter of life or death." I finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a sleepy somebody to promise to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. I admit that, aside from the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the hour was a suitable one for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">message I had for him, there was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfying in the idea of dragging the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort-loving lawyer from his bed at two in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello! Hello! Yes, this is Osborne.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hardly recognized the voice whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">suave tones had drawn me into this ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture. Irritable as it was, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly a touch of nervous dread in it, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That nervous dread, the jerky, frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes of my own voice were by no means</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to allay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Part-- No, no, I mean it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon. That's it, John Maxon. Are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you alone?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rogues' End</seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was interesting to notice how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alchemy of imagination and an evil con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">science transmuted my make-believe agi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation into real panic at the other end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire. Osborne's voice, when it came again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly shook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Practically, that is. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think-- Wait a minute." 1 think he</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed a door. "Now. But be careful over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 'phone. What lias happened?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing! That is-- Well, I'm leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, that's all. I can't go through with it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's aU. Good-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, wait a minute," Osborne cried in</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm. "Don't hang up. Wait a minute.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In Cragcastle, where you sent me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said nervously and half angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well-- Has any tiling-- What's hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing. I told you--nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But something has.

For your sake--pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection, as well as-- Listen! I'll ask ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. I warned you of danger, you re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, did it materialize?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah!" Osborne's voice dropped a key.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Is it--ended?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pronounced the last word so signifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cantly that there was no mistaking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning. It was the lawyer's safe way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking, over the wire, if Hardridge was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," I replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thought I heard, over the twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles that separated us, a quick, sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath of relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And--and I'm going," I continued.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It'll be--discovered. I had to-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," he interrupted me sharply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Take care. I quite understand. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to-- But I suppose you're quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">right--to go away. We'll have to give up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other project."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought he was almost too quick, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">realism, to put aside the hope we were both</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to have of dividing the Maxon</seg><seg type="columnLine">estate. But, of course, I was also sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to be quite unsuspicious that our</seg><seg type="columnLine">contract in regard to that estate was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">farce and that my function from the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning had been to kill or be killed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm glad you agree. Well, good-by!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wait a minute. Tell me. Was it only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one? Was he alone?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you any money?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was waiting for that question. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd ask it, because both he and his principal</seg><seg type="columnLine">would certainly desire that I travel far and</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedily, and I'd led him to believe I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">penniless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I laughed in a self-satisfied a fashion as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could manage and threw a touch of im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pudent boasting into my tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Plenty of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good," said Osborne somewhat per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexedly. "I'm glad of that. But I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to know-- Can't you tell me-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm off," I warned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where it is?" he finished desperately.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It'll have to be disposed of, you know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where'll I--whoever goes over--find it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was clear, of course, that he spoke of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardridge's body--another inquiry that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite inevitable he should make.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You might look," I said with a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">boastful gibe, "near the place old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon hid his sapphire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that? What do you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">about--" The lawyer's voice mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goo'd-by."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hung up the receiver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later the 'phone began ringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">furiously as if Osborne had managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">communicate to the inanimate instrument</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of his own agitation. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I cut the wire--as Hardridge should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I pulled a couch out of the parlor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed it near the door behind which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardridge was imprisoned, lay down on it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was soon asleep. Morning was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few hours off, and I was quite confident</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing would happen till then. Or, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, till the covering darkness of the follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing night. That is, if I divined correctly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nature of the man for whom I waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Which was, of course, not Osborne.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osborne was strictly an office worker. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be imagined playing any sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked game in the world--but through</seg><seg type="columnLine">intermediaries only. His own physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">participation and his own personal peril</seg><seg type="columnLine">would always be missing elements. No;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who would come to see to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety of the Maxon sapphire would be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who thought it his property--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who, using Osborne as agent, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted to bejfool me to his own place</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the Damoelean sword.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">LOOKING back, I've always felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day that followed was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most remarkable of my life--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I speak of the day, not of the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its element of tragedy. The day was</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable for its very lack of that element</seg><seg type="columnLine">--for its very unremarkableness. I hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, with such a night as had passed fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our memories, with Hardridge impris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oned, with the arrival of the man whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardridge had vowed to kill presumably</seg><seg type="columnLine">impending and with the girl's fortune and</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly more than one life depending upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the denouement, it was no commonplace</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that the day slipped by, to Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon and me, much like a pleasant holi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day outing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For I finally persuaded her to stay until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the working out of my plan. Concerning</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, by the way, I told her as little as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible. It's always much easier to agree</seg><seg type="columnLine">on an end than on the means, and it doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">always pay to tell everything even to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people in whose interest one may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">working.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We talked about a great many things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainly impersonal, and even took several</seg><seg type="columnLine">short walks. One of those walks took us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place that was then called Land's End.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was Miss Maxon who suggested it; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew nothing until then of the trap-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon at the rear of the house, with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide mouth and narrow exit upon the sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But we had no sooner arrived at the railing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that guarded that exiL, where we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">look down some hundred feel into white</seg><seg type="columnLine">surf, than Miss Maxon was seized with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">violent fit. of trembling and suggested that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we return. It was the only sign of real</seg><seg type="columnLine">agitation I saw in her that day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was late m the afternoon and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last time we left the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Breakfast and lunch had been largely</seg><seg type="columnLine">makeshifts, but dinner that evening was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a triumph, Osborne having supplied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house for my residence fairly well and Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon proving herself a miraculous cook.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After we'd eaten, I took his share of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal in to Hardridge, whom I found in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of eager expectancy. He evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered my promise that he'd be un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound at nightfall, and I didn't disappoint</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Instead of standing over him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn revolver while he ate, as I'd done</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, I simply released his hands and left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">him fumbling wildly but with stiff and</seg><seg type="columnLine">awkward fingers at his gag. I wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away from him More lie could ask me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in words the eager question Lhat had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring out of his overbright eves all day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, don't be a fool," I told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the closing door. "You can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out, and you don't want to get out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you don't want to make a noise. Be</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet, and you'll lie-glad of it later/'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I bolted the door without locking it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then pressed a button that projected</seg><seg type="columnLine">from tiie wall near the d&lt;x»r jamb. I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pleased exclamation from Hardridge as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the electric light came on within liis cell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thereafter he was silent, but, whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of my advice or because Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon and I remained so close to the closet</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could hear our occasional move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, I do not know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For by then it was quite dark, and. after</seg><seg type="columnLine">another little preparation for what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come, I joined Miss Maxon in the dining-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. The partition between this room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the reception-room split the inner wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the closet, and the house was so quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we could sometimes hear Hardridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe. We had turned on no lights save</seg><seg type="columnLine">that within the closet; so from without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place no doubt appeared absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything was silent and dark. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hours that wTe sat there, I found time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go over several times every incident</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected with my peculiar visit to Crag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">castle. My interest--desultory at first but</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly quickening--in the Chronicle want</seg><seg type="columnLine">ad.; my carefully worded letter in answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Osborne's skilfully alluring and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">noncommittal reply; our meeting--I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose I was one of some hundreds of appli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cants. most of whom were disposed of by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oflice boy; Osborne's quick inspection,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his clever cross-examination, his devious</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach to the subject of the missing heir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our agreement, and my arrival in mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">querade at Cragcastle. My interview with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardridge, not wholly unexpected, yet a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very curious one, filled with much that</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed explanation. My startling discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery of the presence of the girl, and her still</seg><seg type="columnLine">more startling revelations. The conception</seg><seg type="columnLine">and partial working out of my plan, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rogues' End</seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg><seg type="columnLine">success of which hung on the next few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout, I reflected, I had been for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunate; things had worked out very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I had planned and expected. My first</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive in the affair had been almost com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely satisfied; only one question re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained unanswered--that of the cause of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardridge's hatred of John Maxon. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained my awakened desire to serve</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Maxon, and in that I hoped that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fate--it is my egotistic conceit to some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times regard myself as Fate's co-con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirator--would help me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Miss Maxon, she would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">either more or less than the very natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman she was had she not felt fear in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those hours. Indeed, she had no tangible</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for placing confidence in me--</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather the reverse. It was largely because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that fact that I had urged her to stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Cragcastle. Sometimes I thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was partly because of that fact that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stayed. Perhaps she wanted to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">on hand at the finding of the sapphire--</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it were found. Well, my wish corre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponded. If it were not found, I wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to know it and be sure of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had, in fact, a remarkably strong desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand well in the estimation of Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon. And I was meditating upon this</seg><seg type="columnLine">and also upon the problems connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Ko Lao Hui when we both heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick, nervous steps coming up the gravel</seg><seg type="columnLine">path in front of the house. I whispered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly unnecessary' warning to Miss Maxon</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep quiet. Neither of us made a sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but both were on our feet when the key</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the newcomer grated in the lock of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN--after the front door had</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened and closed again--the hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights were switched on by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who seemed perfectly familiar with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their surroundings, I was standing just</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the dining-room door, with Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon perhaps a pace behind me. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man for whom we had waited started down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hall, I heard the slightest stirring in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the closet, which indicated that Hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge was also alert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The visitor, however, passed the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the closet without pausing and came on</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhesitatingly down the hall. The parlor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the reception-room he had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed; there remained but two possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">objectives, the library and the room wherein</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Maxon and I watched. That he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should turn into the latter had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance I had been compelled to take; if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did, the adventure would be apt to end</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedily and crudely. But great jewels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had reasoned, are not often concealed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dining-rooms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, as the girl and I held our breaths,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he passed our door, too, without a glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the obscurity beyond it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though he could hardly have seen us</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he looked our way, he was fully re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed by the hall light. The one look</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had of him was hardly reassuring for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">success of the game I had in mind. If we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever looked alike, then I owed it to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-respect to believe that Maxon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed greatly. But, indeed, I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had, for life stamps every face with</seg><seg type="columnLine">life's own mark, and Maxon's face had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become a danger signal of vice and coward-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice. Now I was -very glad I hadn't worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">my borrowed identity long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was now' only one door into which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon could turn, and he entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">library .across the hall without hesitation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like one sure of his objective. I felt a</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch on my arm and looked around into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Maxon's eyes, very close. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to flash me at once a warning and</seg><seg type="columnLine">question, and I shook my head reas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suringly. There wras no chance of Maxon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing out except by the front door. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man of his temperament nothing could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be less attractive than the gloom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">desolation of the black rocks that flanked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear exit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of Maxon's movements had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased. He had only been feeling for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch, for now', peering obliquely dowm</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hall, I saw the library lights flash on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed that he crossed the room; there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was another moment of silence and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of rending, scraping sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Which sound was, w'e afterward learned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spring-impelled opening of a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">door in the library wall and the tearing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall-paper that had been put on over it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind which door was a small vault, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I suppose only John Maxon, Sr.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the knowledge and the key until he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed it on to his son.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maxon had the sapphire--I knew so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much from his low exclamation of relief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardridge must have heard it, too, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred uneasily in his prison room. Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon's breathing quickened, while I--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, I held in ray hand almost literally</seg><seg type="columnLine">the key to the unexpected, and ray egotism</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pleasantly stirred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maxon came out of the library, now with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quickened movement and on tiptoe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He passed our door, bent over, fleeing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We heard something. Was it a bolt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been drawn? John Maxon stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">short.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A door was flung \iolentlv open. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door behind which Hardridge, up to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanty thirty seconds before, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">confined. And instantly I stepped out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hall behind Maxon. In fact, I stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and Hardridge burst out at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute. The effect was that we faced each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other in the well-lighted hall with Maxon</seg><seg type="columnLine">midway between us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardridge looked--well, to exaggerate</seg><seg type="columnLine">but slightly, like a devil's nightmare come</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive, crouching for the spring. For, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, he instantly thought of me, whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd got into the habit of trying to kill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he saw Maxon in the hall instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then me over Maxon s shoulder, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewilderment flashed into his face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">matched his rage. The doubt I'd tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to suggest to him, suddenly reinforced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked his rush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had intended, when I'd shaped mat ters</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far, to put that doubt fairly in the form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a question, but John Maxon himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it unnecessary, had answered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">question before it was asked in a gesture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of self-betrayal He staggered back--</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw up his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hardridge!" he croaked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something in his right hand left a streak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light behind it, like a shooting star.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aijd Hardridge, arriving at the truth too</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly for memory or logic, recognizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his enemy by a species of instinct, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have leaped in dreadful silence at Maxon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. But I jerked my revolver up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered them both.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One minute," I said. "Well, Maxon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes. I'm the man. Fra the man your tool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osborne, picked to take your place here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keep back, Hardridge. No, there'll be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing here--not till 1 find out what it's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Speak up, Hardridge," I ordered, turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from Maxon's twitching features to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hard ridge's inflamed and deadly face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What have you against this man?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That, ---- him!" exploded Hardridge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That traitor and thief! He stole the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money that would have saved me from</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison--me aud the rest of us. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">coward and cur! Why, blast you," this</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly to Maxon, "you knew that without</seg><seg type="columnLine">that money we were lost. The--re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formers-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has a license to talk, he has,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">quavered Maxon, standing sidewise in die</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall, alternately glancing apprehensively</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Hardridge and beseechingly at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unhappy, indeed, was his situation, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">only hope of life being in me, whom he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned to dupe to the same death that now</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who was he?" I asked Maxon. "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the point, quick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He! He was a dirtv gambling-house</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper and dive-keeper and worse. King</seg><seg type="columnLine">of crookdom through his pull in the City</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hall. And the money he savs I stole was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slush fund to keep the politician crooks</seg><seg type="columnLine">in office. Because the other side won and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went to San Quentin where he belonged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he blamed me-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You whining sneak," cried Hardridge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you were thick enough with us while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">going was good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That'll do, the pair of you," I said. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite understand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did, well enough. Details were missing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they were unessential. These two</seg><seg type="columnLine">were part of the ring that had in the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">days debauched the city government of</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Francisco. To me that crime con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitutes one of the baser forms of treason,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I admit my linger twitched to shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">them both.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I thought of the sapphire. I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed no definite plan as to acquiring it</seg><seg type="columnLine">once John Mason had taken it out of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding-place. Circumstances must guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and--here were the circumstances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I SUPPOSE in a way I was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsible for what followed. I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose that my apparent indecision</seg><seg type="columnLine">encouraged Hardridge, and I may even</seg><seg type="columnLine">have stepped a little to one side. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know I didn't plan the thing or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">foresee it. I did have a peculiar flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision of that dark canon at the rear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house, that dark canon with its smooth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep, narrowing sides and its floor dipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever more rapidly toward the jumping-off</seg><seg type="columnLine">place at the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anyway, all of a sudden Hardridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rogues' End</seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg><seg type="columnLine">started for Maxon. Maxon did the natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for him; he whirled and ran. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly have stopped him if I had tried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He brushed me back against Miss Maxon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and half-way through the dining-room</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, and Hardridge tore after him without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a chair near the end of the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Maxon had sanity enough left to push</seg><seg type="columnLine">it before him through the window. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed the chair head first, and Hardridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged through the opening after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was delayed a little in unlocking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. I stepped out into a fantastic hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ragged rocks, flooded here at the ravine's</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning with moonlight. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow' pass to the right, but Maxon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed that pass. And he and Hardridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">were leaping like shadows straight down</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Land's End.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maxon seemed to be straining to stop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps he saw the railing and memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him of what was beyond it. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pace was so great and the grade was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so steep that he could not check himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">all at once, and he brought up against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railing with such force that it creaked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagged outward under the impact. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">still held.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Hardridge clutched him. But, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time I got close enough to see clearly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon had seized Hardridge's wrists and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was prying them outward and slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosing Hardridge's grip on his throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wrenched Hardridge's hands away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Hardridge gripped him around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Maxon gripped him likewise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to bend Hardridge's body backward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, they'll be killed. Can't you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Maxon had come up, frightened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing. She would have run up to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus put herself in danger, but I held</seg><seg type="columnLine">her back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear Miss Maxon! My 'dear Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing else I could say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned and saw how very like an open</seg><seg type="columnLine">door was the end of the canon. Beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">that door the sky sparkled with stars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the waters beneath the stars reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">their light. But the water at the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cliff must have been too unquiet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflect it. I could hear it roaring as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">surged over the rocks, and I imagined it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretching up white and hungry fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't you stop them!" cried Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One more look I took at the place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two men had struggled. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped between Miss Maxon and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">placfe and urged her gently back toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">CragcasUe. For Hardridge, knowing him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self overmastered, had suddenly yielded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and somehow dragged Maxon with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the railing. Maxon gripped the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rock, but Hardridge tore his grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">relentlessly away. And so there came an</seg><seg type="columnLine">end to the bad beginning made many years</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I reflected, as I picked a w-ay up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneven canon bottom, that the quivering</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman whom I led would probably some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day be mistress of Cragcastle, since her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father was now heir to the Maxon fortune.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In that case they could well afford the loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sapphire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WE PARTED at the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain, Miss Maxon and I. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not late, and we could go</seg><seg type="columnLine">different ways quite unnoticed into Mill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valley and thence to San Francisco. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing that had happened at Cragcastle</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ever discovered, there was no possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility that she'd be connected with it, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">in thought. While as for me. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry you're going back to China,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said. N</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course she would be, for I'd told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely nothing of my errand there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unraveling the mystery of the Ko Lao Hui</seg><seg type="columnLine">leadership. If she had known w-hat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of me, she would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad my eagerness to be at it was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have been--well, fine," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I murmured a few deprecating phrases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And--wonderful. I've been trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess--how much of it all you had planned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out ahead. The escape of Hardridge, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">instance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" I questioned noncommittedlv.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You pretended it was accidental.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he had done very' well to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">command at twenty-seven, but the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as blind to his merits as Silas was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his need of more salary. And yet she kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">him hanging on, pretending to love him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not that the captain realized the pretense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Being his ideal, liis divinity, she was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond such a thing. And he loved her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted her. Had the opportunity offered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt that he would turn pirate to win her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he cursed himself for not being his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own boss, for being dependent upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money of Silas Rutherford and his kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, taking it altogether, he was an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant commander, and, when he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his room shortly after eight bells, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third mate, who had come on duty, breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">more relievedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the Psyche was pounding her way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to port, her owner was reading a document</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had to do with her insurance. As a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of fact, old Silas Rutherford could</seg><seg type="columnLine">recite the wording of that policy, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">assisted his complex and criminal cogita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions to read and reread it while he planned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The old phrase, handed down from genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to generation of marine underwriters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to him visions of delightful possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bilities. "Now, touching upon the perils</seg><seg type="columnLine">--such as--" They wrere all there, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The act of God and the king's enemies"</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all the chances of sea-disaster, and Silas</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved to dwell on them, hoping his ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">would fall foul of one or all of them, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he greatly disliked paving premiums.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was before the Great Killing put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breath of life into old hulks, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">freights were so low that dead ships paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than live ones; when, because of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter fact, insurance policies were some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times converted into cash by the unmoral.</seg><seg type="columnLine">xAnd Silas owned eight vessels that just</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraped into the A 1 classification by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin of their paint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not that he could be accused of lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort in regard to striving for profit, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">when freights denied it--and Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams and the other captains and</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers in the ships of Silas were not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only people aware of his scraping. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">name was a byword, and his stinginess</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to refer to as the acme of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">meanness. But Silas cared nothing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indeed, he probably enjoyed his reputa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and went on serving out paint with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the care of a chemist serving attar of roses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while seeing to it that his crews, tired of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting for life against the board of trade</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowance--weighed out to them by partisan</seg><seg type="columnLine">scales and dredged from the dusty corners</seg><seg type="columnLine">of condemned ship-chandlers' stores, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted at the first port--with wages, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, unpaid. And Captain Williams and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other captains and officers, as already</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned, slaved on low salaries for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonus which always mysteriously eluded</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even such careful business methods</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to produce a dividend. Which</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused Silas to take his insurance policies</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the safe to yearn over them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the one he fondled most was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">policy that covered the ancient Psyche.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had paid many premiums on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">promising piece of paper, all of them clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain to the insurance company, and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly the amount of that premium had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Psyche been a dead loss to him for more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a year. Surely the coincidence was</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant as a hint. A deacon of his church</seg><seg type="columnLine">for more than forty years. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat in his lonely, dingy office, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm breeze of the Summer evening bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the window the noise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattling winches on ships loading and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charging in the near-by docks. He usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat there until bedtime, because he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends and because to spend money on</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement was an impossible vice to a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who would rather have the money than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amusement. And he wasn't worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a million pounds, exclusive of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his exasperating investment in ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So for many evenings had he deliberated</seg><seg type="columnLine">over an untimely end for the Psyche.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither did the idea leave him altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the day. But the one large obstacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the scheme was the need of an accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plice. He would have to find a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to undertake the sinking or burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ship, and that man would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be well-paid. Of course, the captain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best man for the job. But, then, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain would not only have more at stake</seg><seg type="columnLine">than an ordinary man, but he would also</seg><seg type="columnLine">be more expensive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would be risking his certificate in</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">addition to taking the chance of going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prison, and he would know the value</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the insurance policy. Yet Silas clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the notion of getting the captain to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. If he could only "get around" Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams in some way. There must be a way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for every man has his weak side, or else</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is something he wants so badly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he will do anything to get it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SO HE reasoned. Yet, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakness of Captain Williams came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the office next morning, Silas</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly missed his opportunity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She came early, her good looks and pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended embarrassment signaling for help--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which three clerks immediately attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give her. But Silas prevented them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is, he happened to come into the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that moment, and the clerks scurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to their desks as he brushed past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl on the way to his roofti--leaving her</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing in the middle of Lhe floor, appealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the universe with a studied pose. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerks peered over their desks at her, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markably like three scared mice peering</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of their holes at a tempting piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheese which the proximity of the cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevented them from appropriating, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a shrug she turned and walked boldly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the private office, astonishing Silas</seg><seg type="columnLine">by asking sweedy when the Psyche would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in port.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did you get in here?" he barked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl pouted and indicated the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what do you want?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When will the Psyche come in?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you want to know for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because--because Captain Williams is--</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a friend of mine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A remarkable change came over Silas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He became almost polite, closing the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dragging a chair to the desk for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down, won't you? So you're a friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the captain's, ch. Very lucky man!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he giggled in the senile way of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaccustomed to women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes--we--we--you see-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She blushed with the acquired art of long</seg><seg type="columnLine">practise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do see--you are going to marrv him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps," she stiffened slightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Ump "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silas was thinking hard, but the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">believing him at the limit of his conver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sational powers, decided, for reasons of.</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own, to help him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It s the way I've been brought up,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she hinted. She had been "brought up"</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the unpleasant environment of a cheap</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon--a "tied house," owned by a brew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery--of which her father had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ostensible proprietor. "I've had so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">good offers that the wages of a ship-captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">look kind of small. But, oh my, what am</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saying--you must think i'm oreful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking to a stranger this way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> •'Not at all. my dear." Silas found him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self thinking he needed a new' suit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," she further elucidated, "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">making him waiL till he gets better off."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greater luck can no man have than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman will hare her fool soul to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the somewhat fascinated Silas missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the revelation, seeing only a pretty girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose power over the captain of the Psyche</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be used advantageously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You w'on't tell him I was here." she</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattled on. "He's so jealous, you know."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She wondered wiiat it would be like to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">married to a man w'orth a million pounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if he w*ere old.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I won't tell him you were here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silas held her unresisting hand. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never known a woman like her, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps unfortunate, because there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no memory' she could revive to bring back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the taste of rotten fruit--which most men</seg><seg type="columnLine">have lipped and remember only with</seg><seg type="columnLine">feelings of the deepest shame. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry when she left, and she had shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that Williams could be handled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later on he recollected that he had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered her question about the docking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Psyche. She was too good for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams, anyhow!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the captain w*as an honest man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Silas was nervous about broaching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject. He waited until the Psyche had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in port two days. Then, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of business details, he suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hear you're going to get married?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain flushed but said nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Girl want to wait till there's more money</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bank?" suggested Silas crudely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something like that." admitted Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams gruffly, his face showing how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'oman had fascinated him, how he craved</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--" Silas seemed to sneer--"if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">Touching the Perils</seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted a girl and was a big, strong, young</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow like you, I'd do more than sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">around--I'd rob a bank before I'd let her</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away from me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That would only get me in jail," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted Williams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silas laughed to hide his nervousness--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Would you do it if you knew you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't get caught?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'd do anything," growled the captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But what's the good of talking about it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," Silas hesitated, then took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge, "well, I can show you a way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams was first astonished; then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was effusively grateful--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you do that, Mr. Rutherford, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">give my life for you any time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't want you to do that." Silas</seg><seg type="columnLine">got up, walked to the door,' opened it sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, saw that no one was listening and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to his desk. "Don't want you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do that," he cackled at the surprized</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped talking--it was a difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">job, this, even harder than he had expected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wondered how Williams would face the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Board of Trade investigation after the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was done. Lawyers have a way of making</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors tell more than they want. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen 'em.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The fact is," he managed after a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, "the fact is, Captain, the Psyche</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been a dead loss to me for some time."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've done my best, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes, I know you have. But all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same, you know, I can not be expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep on taking losses. I'm not in busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness for the fun of it any more than you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are. But, while you get your pay every</seg><seg type="columnLine">voyage, whether the ship makes a profit</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not, I don't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You aren't thinking of laying her up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you, sir?'' The captain was naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">distressed at such a possibility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May have to," Silas sighed, "unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can help me out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me, sir? What would you suggest, sir?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I	can not see where I can cut down expenses</seg><seg type="columnLine">anywhere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silas appeared to think deeply. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went to the safe and brought back the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insurance policy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose that, like every other captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">afloat, you've often thought about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insurance, haven't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and with the way things are I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">often felt like I'd like to make a profit for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that way, sir," was the astounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you mean it?" Silas almost shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, no, of course not. I was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">joking," replied the somewhat shame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced Williams. "You know, just as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, nearly every skipper thinks about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insurance now and then--and wonders."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," Silas spoke very' quietly now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am not joking--not a bit of it. Things</seg><seg type="columnLine">have come to the place where I don't joke</seg><seg type="columnLine">about insurance. See here, help me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize on this, and I'll give you command</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my best ship with increase of pay and</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred pounds as well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had said it. He had taken the leap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now he watched the captain--who for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment was speechless--with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprehension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?" growled the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain. "Want me to turn crook?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know what you just said?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, but that was in fun."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"IS IT fun about your wanting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get married, too?" Silas grinned--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain had given him far less</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble than he had expected. "If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't sink the Psyche for me, I'll get a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who will, fire you and give you no reference.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where would your marriage be then?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where would it? The unhappy sailor</seg><seg type="columnLine">could easily answer that question. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was hardly a chance of being found</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Wasn't she worth taking that chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose I tell the insurance com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany what you asked me to do?" he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll have you arrested for criminal libel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and send you to prison. You have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">witness, you know. But why be foolish?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only you and me will know--and its my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, anyway. I'll be hanged if I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand why you even hesitate--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fine young lady like that waiting for you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. And the money all's between you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams said nothing. Every cell in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great body craved the girl, and. when in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a condition, a man's morals are</seg><seg type="columnLine">smothered by very primitive emotions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, as he had said, most sailors look upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">insurance from the owners' standpoint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just think," urged Silas, "you're char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered to a Spanish port. Easy cargo to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire.

You know just where to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. And afterward you'll get my best</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, you know. And, yes, I'll let you take</seg><seg type="columnLine">your wife to sea with you. Chances are</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, if you don't take this offer and get</seg><seg type="columnLine">some money, she'll marry some other man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And you know it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williaras did know it. And he remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered vividly an unpleasant scene of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous evening when the lady had taunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him about his lack of ability t6 make</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. She wanted a diamond ring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which his scant savings made impossible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And here was five hundred pounds going</seg><seg type="columnLine">begging. The job was easy enough. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in six weeks, at the most, he could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">married, get a better ship with more pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">and take her to sea with him. That last</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled hardest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''What are the terms?" he asked gruffly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not looking at Silas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fifty pounds dowm and the balance</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the job's done. Your pay increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">two pounds a month from today. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, no lay-off when the Psyche sinks."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still the captain hesitated. He loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships and felt not unlike a prospective</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderer. Indeed, this sentiment weighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">more on the moral side than did the chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being found out. But, then, Silas, old</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoundrel, would get another man to do it</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless he did it. And the girl. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams got out of the chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll let you know tomorrow," he prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised and went to see the lady.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He saw her. What chance had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">scruples in her presence, that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak enough in the office of Silas Ruther-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford. For sailors are really myopic about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rights of insurance companies. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their last parting still in his mind, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted her with--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How would you like a fifty-pound</seg><seg type="columnLine">diamond ring?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You darling. How did you do it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't say I'd got it. I just asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">you how you'd like one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She moved away from him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know I want one. Do you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">it clever to talk that way. It's bad enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think of marrying a man too poor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">buy a girl what every other engaged girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">has, without him making a joke about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'd be ashamed if you had any." And</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cloudburst settled the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little later, after he had promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to buy the ring next day, she again asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he raised the money. He told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his raise of pay, the best ship, permission</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take his wife--did she know who that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady was--and invented a savings-account</seg><seg type="columnLine">of long duration to account for the ring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, if a man must sell his soul, why not</seg><seg type="columnLine">for kisses? For has any philosopher yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">proven them to be w'orth less than pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of silver?</seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     SO A few wreeks later Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams wralked down the&gt; rocky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog-smelly street of a tiny Spanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">fishing village, the stars looking at him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a windy sky and his mouth gritty with</seg><seg type="columnLine">curses. It was after midnight, and, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">for spasmodic barkings and the moan of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flood tide, the place was quiet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep-suggesting. But Williams could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. Indeed, he doubted if he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever sleep again, for his thoughts were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring cyclone that would not still. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had left his bed in the smugglers' retreat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an inn and gone dowm to the shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And everything had looked so bright.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Things had gone just as he had planned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Psyche had caught fire in six places</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shortly afterward slipped to the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea without making much fuss.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ten hours in the boats--Williams had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">favored with a nice fair wind--and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands had been safely landed. Then, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news cabled to Silas, the captain had waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">for orders and congratulations wrhile he</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged for the crew to be sent home</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the distressed seaman's route.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By rights he should have gone with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his conscience had gathered to itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">all manner of intangible fears, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to wrait in the village. Then Silas</seg><seg type="columnLine">had replied to the cable--by letter, to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. And with the letter from Silas</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man had been abusive. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the captain been so careless as to lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">a valuable ship and cargo? This w'as to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Touching the Perils</seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected, and Williams had grinned at</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he imagined to be cunning and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while grinning, did not trouble to finish</seg><seg type="columnLine">the letter. Instead, he opened the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he was itching to read.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the other letter had opened his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken his heart, as he believed, and shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that Silas had meant what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">written. For Silas had married the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who wrote saying she could never marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who lost his ship, who would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">get another ship, and who hadn't a penny</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his name. But she forgot to send the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring. That was all, except that she loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Rutherford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no word from Silas about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hundred and fifty pounds he had prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised to pay and nothing about the command</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his best steamer. No; just the curt</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter of abuse and the reminder that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams would get no reference from him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the illuminating scrawl from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. No wonder Wrilliams could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. But he would get even. Oh, yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would show them. But how? To</seg><seg type="columnLine">write to the insurance company would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silas would have him arrested for libel--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the libel of a disappointed suitor--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">company would arrest him for barratry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And what chance would his word have</seg><seg type="columnLine">against that of Silas? Silas, with a million</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds to hire lawyers, and W7illiams</seg><seg type="columnLine">without--the girl had spoken at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">one true w-ord--a penny. He even owed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the keepeF of the cheap inn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Williams saw nothing strange about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wedding. The woman's cleverness</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped him. He was so infatuated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her that it never occurred to him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silas was an old fool who had fallen as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he himself had fallen. For Williams still</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed that any man would marry her</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she were willing, and he thought Silas</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky. To have thought otherwise would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done away with the urge for revenge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was all that mattered now--to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">even.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when a few nights later the dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper of the inn shut the door in his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">about bedtime, shrieking shrill abuse which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to do with the payment of debt, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams had no place to go but the beach--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desire tor revenge had grown colder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Immediate need had fogged its clarity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kisses were of less wrorth than square</seg><seg type="columnLine">meals and warm beds. But there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither beds, meals nor kisses in sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet, its shadow beckoning across the calm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlit sea, was a small fishing-boat at</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchor and untenanted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, shivering slightly, the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped, bundled his clothes on his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, swimming high, made his way to her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Climbing on board, he dressed, wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in the sail and after a time slept.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No doubt the graybeards of that village</seg><seg type="columnLine">will tell for many years the legend about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thief of an Englishman who, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">content with robbing the keeper of the inn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole also a fishing-boat. But, like most</seg><seg type="columnLine">legends, the tale will lack truth. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams did not steal the boat. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrary, the boat stole the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That is, while he slept, it tugged uneasily</seg><seg type="columnLine">at its anchor until the grass rope doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty as a cable parted, and Williams, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping, was carried out to sea on the ebb</seg><seg type="columnLine">tide. He awoke with the call to breakfast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the call was but the echo of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">meals, for there wasn't a crust on board.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the land was a mere haze, and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships were in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tale of thirst and hunger has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">too often told to be here repeated. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, there is nothing pleasing about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tale. More pleasing to Williams is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that three days later he reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gibraltar in the dark, was mistaken for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a denizen of the place and met a shrewd</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rock scorpion who had no ears for tales</seg><seg type="columnLine">but who gave him five pounds for the boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, of course, was worth much more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But five pounds to the captain was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of fortune. Once more he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat, sleep and smoke. And revenge still</seg><seg type="columnLine">called him, but its voice was not so near.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was obviously his duty, both to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and the underwriters, to go back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">England for the Board of Trade investiga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Silas had been right when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the captain's certificate would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackened, but a guilty conscience saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">less clearly. As it was, he might find an</seg><seg type="columnLine">out-of-the-way owner who would not ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions--for the ticket and his previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharges were in his possession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But Gib. was no place to find such owners,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although it w'as an excellent place to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of them. The five pounds melted</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly, and W illiams had no desire to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">another door shut in his face about bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time when friendly fish-boats might not</seg><seg type="columnLine">beckon so kindly. And, once broke, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be harried into some ship's fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">castle without chance of holding back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So one sunlit morning he went in search</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Rock scorpion and found him easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Howdy?" the scorpion was affable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams replied in kind and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">collect the memories having to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorpions. He had heard about their</seg><seg type="columnLine">many underground methods of doing busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and their supposed vast wealth. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumors that they formed a sort of trust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had a finger in all Gibraltar business,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had also come his way. He knew that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while willing to buy a fishing-boat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in league with the many smugglers in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">district, it was no uncommon event to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scorpion bid for a steamer at auction</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pay fifty or sixty thousand pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">cash when it was knocked down to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But whether the scorpions worked as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">league or as individuals was no concern</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Williams', because this shabby, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what unclean, English-language-mangling</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixture of a hundred different breeds was</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously not only his star of hope but</seg><seg type="columnLine">also his last resort--excepting, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some ship's forecastle, under a new name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like to talk business with you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams succeeded in making his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound comfortably indifferent, although back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in liis mind the final episode of the kid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naping fish-boat loomed largely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, ha, of course--we go to my horfice."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY walked along the warm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusty, winding road until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at a sort of wine-shop, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the customary sign relating to the purity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and antiquity of the goods sold within</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the usual heavy population of flies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Near the door a young Spaniard made</seg><seg type="columnLine">querulous demand of a starved donkey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphasizing his wishes with a stick. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the animal continued to study the sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wine-shop as if he sought patiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some degree of truth, and blow's could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not penetrate to his absorbed mind. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed inside, where the apparent owner</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept comfortably, quite indifferent to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">likeness to a fly-paper--waking into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">million smiles when the scorpion kicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This my home and horfice," the scorpion</seg><seg type="columnLine">made some unnecessary remark. "Into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back room this son of ten thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">thieves will bring us drink, where we may</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk in peace, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gentleman of the penitentiary family</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased the ratio of his smiling at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reference to his ancestors, produced two</seg><seg type="columnLine">not overly clean glasses and a bottle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">led the way into the back room--a dingy</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, which, however, was gratefully cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the business you have?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The preliminaries were over, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorpion made inquiry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Williams hesitated. In the hard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious eyes of the scorpion he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer to any request for a job, the answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to any asking for assistance--a sneering</seg><seg type="columnLine">"nothing for you"--and a sickening feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of failure was succeeded by a gust, of anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">at himself for ha\ing stooped so low. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then suddenly he felt himself in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual position of being, as it were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind those eyes--of looking at himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the eyes of another man. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he saw' made him ashamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he realized that all men who have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the courage to sail their own ships--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men w'ho do not depend on "jobs"--must</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard him as the scorpion would do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he mentioned the "business"--</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a sort of weakling, as a failure, as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sort that wants things arranged for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, much as a mule needs harnessing</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it can work. Yes, he saw himseS</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one lacking that something which causes</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man to struggle towrard an ideal, heedless</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mire he must go through--to inde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he asked himself why? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should he not be his own boss when this</seg><seg type="columnLine">wretched Rock scorpion could be? Surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had as much intelligence. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not even a white man--was a mongrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a hundred mixtures. Yet he had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of himself. Better a burglar</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a beggar. Williams saw himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost cringing to this mongrel for a job,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing the rotten bidding of old Silas, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave to his lust for a woman--even this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his moment of clarity, did he see. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">--for such things do actually happen--</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that moment Williams became something.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as a chemical solution remains a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere grouping of molecules until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">addition of the needed constituent causes</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipitation, so had Williams lived in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inchoate condition of the majority of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind--until this moment in the grimy</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine-shop. What really happened he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew or troubled to know. He felt his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Touching the Perils</seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and chin stiffen to the latent power</seg><seg type="columnLine">in him that had found its motive, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, now grimly smiling, fought down</seg><seg type="columnLine">very easily those of the scorpion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, there was no business that he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of, but in his new condition such an ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittance was unthinkable. Therefore he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fenced. And luck was with his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage with the swords of business, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lirst job as his own boss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How many ships do you want?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked carelessly, rapidly deciding that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the scorpion had bought ships once, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might buy them again and, if nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">came of his question, he had saved his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the pretense of having something for</seg><seg type="columnLine">sale. To his astonishment the scorpion</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed startled, most upset. So many</seg><seg type="columnLine">words rushed for outlet that they jammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his throat like a panic-stricken crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to escape from a burning building.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And this agitation grew rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who told you? What you mean, eh?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Have you just pretend? You come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish-boat; look like you broke. Not fair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. Oh, ha, no, not at all fair. I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you all the time were fooling. Yes, I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wife that. You ask her. She say so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. Now, what the game, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams laughed and continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh to give himself time to think. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should the scorpion be so excited? Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposing that he had some deal on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to do with the buying of ships--why</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth should the mere mention of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw him into such a state of mingled</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear and anger? Things were so bad all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the world that only an unprecedented</seg><seg type="columnLine">buying could send prices up--nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the scorpion could be connected with.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet, what was he afraid of?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," Williams spoke quietly, delight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the new feeling of power, "I had my</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons for coming to Gib. in that old boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for selling her to you at far below</seg><seg type="columnLine">her proper price. Mavbe I hadn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite so far out to sea as I looked." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused, wondering what the owner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat had thought, meaning to pay him</seg><seg type="columnLine">some day. "But you don't expect me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you all that, do you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scorpion rapped loudly on the table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed the lazy innkeeper when he appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave great orders about setting up-the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very best wine in the house in a hurry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had a notion that hospitality greases</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are friends, no?" he professed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you like to put it that way--I'm not</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular," Wrilliams crushed down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakening memory of what he had 'been</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wine arrived*, and Williams was</seg><seg type="columnLine">amused at the ceremonious manner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorpion. It reminded him of something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whom had he seen drink that way?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the wine did not loosen the tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the scorpion, although Williams ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned him quite cleverly. Consequently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain was driven to invention. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a fair knowledge of financial methods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if most of it had been acquired in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucket-shops that had prevented his savings</seg><seg type="columnLine">from rising to diamond rings. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood something of the wrays of ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brokers. That reference to ships seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be trumps. At any rate, it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only card in his hand. He decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">play it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, look here, Sylvester," he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lie fluently, "what I have been doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">is all my business. I took that boat just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I always take what I happen to want,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but what caused me to take her is also</seg><seg type="columnLine">my business. Now, the two men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have had watching you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sylvester jumped out of his chair, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes popping. For why had the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">had him watched? Had they not always</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the best of friends. If the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted more for the fish-boat, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to say so, and the money would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">given him at once. He knew they wrere</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends. They had drunk much" wine</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. He had always loved the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had heard of the great deeds of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful man, the captain's father, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. For why had he been w*atched as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wrere a thief?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an effort Williams put an end</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this unexpected but very satisfactory</seg><seg type="columnLine">outburst. It was obvious that Sylvester</seg><seg type="columnLine">was interested in ships, queer though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed. And he knew the methods of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorpions pretty well. If this one were</seg><seg type="columnLine">buying ships--and he appeared to be--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would buy them on options. For,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether he w'ere buying for himself or for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some Asiatic who w-anted to become an</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner--which often happened--or buying</seg><seg type="columnLine">on speculation--whatever reason, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">first buy an option on the vessel or vessels</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wanted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This deduction was so simple that to</seg><seg type="columnLine">78</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring it on Sylvester would surprize him</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more than it would suqjrize a stock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler to tell him you knew he was buying</seg><seg type="columnLine">on margin. But, if Williams could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scorpion to believe he knew why he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was buying or whom he was buying for--</seg><seg type="columnLine">why, in that case, he might do business.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Because people who wanted to buy ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">in anything but a very small way were at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time rare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, I wanted to know about you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I paid to lind out," he growled. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you think 1 made my money--by selling</seg><seg type="columnLine">boats? So I made up my mind to see you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because there wras money in it. Because,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, 1 found out you are trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tie up a bunch of steamers on options."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I*! AGAIN Sylvester rapidly worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">feiita his hands and tongue, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">denial was weak. What would he</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw away money like that for--ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">not worth anything? Did the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">think him a fool to buy options when ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not paying the owners enough to buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">paint? He went on hastily to explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he knew this because he sold paint,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he went off at a tangent, gabbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the paint business until Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut him up again, grinning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He filled one of the glasses to the brim</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drank to the staring scorpion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now--" he put down the empty glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know you're after options, but you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">not getting them as fast as you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">because you have to go awful quiet about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I, too, have bought options. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it doesn't matter who will take them up--</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know, and I know. The difference is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you are buying the options directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the final buyers of the steamers, w'hile</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am buying on spec, with my own money.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I didn't know that your people will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to take my options off my hands at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">profit to me, you don't think I'd have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool enough to buy them, with times as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are, do you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fascinated Sylvester shook his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">in agreement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So 1 know who you're working for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I know they want a lot of ships. 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">have between twenty and thirty Ai</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamers tied up that I will turn over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your people, and I have another fleet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven right under my hand." He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of Silas and his unfortunate in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestment in shipping. "Now, don't ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">me questions, because you won't get any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing out of me. Tell the chap who is</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind you that he can come to my hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow morning if he wants to do busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness at the right price. That's all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shot a glance at the scorpion and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his surmise had been correct. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was some man behind Sylvester, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was in Gibraltar. So far, so good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he had learned that often the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewd men are the most credulous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially when their suspicions can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When can you deliver?" Sylvester,</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitting everything, spoke like one deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">grieved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whenever I want to. Charters and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship can be transferred together, if neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary, but most of them are only chartered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from voyage to voyage. Not a one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them is tied up for more than a month.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, of course, I have to give, in most cases,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain number of days' notice." For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment Williams was afraid his limited</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge had caused liim to make a slip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the scorpion appeared quite satisfied;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he went on. "But don't imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I tied up forty or fifty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds for the fun of it. Use your brain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sylvester. Why did I come to you in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty fish-boat?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That w'as a clever move, for the scorpion's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind loved the curved route, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">action of his backer depended greatly upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sylvester's opinion of Williams. The cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain did not know it, but the scorpion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing profits for himself without much</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor, had already decided to tell his man</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had known Williams for thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, knew him to be worth at least a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and fifty thousand pounds--</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are many men of millions not known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Bradstreet--knew his word to be as</seg><seg type="columnLine">good as a bond and knew all about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">good old English family before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, when the way looked very smooth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams was to realize this character-</seg><seg type="columnLine">painting of the scorpion, and now his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky words helped the selection of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightest colors. For Sylvester's mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved the crooked lane, the while he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved it to be straight. The dim, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, the mysterious appealed to him w'hen</seg><seg type="columnLine">square buying and spiling wouldn't rouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to interest. Yes, and he believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">every word Williams had told him, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he would have called a straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">Touching the Perils</seg><seg type="columnLine">79</seg><seg type="columnLine">tale a lie. He thought over all he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night he had slipped into Gib.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodging the customs and all, liis worn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out state hinting at anything; his laughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had asked the scorpion if he cared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to buy "so small a ship"--Sylvester had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not remarked the significance of the phrase</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the time, but now it gripped him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pinch of a million suggestions--his tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the money without counting it; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lazing around ever since until his mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious coming that morning. And this</seg><seg type="columnLine">wras what it meant. It would be w-ell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep on the right side of this man. A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of parts--and clever. How had he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">out who wanted those options?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sylvester did not know this himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He only knew Smith, the agent for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">capitalists. But he would never let Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams know that he knew so little. Later</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, when the captain had made much</seg><seg type="columnLine">money because of what Sylvester told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith--then, good friends, he would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain very drunk--oh, he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way--and he would find out. But just</seg><seg type="columnLine">now was no time to take any chances with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a promising friendship. Not that it mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered who was putting up the money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And we are good friends, no?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated as Williams swung his bulk out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a bit particular--would do business</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a jackal. Tell your man tomorrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, if he wants to see me. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy. Expect to go to London in a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two--back right away. Keep your eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">open for anything good not in the shipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, and let me know. May help you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a shilling or two."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He threw one of his few remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">shillings at the dirty innkeeper, conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Sylvester would force him to divide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left the place to which he had come as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppliant--as a man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg><seg type="columnLine">WILLIAMS awoke early from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream in which old Silas Rutherford</seg><seg type="columnLine">had begged for a penny, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silas, needing bread, had been the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a long line of small Rutherfords. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">got out of bed feeling like an expectant</seg><seg type="columnLine">child on Christmas morning. And wrhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the stocking hold for him? He shaved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembering the previous day and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days before that with an angry shame.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he would never be a crawler again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thrilled to the joy of rebirth. What a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile of lies he had told Sylvester. Who the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil wras behind the scorpion, anyhow?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet he was proud of those lies. How much</seg><seg type="columnLine">would he make out of this chance if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">handled it right? Might get enough out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it to make up for the four hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he made a large breakfast, lit a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar and went out to the veranda. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man behind the scorpion would come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, all right. And he did come, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">further stimulated the intuitive faith Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams had in himself. He was half-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the cigar when a boy brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a card bearing the name "J. P. Smith,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no address or prefix.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Smith himself was just as indefinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">in appearance. An Englishman, appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently, with no trace of an accent to indicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">his county. He was dressed neatly but</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply, clean-shaven and about the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">age as Williams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Know ships well, eh?" he remarked as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they sat down in a quiet corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," Williams studied him; "went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea for a w'hile, until I came into my money.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never wrent to sea, but I served some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in an engineering shop. Got this scar</seg><seg type="columnLine">there--a furnace-tender hit me with a hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">slice-bar."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned his head so that Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see a scar across liis left cheek, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">three inches in length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I savvy," Williams grinned. "Had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few scraps myself, but they mostly left me</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone on account of my size."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This exhausted their introductory sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance. For a few minutes neither spoke;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Smith said thoughtfully:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sylvester gave me a great account of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, and, as he dare not fool me, I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and am willing to do business with you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He says you have already bought some</seg><seg type="columnLine">options on ships, which seems to prove what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he also says--that you know who the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people are behind this thing. Do you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams looked at the other, their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">met and held. The captain spoke quietly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">''I have the options, winch, as you say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to prove that I do know. But don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think it better--for me--to act as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not know who is really going to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ships? I know I'd like it better if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">8o</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought I was only selling to Mr. Smith.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If we have to speak of--of those others--</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose we call them 'the firm?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith laughed softly and dropped his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," he murmured, "that's it. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't blame you, and I feel safe you won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk. Now suppose I put my cards on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. We have only just begun to buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">options, and I was given the job of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">them because I am not a shipping man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would not be suspected. I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to Gibraltar on another matter, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having heard about these scorpions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ability to get ships cheap, I tied up</seg><seg type="columnLine">this Sylvester--telling him nothing. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">far we have done but little, but soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will go to London and get busy, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">more men to help me. But 1 have to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">your options, of course, and, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you want to sell--bought them for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason.	*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose you transfer all you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to me and go out and get all you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">in addition--I will agree to take all you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can get. But, first, can you guarantee</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a transfer from your option-forms to</seg><seg type="columnLine">these--which are perhaps more generous?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He handed Williams a printed option-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, which the captain read rapidly. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had Thought no options, he naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no objection to saying he could use</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will buy," Smith was saying, "at ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">shillings a ton for six months from date of</seg><seg type="columnLine">transfer to me. You can make your com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission and profit from the difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the ten shillings and what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to pay, can you not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams thought rapidly. His numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversations with other shipmasters had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given him much inside information about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the losses of many firms of ship-owners,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart from what was general knowledge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had no doubt that many were anxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sell and would welcome the chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a few shillings a ton for options. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, too, that his credit and reputation</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood very high with Smith--Sylvester's</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary agitation had seen to that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the way, why had Sylvester been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">upset? He questioned Smith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh," Smith's face hardened with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious expression, "oh, he was just scared</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were going to cut in on him; that's all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He became silent, as if with the suspicion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Sylvester knew more than he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How much will you agree to deliver?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith seemed anxious to keep to business</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get the matter settled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> YVilliams breathed deeply. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his first plunge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I can promise a hundred thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons if you will agree to take all I can get</seg><seg type="columnLine">over that at ten shillings a ton. Purchase</seg><seg type="columnLine">price to be not more than an advance of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth of insured value."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you sign a binding contract to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect, agreeing to pay me ten shillings a ton</seg><seg type="columnLine">damages for all of the hundred thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">you fail to deliver?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got a copy of that contract?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From among his many printed forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith produced a blank contract, pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the various clauses. It was a clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and concise form.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will have thirty days in which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliver a hundred thousand tons to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each option to run for six months from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">date it is signed. Is all that satisfactory?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Seems so," Williams spoke slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am to contract to deliver to you options</seg><seg type="columnLine">for six months on a hundred thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons of Ai steamers, no ship to be less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">twentv-five-hundred tons, net, at ten shil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lings a ton to me. The options to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawTi on your forms, which you supply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I fail to deliver, I am to pay you ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">shillings a ton for all I lack of the hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand. You also agree to buy, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same terms, all over the hundred thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I can get hold of?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That last may be canceled at any time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, wlien we get all w'e want," supple-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented Smith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure--you're not buying all the earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know that. Of course, you know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I already have most of that hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand. The options are with my lawyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in London; so all I have to do is transfer</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from my forms to yours. I got them</seg><seg type="columnLine">for longer than six months; so that's easy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the final buyer in all cases, at no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a fourth in excess of insured value,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to be J. P. Smith, not the firm, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't talk like that," snapped Smith.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're not supposed to know about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm, vou know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Mr. Smith/; Williams re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted, "but I do know this: that, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the firm has lots of money, you may not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have. I have only your word, you knowr,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you represent them. If you want me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sign this contract--it means a lot to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Touching the Perils</seg><seg type="columnLine">81</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'm financially responsible, you know--</seg><seg type="columnLine">you must show me you do represent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm. That is, you must show me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">color of your money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Which was rather a neat speech for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with less than a shilling in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a hotel bill of about seven pounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Smith was all smiles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear fellow, 1 didn't mean to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">offensive. Of course you shall have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. I meant cash, anyhow. I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about you, and I want those options.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come over to the bank and sign the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tract. If the fifty is not enough, you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">have all the cash you need. Sylvester told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that you had tied up most of your loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">capital--quite a lot in those options, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, fifty will do," Williams spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely, having decided to let Smith run</seg><seg type="columnLine">things at this stage, because his own knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of finance was hardly sufficient to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">him lead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the bank the contract was signed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">duplicate and duly witnessed. Then Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed Williams a check, and the husky</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailor came nearer to fainting than ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">before during his twenty-seven years. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams had expected fifty pounds as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of binder, and the check was for fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through a sort of fog he heard Smith:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will deliver the options to my bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">in London as fast as you get them. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the address. I will be in London myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly, as I said. Good luck to you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because I don't want damages but options."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll get them, all right," mumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams, marveling at his first experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wonders of good credit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet it was all simple enough. Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed that Williams already had some</seg><seg type="columnLine">options and could get more, and he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Sylvester--and Sylvester dared not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool Smith--had rated Williams as first-</seg><seg type="columnLine">class credit. What more natural than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith should imagine it good business to tie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams to a contract and pay cash?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams was safe, and, if he failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliver, it simply meant the return of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unused money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Besides, Mr. Smith knew a lot of things</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he knew Williams could not know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if he were willing to believe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain knew who the final buyer would be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew, for instance, that Williams could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know why the firm was buying ships.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Which reason Smith knew warranted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking chances with much larger sums than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had given to the supposedly responsible</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, the firm, doing business in a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, load, of course, its owti corps of private</seg><seg type="columnLine">detectives and kept a line on every man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with whom it did business. Williams never</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that the charming American girl who</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his voyage to London so pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and who put Mrs. Silas entirely out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind was Mrs. Smith minus her wredding-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring--who had been set to keep track of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">doings until the last option had been de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">livered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Yellow' Star Navigation Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany was in bad shape, and the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its not being alone in its trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not compensate it for its difficulties.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Freights were so low that the twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">freighters sailing with the yellow' star on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their funnels might as wrell have traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ballast for any profit they made. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pilling Brothers, sole owners, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">inherited the business from their father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw only ruin ahead unless they could sell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But who would buy, with the books showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a loss for many months and practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">every ship-owner in the United Kingdom</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ships listed in the brokers' offices?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This being their mental and financial</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude, it was no wonder they almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted the cessation of miracles when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Williams--looking tremendous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prosperous in his new, shiny top-hat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">frock coat--walked into their office, smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasantly and told them he wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">purchase a few steamers. Could they</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblige him by selling?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They, of course, hadn't thought of doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a thing. They owned twrenty of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetest tramps on the seas, and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sentimental value about every keel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because their dead father had laid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foundations of the business. Besides, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't an idle vessel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Williams was very sorry, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he intimated that he was willing to buy a</seg><seg type="columnLine">six-months option on the twenty vessels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at five shillings a ton. The purchase price</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be one-sixth in advance of the insured</seg><seg type="columnLine">value.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Pilling Brothers, gasping like men</seg><seg type="columnLine">learning to swim in cold w&gt;ater, managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask for a few minutes alone so that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">82</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">could consider the offer. Williams pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a new watch, mentioned that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very busy, that opiious could be picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, he believed, at even better terms, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he would wait live minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, the total tonnage of the Yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Star Line amounted to eighty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons. Consequently, Williams had offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Fillings twenty thousand pounds lor</seg><seg type="columnLine">the privilege of buying the twenty ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">any time during the next six months.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ll' he did not buy, the twenty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a clear gain to the Fillings; if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he bought, it meant that they could sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">out at about what the ships had cost them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all very satisfactory if the man were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sane and responsible. For, with shipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions what they were, what on earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rather water, did a man want to buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">options for?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The form was liberal, too. Thirty days</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice, charters to be taken over if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not fulfilled, but no charter for longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than usual voyage to be signed during</seg><seg type="columnLine">option, and steamers to be delivered at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">port to be later designated. Ten days in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that port for inspection, during which</seg><seg type="columnLine">demurrage would be paid by prospective</seg><seg type="columnLine">buyer. Option money not to count toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">purchase price. Yes, it was very satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">factory, if the man were responsible. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he were, well, it was his money, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could spend it on wine, women, song or</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships--and the least wise investment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four would be ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Pillings looked back on many a</seg><seg type="columnLine">headache that lacked the pleasant memories</seg><seg type="columnLine">of either song, sips or kisses but only reeked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with columns of figures, crowding like dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted humans to the left side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledger. Yes, they would sell the options.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The terms alter calling wrere very liberal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the purchase price was satisfactory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They never tried to bargain. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">too anxious, too much afraid the large</seg><seg type="columnLine">angel might go elsewhere for his options.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The buyer was J. P. Smith. So, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Williams was his agent. Well and</seg><seg type="columnLine">good. So, with details which may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">omitted, the deal was closed, and Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">delivered eighty thousand tons of ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">options to Smith's bank, clearing for himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">the decent profit of twenty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds. There was still in his possession</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten thousand pounds cf Smith's check,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he intended to put to the credit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silas Rutherford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This notion amused him. Since his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">birth he had so expanded that he felt too</seg><seg type="columnLine">big for any petty revenge. Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wouldn't mind doing tome tiling big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus making the woman sorry she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned him down. Hut nothing petty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, he wanted to earn some more</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, and he felt sure that Silas would</seg><seg type="columnLine">sell. Thus he thought, very contented,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a^ the train whirled him north to the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Silas Rutherford, looking forward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interview. The old man would cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly be startled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the black town, enveloped him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain degree of nervousness as its grimy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlying suburbs began to throw their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacle-like streets about the railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">track, slowing the train. He had to light</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the heart-beats roused by the asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciation of ideas, forcing himself to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon bis love for the woman as if it were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgusting disease, stripping her of the halo</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which he had once endowed her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing her as "a rag and a bone and a hank</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hair" --and not too clean hair or rags</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that. And finally, when the train</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the station, he achieved calm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was satisfaction about signing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">name in the register of the best hotel, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tall liat somewhat on the back of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. Then, wisely, he took a cab to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office of a first-class lawyer, told him about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loss of the Psyche, omitting no details</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaving a handsome retainer against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the possible Board of Trade investigation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, however, would be unlikely to drag</seg><seg type="columnLine">in anything about liis crime. But it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">best to play safe. He could put up good</seg><seg type="columnLine">bail, if the wrorst happened, and leave Silas</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold the bag as he deserved. For Silas</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not in the happy position of having</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his assets comfortably stowed in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast pocket and could never make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">run for it, because he was anchored to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his investments by the steel cable of miser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Worse, the poor old fool was stranded</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the shoals of matrimony, unable to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the open sea and safety, with a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraping at a hole in his ribs with every' lift</seg><seg type="columnLine">and settle he made to the tide of life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams, reveling in his metaphofs, began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to realize the benefits of freedom and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel that what he had taken for the shackles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of love was mere tissue-paper disguised in</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinfoil. He devoured an excellent dinner</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked happily through the smoky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Touching the Perils</seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg><seg type="columnLine">early dark of September, puffing no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a pipe but at a two-shilling cigar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was after office hours, but Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">had waited purposely, knowing the ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Silas and wanting to meet him when</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. Of course, there was the chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his staying home, now that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">married. But the captain thought other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise, remembering cynically that the wed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding had occurred some weeks before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he was right. True, for a few days</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man had lingered by his fireside--at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, rather, for Silas allowed no heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his house before late October--but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had soon pleaded the call of business and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone back to his old habit of sitting in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely office, bemoaning liis unlucky invest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in ships. And his wife had made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">objection. She had pretended, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but had secretly rejoiced when he left her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Williams, stepping quietly, found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer door open and went in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused to think for a moment on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of times he had entered that office</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of a craven fear that he might lose his</seg><seg type="columnLine">job. Then he squared hi? shoulders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went forward, still so quiet that Silas did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hear him but saw him framed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway of the private office when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to look up. And for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man imagined he was looking at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the captain shut the door, sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the desk and lit another cigar, but he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not remove his shiny hat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't expect to see me, did you, you old</seg><seg type="columnLine">thief?" he began pleasantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silas made no reply. Williams was cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly not a ghost, but he was decidedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">an apparition--what with the frock coat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tall hat, the jewelry, the cigar and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">above all, the assured manner. He was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlike the old Williams that he was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">just recognizable as that person. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first coherent thought of Silas was the wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Williams had always been as he then</seg><seg type="columnLine">was--in which case the woman would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">never thrown him down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't need that dirty four hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fifty--I'm a rich man now--but I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to make you sorry for what you did."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sorry, Williams, very sorry." And</seg><seg type="columnLine">so full of truth was the old voice that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain believed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I mean it. But not about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. You wouldn't believe me if I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was sorry about the moneys and I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame you. But I'll give you a check for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that right away, Williams. I wish I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">give you back all I robbed you of so easily."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked so old, seemed so tired, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly disappointed with life, that Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams, who had come in anger, became</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathetic. He watched the veined,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling hand writing the check and</seg><seg type="columnLine">coughed to hide an unexpected swell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Williams--" the old man handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain the check--"maybe I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone too long; maybe I was never meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a married man, and maybe I got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong sort of a woman. But, just as I sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, she sits at home-1-! want my ships to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sink; she wants me to die. And I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave her my money. It don't seem right</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to, does it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is a clannishness about sex. Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams had gone to Silas with anything but</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly feelings, but now he found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking sides with him--against the woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "If I was you, I'd give her fifty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tell her to get a divorce. Get drunk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell her to have witnesses and take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange woman home with you some night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She'd jump at the chance to cry in court.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's the best wray out of it--infidelity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruelty, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," wailed Silas, "I'm a deacon of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">church--have been for forty-odd years."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's the devil how a man's youthful</seg><seg type="columnLine">follies dog liis life, isn't it?" answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams gravely. "But I wouldn't let</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stop me. You can easily square the</seg><seg type="columnLine">church with a fat check and a public con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fession of sin. Weep a bit and beg 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take you back into the fold. They''11</seg><seg type="columnLine">like you all the better for it. It's a cinch."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The old man brightened; then he became</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhappy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But think of the expense, W'illiams;</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of the expense," he groaned. "With</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipping the way it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, as to that, I can help you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">W'illiams exclaimed as if the idea had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to him. "I have come into a tidy</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of money, you see. Not got it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the courts yet, but got a good bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. I've always wanted to be a ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner--all skippers do--and I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder if things looked up soon. As I said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I	can not get hold of all my money just nowr,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I'll pay you five shillings a ton for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">option to purchase your seven ships, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">their insured value. Option to run for six</seg><seg type="columnLine">months."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sav that all over again," the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly screamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     WILLIAMS repealed his statement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the old man began to think, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look for a trap. This looked too good</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be true, but, then, Williams always was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fool, and, if he wanted to tie up his inheri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance in ships, that was his lookout. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no way Sikte could be cheated if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks to me like a temporary drop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's all," he said oihly. "It wouldn't sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize me a bit to see freights take a big jump</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty soon. Who left you the money?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None of your bally business," snarled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams. "And you can't fool me about</seg><seg type="columnLine">freights going up. Me and my partner</seg><seg type="columnLine">want seven steamers. If you won't sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the price I mentioned--the option is</seg><seg type="columnLine">because my money may be six months</seg><seg type="columnLine">before getting through the court--I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily get some one who will. Now, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you going to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Price is till right if the form is." Silas</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke hastily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would never do to let this golden oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity get aw'ay from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams gave him one of Smith's printed</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms, and the old man read and rereau it</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tliat's all right and regular. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be buying from more than me to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the expense of getting these special forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">printed. But I ought to get more than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insured value."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Y'ou can either take what I offered or</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep your ships," Williams retorted, deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined to keep Silas down to the price,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although the agreement with Smith per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted him a fairly wide margin above it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And finally Silas agreed, very inquisitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Smith party and the source of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inheritance--a curiosity Williams did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And finally the captain left the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">without troubling to see the woman he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had once adored and unaware that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had waited for him every day after her</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband had told her about his wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">change in condition and circumstance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He left without being troubled by the Board</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Trade, feeling sorry for Silas. Asa matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fact, he was doing too wrell to hate any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, for a telegram from Smith in Loudon</seg><seg type="columnLine">liad invited him to dinner and to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the options with him he might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in buying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Smith was radiant. Admitting that</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything was going splendidly, he paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams for his options and promised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay for any more he could get. The con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tract, which had been carried out, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned. Then they dined in a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Williams had only heard about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in his new dress-suit he acted as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had eaten in such places ever since he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began on solid food. And the wine flowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">very freely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can get you more options yet," prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised Williams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excellent, my dear friend, excellent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you want die money now or when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliver?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord," Williams grinned expansively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some curious intuition making him pretend</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the wine had affected liim more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">it really had. "Lord. I can trust you. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">are all in die same boat, aren't we?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith smiled as one knowing himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sober smiles at one he imagines to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he murmured, "all in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, my dear Williams, but we didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">all get into the boat the same way, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">we?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> W'illiams laughed fatuously. Then, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice rather hoarse:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, w*e did not. You know how I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. How did you--pier-head jump or first-</seg><seg type="columnLine">class passenger?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was hardly a polite question, not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">politely worded quesrion. but Smith merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the bottle and smiled again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"As if you didn't know?'' he suggested.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh," Williams felt very much as when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he first talked to the scorpion--as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were trying to find his way in the dark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, I suppose you were bom that way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 11	w'as a silly remark, but Smith glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him keenly--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think so?'' he asked shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Know it. just as I know that I wasn't."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're a clever man." Smith com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plimented. "Far more so than even I at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first believed." He spoke thoughtfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But we are the best of friends and can</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust one anodier. Tell me, how did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out that Sylvester was buying options--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gib's a queer place, in a way, for that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And how did you discover who is to be die</seg><seg type="columnLine">final buyer--who are the firm, eh?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Touching the Perils</seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams fumbled with the tip of a cigar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then clumsily bit it, again laughing foolishly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know, Smith/' he went on with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">portentous gravity of the intoxicated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm a good Englishman, but I ain't a fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. There's lots of people don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to see an English ship sold to foreigners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I don't care if the red ensign is changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Hottentot flag, if I can make money</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of it. Did you say the Czar of Russia</seg><seg type="columnLine">was president of the firm? Would you say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I wouldn't, but I will say you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk," Smith spoke impatiently. "What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the use of all this fencing about the thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As you'll find when you try to buy, we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up about all the options we want.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You know as well as I do that American</seg><seg type="columnLine">capital is behind this buying. Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had to keep it quiet and don't intend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk now, but it was kind of annoying</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you and me to pretend there was a mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery about it. You knew from the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting that I was an American, just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know that America has been sorry</seg><seg type="columnLine">she hadn't a merchant fleet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where you got the hint I do not know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you knew America lacked building</seg><seg type="columnLine">facilities and that it would be cheaper to</seg><seg type="columnLine">buy from the British, especially with</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipping on the blink, as it has been.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, it would have taken too long to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have built our own fleet.

Better become an</seg><seg type="columnLine">American citizen, old man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams' head sank forward as if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling asleep, and Smith raised his hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake him into wakefulness, muttering--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wonder if he only guessed--knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that America was the only place with</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough private capital to swing such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">, V</seg><seg type="columnLine">SO THAT was it. What a blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">bat he had been not to see through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scheme, Williams, still pretend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing drunkenness, thought as Smith saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his room. But it was all right. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">Americans wanted to buy what the" British</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to sell, whose business was it? Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, there would be a howi from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">press. But why couldn't the British ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">owners have thought of a gigantic combine</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would have given them powrer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make their own freight rates as the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">buyers intended to do? Well, let them</seg><seg type="columnLine">howl. They needed waking up in England.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith, leaving London the next day</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some place he did not mention, called</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say good-by and to remind Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his promise to say nothing about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big deal until it was consummated. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Williams promised readily enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith rewarded him with the advice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be wrasting his lime to look for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more options. There might be one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships not tied up wrhich the owners were</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to sell, but he doubted it. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams found he was right. Liverpool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">London, Belfast--every shipping town in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kingdom was visited by the captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But not a single option could he purchase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whew, some deal," he muttered as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of the thing dawned upon him. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can't kick. It helped me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he decided to visit the town of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">birth and indulge in a gentle spree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the spree did not stop at the gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage. It developed into the most involved</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience of its kind in the captain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventful life. Famous among his brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers for his capacity, he was now finan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially able to do himself proud. So, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had hajd enough of it, what with the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">consumed running about England looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for options and the time taken up by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable dissipation, some months had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed since his farewell with Smith. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">events had occurred w'hich the captain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never a reading man, had not heard about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For whenev er a boon companion had at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to discuss the news of the day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams had choked him off with more</seg><seg type="columnLine">palatable suggestion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus it happened, when coming out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Turkish bath, he encountered one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pilling brothers, who looked as if he. also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had indulged freely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Been having a good time?" asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jovial captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have.

Presently an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man sat down by his side and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">read a newspaper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Terrible time coming," remarked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man after a while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?" drawled Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">indifferently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What do I mean?" The old was</seg><seg type="columnLine">annoyed. "Well, I'll explain, if you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see it for yourself. It means war.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That shooting of the archduke was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">starter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh?" The captain dimly remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing of that affair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," went on the other, "I believe it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was arranged. Those Germans would do</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything.

But we'll be into it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll see that. And the Germans will find</seg><seg type="columnLine">some way of starving us out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh?" Williams was interested at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, they will. Cunning devils. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not tell them from Englishmen or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Americans; they speak the language so</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. Starve us out, they will. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country's full of them-4ill spies. Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there goes one of them now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams stared at the well-dressed man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the single, eyeglass w'ho walked slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">past them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you know he's a German?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That scar--on his cheek--look, quick,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissed the old man. "They get them</seg><seg type="columnLine">dueling."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Williams sat as if petrified.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then with an oath he jumped to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began to run toward the railway</seg><seg type="columnLine">station, leaving the astounded old gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to speculate upon his sanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Captain Williams was quite sane--</seg><seg type="columnLine">as sane, if not more so, than ever before</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his life--even if his mind was racing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">maddening thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For it w*as all clear now. He saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme from the very beginning. Yet its</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleverness might w'ell have been too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the brightest of men. Sylvester had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been scared because he had guessed--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew--that Smith was a German--or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more likely, he w-as really a German spy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and afraid of being discovered by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">British. For Gib. is a had place for cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured spies. Besides, Sylvester was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">British subject--consequently, if be were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spy, he was also a traitor. Which ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained his agitation and Smith's curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression when Williams had referred to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And how careless Smith had been about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the price to be paid for the steamers on</seg><seg type="columnLine">delivery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lie had hardly mentioned it, allowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams to suggest the price. No wonder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he knew that there was no intention</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paying any delivery money. And how</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy Smith had been about parting with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty thousand. Of course, such a tiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">might happen in business, and the contract</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed by Williams in the Gibraltar bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">had mentioned everything, gone into all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the usual clauses, such as bottomry' bonds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">attachments and the like. How Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have smiled at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What did he care about attachments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">once the ships were delivered into German</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports? And wiiat was fifty thousand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a deal--when the option money was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that they were going to pay? Oh, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sawr it. He saw it. And the options were</seg><seg type="columnLine">called. Options on at least eight-tenths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shipping of the British Empire. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eve of war they were being delivered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">German ports. The old man on the bench</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said that Germany was only waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">till some prearranged moment before de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claring war, and Williams believed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But would any one else believe?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By God, he would force them to! Eight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenths of British shipping lured into Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man ports for ten shillings or less a ton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams had given little heed that after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon w'hen Pilling had told him that all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships were to be delivered in Hamburg</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the ships of other owners who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sold options were going to Bremen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamburg and other German ports. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heeded now. Why, in a week or so all</seg><seg type="columnLine">those ships would be in German ports,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, while the owners waited for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, war would come! How cunning</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time arrangement, which could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended on excuse, with liberal demurrage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Santanta</seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cunning. And the cunning of Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the last. He had known Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pretending to be drunk, and, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook him in the restaurant, he had spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he believed he were speaking to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunken man--must have "guessed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">America was the only country with enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">private capital to swing such a deal."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cunning. Yes, he had been cunning. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man had not called attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the scar on the face of that passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">German or if that German had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed at the time--but for that, Germany</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have starved England into sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">render in a few weeks. On what tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">incidents do the fates of empires hang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But would others believe as Williams be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Running frantically along the platform,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tall hat in his waving hand, the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">just caught the train. But would lie be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time? Would he be believed? Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the options--that could be proved--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but about the certainty of war? There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no sense in senamg a telegram. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be considered crazy and arrested.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there was only one man to see--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prime Minister. But whsft could the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minister do, even if Williams made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that the option-buying was a war</seg><seg type="columnLine">move?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain had no idea, but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">great faith in that important official. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would see him--even if he had to fight his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to him. The shipping of the empire</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricked irfto Germany's ports--at ten shil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lings or less a ton. Yes, they were clever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But for the scar he would never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed it. Slice-bar,-! He had thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a queer, unhandy sort of weapon when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith had told him the lie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams did not sleep that night, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when in the very early morning he reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">London, he raced to the first taxi on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, shouting to the surprized driver--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Number 10 Downing Street, and drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">like-!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the minister's servants were also</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprized. They were accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cranks of all sorts, but this big man seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">different. He didn't shout or rave, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his low, tense voice was commanding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still, they couldn't let him in. It was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">early, they explained. Would he come</seg><seg type="columnLine">again later? Later they would be pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Williams refused to come later. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to see the Prime Minister right</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. If he were still in bed, he must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">wakened. The matter could not wait.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he made as if to push by them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The servants looked at one another--</seg><seg type="columnLine">two big footmen, but neither of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to tackle this big madman. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a sign--phone the police while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the fellow off with talk. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain saw the sign and guessed its mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. With head down--top hat still in</seg><seg type="columnLine">place--he was preparing to charge as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have charged refractory sailors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when another voice broke in--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, James?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Williams saw the Prime Minister</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming dqwn the hall. He never remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered how he obtained that interview.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His torrent of words was beyond his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol.

But, about the time I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded to remove my coat as my employer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and everybody else had done, we arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">in higher regions, and I preserved my self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect, sor.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">landlord instructed me in misan' many</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamerican drinks next mornin'. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">daytime 'twas mostly lydies who frequented</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pool-room, playin' lhe game very skill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, 1 should say, but I gathered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their conversation that Saturdays and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sundays were much enlivened by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of husbands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an extraordinary quiet spot, sor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my word! I anticipated much from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected arrival towards evening of a favor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ite visitor, a newspaper-man from Newark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Province of New Jersey, by name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mack, who was an inveterate joker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gathered the idea that he was some sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a big mogul from hearing Mrs. Degraw</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell another lydy that Mack was a prince;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was a genuine Indian. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">charmed at the idea, don't you know, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountering one of the aboriginal princes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Mr. Degraw had told me that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly passing away because of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">adoption of the vice of dgaret smoking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an orfal hot day, incredible hot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor, witherin', as you might sav, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody seemed to mind it. Actually, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landlord's wife had worn a beaver' cape</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her shoulders that mornin'. 'Twas</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighty six at three o'clock when Mr. Mack</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his friends arrived, bringing with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their entertainment, a brass hand of five</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. He was a man in his forties, fat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark-haired, with piercing brown eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a grand out jutting nose. But his skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as fair as your own, sor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, he had the gloomy stem look that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one naturally would expect in an Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief, and the preposterous heat seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have no effect upon him or his friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">except to give 'em a thirst. He was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">affable indeed--no royal airs at all--and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked me manny questions about the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">counthry after the landlord told him I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Ireland--especially about banshees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pLxies and the likes o' that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was two of them that hadn't come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by name of O'Toole and O'Keefe, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept by other ingagements until night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they were cornin' by carriage, a fifty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile trip!

I asked Mr. Degraw what his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Highness preferred in the way of liquor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What d've mean, Highness?" says he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Indian prince, sor.

Sor, I can feel at this minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deadly chill that struck down my</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs as he reached the squirmin' sarpent</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward me!

And, sor, I heard some shockin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">details of crime. But Degratv only laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said it was lucky for them that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeds had been outlawed by the Immunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">Act, or they'd be dissolving in quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lime that very hour. And a milder-lookin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of blokes you couldn't have found on</seg><seg type="columnLine">anny Summer night the world over!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every onct in a while somebody would</seg><seg type="columnLine">regret the absince of O'Toole and O'Keefe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that would start another story about</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or the other of these men, something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would start off innocint, belike, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind up with the creeps in your liver, sor!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "D'ye mind," says one, "the time they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole the red-hot stove from the Mamin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Register Office and piled pavin' stones agin</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door and sat there in the snow-storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">till daylight drinkin' applejack while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police was cartin' away the stones, afraid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meddle with 'em?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do that!" says the prince. " 'Twas</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very next day that O'Keefe attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with a Cuban machete in Murray's</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon, and I had to lay him out with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brass cuspidor. I carry the scar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut he gave me to this day. But those</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rough old times! You remember the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night O'Toole got the cab-drivers into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mink's to buy them a drink and we stole</seg><seg type="columnLine">every cab in Newark and drove to Belleville</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. That was awful! O'Keefe had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no excuse for killin' the mayor of Belleville,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if it was a Prohibition town!" says</seg><seg type="columnLine">another chap. "Just because the mayor</seg><seg type="columnLine">called him a white-livered Home Rule mick</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Galway! T wasn't right!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You may see, sor, that I did not regret</seg><seg type="columnLine">the absince of these two men from this</seg><seg type="columnLine">social gatherin', for I could readily perceive</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were desperate characters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">type depicted by Bret Harrte in his " Jumpin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frog" stories, although I gathered that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were Irishmen of a sort. But a bit later</seg><seg type="columnLine">we heard shots in the distance, and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately afterward came the two des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peraydoes in the vehicle they call by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious name of "buggy," sor. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them--that was O'Toole--was a small, red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed, skinny chap with a mild eye, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">verry last you'd take for a bad one, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other was more like a parson than a hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened murderer, a fine, tall, clean-lookin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad with curly hair but very profane with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his language.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurroo! We did the fifty miles in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a half hours, swoppin' horses every five</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles!" sings out O'Keefe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a liar. It can't be did!" says</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prince.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're no gentleman, you decrepit old</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse-thief. It was did!" says O'Toole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbin' down in a hurry. "We'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the constables of nine towns after us for</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting up each burg we passed through!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">They all crowded indoors, and O'Keefe</seg><seg type="columnLine">yells out:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rum! Rum! And a bucket of blood!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Degraw whispers to me:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be discreet, me boy, in talkin' to these</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds. They've been drinkin' some; I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that. We don't want anv trouble here</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give us a couple of nitroglvcerin cock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails!" yells O'Keefe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are all out of nitroglycerin," says</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Degraw very smooth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">92</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nix! Nix! None of that stuff!" O'Toole</seg><seg type="columnLine">bawls out, and the man reaches for his hip</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket, his little eyes blazin'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on! Don't draw, for you might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to shoot ! ' says Degraw as cool as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">please. "I may have some up at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went after it, and he was gone-some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. The prince motioned O'Toole to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come outside, and I could see him talkin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnestly to him in the light from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway. 1 conjectured that he was ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visin' him to act with discretion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, sor, if I could have been whisked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out o' that and over to old Ireland by</seg><seg type="columnLine">givin' up ten years o' my life, I'd gladly</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done it! Every time O'Toole's eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested on me, ray insides froze--and 'twas</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hot night, d'ye mind! When Mr. Degraw</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back, he had a tumbler half full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some white stuff that he hands to O'Toole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and says he:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's your soul-poisoner, and may you</seg><seg type="columnLine">choke! I had to steal it from under old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duy Foster's bed while he was asleep. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd woke up, he would have bored me!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Toole takes it, and says he:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None of your tricks! Are you sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're not trying to slip over some of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">turpentine flavorin' or French perfume like</seg><seg type="columnLine">you did the last time!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Taste it, you rattlesnake!" says Degraw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Toole tasted it, smiled and passed it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Tis the real old safe-blowin' juice--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh!" says he. "Mix the cocktails--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all hands, d'ye mind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they all began to protest that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't drink that deadly stuff, but O'Keefe</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulls out a pistol, sor. and, when the drinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mixed, they drank them without</seg><seg type="columnLine">objectin'. O'Toole shook his head with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth wide open, and says he, "Boys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I gritted my teeth, I'd blast my jaw off!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now it's whisky and other soft stuff that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll have to stick to tonight. O'Keefe, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">play you a game of pool, though my hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">are raw from drivin' them fiery, untamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">steeds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that they went to playing pool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">me v'atchin' them, and divvle a one of 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">was showin' any effects from drinkin' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff, sor! The prince whispered to De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graw, and he came to me and told me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">water some whisky in a bottle and serve</seg><seg type="columnLine">these two with it as they were like to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. I done that same, and the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">next time they took a drink they spat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked hard at me. My blood' turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice, sor! O'Toole put his hand across</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe's chest, and says he:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on, John, no killin'! Mabbe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy has a mother as you had onct."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Since when has a mere mother--or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mother-in-law, for the matter o' that-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped you or me, Petey O'Toole! He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">watered our booze!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole crowd threw themselves on</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and Degraw told them I'd given</seg><seg type="columnLine">them whisky out of the bottle reserved for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man with delirium trimmins that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarding there. Finally O'Keefe calmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and went back to the pool-table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The prince called on the band for music.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see that there was bad blood between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two, and I never took my eyes off them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor. In the midst of the music they began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to quarrel over the game, callin' each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">mortal bad names. Just as the band</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped playin', O'Keefe shook his fist</seg><seg type="columnLine">in O'Toole's face, and says he--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You half-portion of a Hackensack</seg><seg type="columnLine">coprolite!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I mind the word well. O'Toole stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, pulled out a revolver and with a yell</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired straight at O'Keefe's stomach, not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard away! He fell without a word--just</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumpled up, dropped on his face, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and lay still there beside the pool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">EVEN in that horrible moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor, 1 noticed that all of them turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked at me instead of at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderer. That is, all except the German</seg><seg type="columnLine">band, who were too frightened to move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Toole dropped the pistol and darted out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the darkness, but-the crowd fell over</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other to get out after him. I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not feel that it was my duty to join them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I was a foreigner, don't you know, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would have been of no service as I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly funked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I suppose I was as pale as the band-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader, who sat staring at the corpse in</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror. One man soon returned and asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">me where he could get a rope to hang the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderer with when they caught him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before I could reply, he took down Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Degraw's beaver cape that hung on a peg</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the wall and covered up the head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders of the dead man in a solemn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reverent manner that quite touched me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Night in the Wilderness</seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could hear them yellin' and makin</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncouth sounds in the distance for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time as they searched, but soon they all</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted in--all but the prince and Degraw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They told me that these two, who were old</seg><seg type="columnLine">woodsmen, would soon round up the black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearted spalpeen and bring him back dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">or alive. The prince, they said, was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to kill him first and ask questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward. They told me to remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">every detail, for I w'ould be the most im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant witness, and this made me very</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous. Every few minutes one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them were compelled by their emotions</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly there came a wild, thrillin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">yell from out of the dark, starless night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Out they rushed. Between the dead man</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside and a murderer loose outside I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">like siftin' tight, sor. When they came in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had the artist chap, drippin' wet, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that he had been pushed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake by some unseen hand. lie thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was O'Toole's. I was much upset by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their indecent levity, sor, for they split</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sides at his misfortune even in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of the corpse. It was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">shockin'!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> None of them knew the bally counthry</seg><seg type="columnLine">about there, and they were afraid of bein'</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in the dark. Besides, O'Toole was</seg><seg type="columnLine">well armed, having another pistol besides</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one he had dropped, as I omitted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mention, beside the corpse and which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been laid behind the bar right near me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which increased my nervous horrors. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew so many details about the lives of</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Toole and O'Keefe and related so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, sor, that I was really made</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite ill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally along about midnight a loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">war-whoop that chilled my veins called</seg><seg type="columnLine">them out, and soon they returned with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">villain O'Toole. They had evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">handled him roughly enough, and Sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">Degraw had handcuffed him so that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite harmless, as you might say. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">glared at me as if about to spring at me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the artist chap got between us. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he says:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us give this fiend in human shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dose of lynch-law right here and now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">string him up. He's as guilty as-says</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, "and he's cheated the gallow's many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times already. You remember how he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">off after killing Lhe old woman over at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smoky Hollow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We do that," says the prince. "And do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you mind how he slipped out of the noose</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time he cut the throats of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">school-teachers in Goshen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure! He's a bally bad one!" gaid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff. "It's agin my oath of office to</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance such work, but we'll try him</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't you wait until tomorrow so I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">send for a lawyer?" asks O'Toole with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">groan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can not!" says the prince. "You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to play your hand alone this time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Petey, me boy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So they started to try him. They made</seg><seg type="columnLine">me give my testimony first. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweatin' job, sor, with O'Toole's devilish</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes burnin' holes into me bewhilst. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was through, Degraw says:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We saw it all. A hundred witnesses</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't add to the proof. We'll hang</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on young Jarvis' evidence alone."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's done for me!" says O'Toole. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky for him that this is a dirty lynch-law</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial, or I'd get him sure later: As it is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my spook will hant you, young feller, till</seg><seg type="columnLine">your dyin' day! May your food choke you!</seg><seg type="columnLine">May your booze taste like bilge-water!</seg><seg type="columnLine">May your feet be cold in Winter and roast</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Summer! And may your wife take your</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnings to Asbury Park!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be reasonable, O'Toole!'' says the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prince. "The boy's only done his duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the counthry-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's no better than a lousy informer!,,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries O'Toole. "Men, I ask you as a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal favor not to hang me like a horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thief! Shoot me and let me die like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">good old scout I am! O'Keefe only got</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was cornin' to him, and well he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served it. He stole both my wives. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgave him and, in fact, paid the carfare</seg><seg type="columnLine">on- one occasion. I overlooks his weakness</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he double-crossed me the time we</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbed the Prudential Bank and killed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old cashier, w'ho was my second-cousin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he wrent too far for human endurance</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night he set the opera house on fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">and burned up ninety-six women and</seg><seg type="columnLine">children!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! Did he do that deed?" asks</seg><seg type="columnLine">Degraw. He was that overcome he leans</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the shoulder of the prince, and both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were sobbin', sor. But the prince</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a deep frown says:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Raw stuff, Pete3', and old! This isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Newark jury."</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take off these cuffs and shoot me</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick!" says the man. "I have thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars in me jeans.

I'll match you for the thirty!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Degraw took off the handcuffs and says,</seg><seg type="columnLine">says he:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, stand over here by the corpse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jarvis, you hand me that gun on the shelf</seg><seg type="columnLine">yonder. I'll shoot you myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Faith, I was mighty slow in reachin' for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weapon, as you may well believe, sor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, before I laid my hand on it, O'Toole</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped through the door like a bloomin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbit and was gone wid the whole pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him, yellin' like fiends! All, that is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the artist chap, and he says in great</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hide behind the bar, lad! You're as</seg><seg type="columnLine">good as dead if he doubles back in the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get you! It was your evidence that</seg><seg type="columnLine">convicted him, and he'll take a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pay ypu back!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I laid myself down behind the bar, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there I stayed until they all returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll put the bloodhounds on his trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning--if I can finish with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">havin'," says the sheriff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's on my mind that he'll drown hisself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lake," says the prince. "He'll never</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to survive the loss of O'Keefe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were partners in crime for many years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and O'Keefe's ghost will hant him until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he makes away with hisself--you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">gamble on that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then the bandmaster stands up</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather unsteadily, and says he--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vot iss the matter mil playin' a dirge</seg><seg type="columnLine">for dot dead man, alretty?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a splendid idea.

But the prince spoiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all by ordering drinks, and then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed me. Degraw came behind the bar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and says he--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what do you there?" he asks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They say he's apt to come back for me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">says I.

I stood up and grabbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol just as he leaps into the room. Sor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 was that scared 1 points the gun straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his chest and fires, but he never turns</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hair! I never fired a pistol before in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, and 1 expected to see him drop at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. But instead he steps up and says:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'd do better work with a brick!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gimme a drink, you poor boob!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I drops the gun and hands him the bottle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there he stood drinkin' out of it when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gang rushes back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boys, I give up!" he sings out.

BRININSTOOL</seg><seg type="columnLine">U[QUESTIONABLY the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle between white men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians ever fought in the West--</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking into consideration the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small number of whites and the awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">death-toll they inflicted--was what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">known historically as the W'agon-box</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight of August 2, 1867, which occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">some twenty miles southeast of the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">city of Sheridan, Wyoming, and about six</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from old Fort Phil Kearney, at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time one of the important military posts</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the new wagon road which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened by the Government to Bozeman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montana. In this fight, thirty-two sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diers and civilian wood-choppers, stationed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the fort, were surrounded in a corral</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of the beds of the wagons used in</seg><seg type="columnLine">transporting logs to the fort, by three</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand Sioux warriors under command</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Chief Red Cloud, and after a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific engagement lasting from about</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven in the morning until two or three</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the afternoon were relieved by a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tachment from the fort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The most amazing part of this fight is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that the whites lost but three men</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed and four or five wounded, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian loss, as acknowledged some years</seg><seg type="columnLine">later by Red Cloud, and verified from</seg><seg type="columnLine">other Indian sources, was 1137. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the first real battle between whites and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians in which breech-loading rifles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">used by the former against the bows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows and old-fashioned firearms of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In anticipation of a battle during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">process of cutting and transporting logs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fort to finish needed buildings, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes from fourteen wagons had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed and arranged in a semicircle on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the level plain a short distance from where</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wood-choppers were at work, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded at their task by soldiers from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort. Several extra rifles apiece and ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand rounds of ammunition were two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the reasons for the awful slaughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflicted by the soldiers and wood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">choppers. On the morning of August 2,</seg><seg type="columnLine">1807, the wood-choppers were barely at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their task when Indians by the hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarmed from the ravines and gullies</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the pine logs were being cut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the number at work, thirty-two man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to retreat in safety to the wagon-box</seg><seg type="columnLine">corral, where, under the command of Capt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">J.

Then a force of five hundred of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his leading warriors, mounted on their war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponies, detached themselves from the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">command and started for the little corral</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on the level plain. Whooping and yell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, on they came with ponies on the run.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not a shot was fired from the corral until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horde of screeching savages were within</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty yards, when a perfect sheet of flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringed the corral, and a rain of bullets was</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured into the advancing ranks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The firing was not one solid volley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, silence, as the Indians had anticipated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was a steady and persistent stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fire, which mowed them down in scores.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The astonished braves could not under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand the rapidity of the firing, knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of the new breech-loading arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been supplied to the soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a very few days before. In the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lhe corral where the brunt of the charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been met, horses and men were cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">down as by some giant mowing-machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dazed and chagrined by the failure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first charge, the Sioux fled back out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of range of those deadly rifles, where Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cloud consulted with other chiefs upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">another plan. Seven hundred Indians were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered to prepare themselves as a skirmish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing party.

The furniture consisted of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of chairs made of some hard, red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dish wood, crudely but fantastically car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ved. In the center of the room was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long table of pure ebony, its top polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a mirror finish. At one side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table sat the datto, and opposite him was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crawson, white man, renegade, commander-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in-chief of the datto1 s motley but vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">army.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the table between them stood a teak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood box which was about ten inches long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">six by six, bound with heavy iron bands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured with six powerful locks--two on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side and one at each end. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were also iron rings for handles at each end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The box had no hinges. To open it, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth, snug-fitting lid was merely lifted off</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all six locks had been unfastened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parang .produced a ring containing six</seg><seg type="columnLine">keys, unlocked each of the locks, lifted off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lid and burrowed his hand, wrist-deep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the contents five hundred thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars in jewels. There were diamonds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubies, pearls, emeralds and a plentiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixture of the other and less noted kinds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg><seg type="columnLine">The datto lifted his hand, palm up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly spread his fingers. There followed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shower Like the falling of varigated hail, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jewels dropped back into the box,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scintillating, flashing every color of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainbow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crawson gazed at the little pebbles</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungrily as they fell through the datto's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers, sparkling and flashing signals of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease, of creature comfort. Five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars in portable, disposable</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. In Sydney, in Paris, with that box</seg><seg type="columnLine">--what a life! Crawson had not been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sydney or in Paris, but he had imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave it free rein.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parang's small black eyes glowed fanat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ically. Here, indeed, was wealth to buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">many guns and more bullets with which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slay the hated Christians. The datto plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ned to unite the entire Moro forces and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweep the archipelago from Sulu to Luzon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drive out the Americans and enslave all</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christian natives. Crawson had made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe it possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In fact, it was Crawson who had origi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated the idea of accumulating a fund to</seg><seg type="columnLine">buy arms and ammunition. Shortly after he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had established himself as commander of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the datto's army, he laid before the latter his</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan for a systematic session of looting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be perpetrated in Mindanao, the proceeds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these incursions to be saved until the sum</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached a total of five hundred thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, sciior" protested the datto, "all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rice and bullocks and potatoes in Tawi</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tawi and Mindanao put together are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth five hundred thousand dollars."</seg><seg type="columnLine">98</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's just the trouble with you, Dal to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You think only of such cheap trash as rice</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bullocks and potatoes. Forget that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff and go after the big game. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these Catholic churches over iu Mindanao</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gold candlesticks and gold cups they</seg><seg type="columnLine">call chalices, and the padres have got all</seg><seg type="columnLine">kinds of gold money and precious stones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What we want to do is to rig up some good,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong double outriggers that will stand a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip from here to the coast of Mindanao, go</seg><seg type="columnLine">over in small parties and relieve these</seg><seg type="columnLine">church gentlemen of their wealth. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it from the poor dev ils over there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's past time that somebody took it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And another thing, Datto. Any of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">filibusters who'll be willing to run guns in</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to us won't be willing to accept Spanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">money or gold candlesticks. Either one</seg><seg type="columnLine">would create suspicion against them. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">convert everything into jewels--diamonds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubies, pearls and the like--and they'll take</seg><seg type="columnLine">those fast enough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The datto had fallen in readily enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">with both ideas. The outriggers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">built, and the business of robbing churches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost everything else was promptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun. The results were highly pleasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Crawson and Datto Parang but deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">distressing to numerous padres. The hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">part, however, for Crawson, had been to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep Parang from buying guns in small</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantities and thus preventing the accumu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation from reaching the intended amount.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But finally he convinced the datto that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was safer to take one big chance of landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the guns and ammunition at one time</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to risk a number of small shipments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus the wealth now' in hand had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the five-hundred-thousand-dollar mark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no excuse for further delay. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, Crawson did not wish to delay any</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer. The time had come to gather the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruit of his labor and his planning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little box had been brought out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this particular occasion to put into it more</seg><seg type="columnLine">gems--the result of the last raid. Craw-son</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew from his pocket a small leather bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">•and poured its contents into the box.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parang closed and locked it, rose and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">it into an adjoining room--his owti sleeping-</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crawson wished that he knew the exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding-place for the box, but several subtle</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempts to find out had failed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the datto returned, Crawson looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his watch, pleaded fatigue and said he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to retire for the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a rule Crawson chose to sleep in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent even when at headquarters. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there w'as always a sleeping-apartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for him in the datto's casa, and to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night he said that he preferred a soft bed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So the datto called a slave, who lighted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large brass lamp and stood waiting to lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way to Crawson's apartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The white man rose and starLed to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">the servant; then he stopped suddenly as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had just thought of something.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah," he said, "1 must not forget my</seg><seg type="columnLine">little courtesy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened his cigaret case and studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">its contents closely for a moment. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he carefully selected a cigaret, placed it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the datlo's lips and held out a lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">match. This was a custom which Crawson</seg><seg type="columnLine">had established early in his associations</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Datto Parang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a token of my loyalty," he told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">datto on that first occasion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mohammedan had been much flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, and since that lime they had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted until the little ceremony was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he reached his room, Crawson</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to bed but not to sleep. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to sleep. Besides, his nerves were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taut, and he fought continually to suppress</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement. FinaUy he lit a cigaret. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a native production, and he threw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in disgust, found a brown paper and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some American tobacco and rolled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke. Then he settled back and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pages of a six-months-old magazine tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forget the passing of time. Nevertheless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked at his watch often, and at last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands pointed to one o'clock. He judged</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the time for his work had arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He arose, dressed in an outfit of native</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes instead of his uniform and buckled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his w^aist a belt to which hung two</seg><seg type="columnLine">large revolvers and one small kris. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt contained one hundred cartridges.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crawson made his way without a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the big room and with his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand gently tried the door to Parang's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedroom while his right hand gripped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilt of the small kris. He was not sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parang was asleep, and. in case he was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered, a pistol-shot was out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crawson found that the door w-as fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the inside. He waited breathlessly, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rescued</seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ears strained for a sound. He could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hear his watch tick off the seconds. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">minute passed; no sound came. Then he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">carefully stuck the kris through the split-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wattled door just below the wooden latch</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which fastened it on the inside. Next he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">• pressed down on the handle of the kris, thus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lifting the latch with the blade. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">door opened readily, and Crawson stepped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' A lamp was still burning. Parang was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stretched on his bed crosswise, dead for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time being, his clothes still on. Crawson's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cigaret had fulfilled its purpose. Another</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">detail of his plan had worked out as cal-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">culated. This was encouragement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The next step was to find the teak-wood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">box. He looked about the room. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">box was not in sight. The walls of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">house were split-wattled bamboo and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thatched on the outside; there was no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chance of its being hidden there. A thor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ough investigation of the furniture re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vealed nothing, and Crawson grew anxious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">That the treasure was somewhere in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">room, he was positive, for more than once he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had seen Parang carry it there. And he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knew that the datto was too well acquainted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with Moro nature to have intrusted the box</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to any one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Still, apparently, his search had already</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eliminated every possible hiding-place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">No; there was one other. Happy thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Why had it taken so long to come?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On his hands and knees Crawson began</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">going over the floor. At last he moved the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">foot-mat beside Parang's bed, and there his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">search ended. A square panel had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cut out of the floor and a sort of trap-door</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">made. Crawson raised the door, lifted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out the box and started to leave the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then he thought of the six keys. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">found them in the pocket of Parang's tunic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">OUTSIDE of the casa Crawson</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">walked to a small, shabby tent and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">_ rapped on the closed flap. A few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seconds passed, and then two husky Moros</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">emerged from the tent and saluted in soldier</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fashion, their bare, bronze shoulders glist-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ening under the full moon. These were the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white man's personal servants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Chow," ordered Crawson. "Enough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for two days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The two servants were accustomed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sudden trips started in the middle of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">night. They were used to the demand for</seg><seg type="columnLine">chow and were always prepared to produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">it quickly. Silently the two disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a few minutes returned with food for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a two days7 journey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the boats pronto," Crawson ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell in behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the beach Crawson pointed to a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">outrigger. The Moros clambered aboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took their places at the oars. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man followed, and, as he seated him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in the stern of the boat, he saw one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Moros make a slight gesture toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box. Also, he noted that tjie two were</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispering furtively to each other. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if some rumor of the box and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure had reached them. It was pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible. Yes, even probable. Secrets were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to keep. At any rate, it was plain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his servants were suspicious, and Crawson</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided that the sooner he asserted himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">the better. He whipped out one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolvers and said curtly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm leaving this-country of yours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you two may as well know it now as any</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Shove off, and the first one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes a sound is meat for the sharks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For half an hour the men rowed vigor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously under the stimulus of the white man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun. Then he ordered a halt and called</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them over to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take off that bolo," he said, "and throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">it into the sea. Now, have you got any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more knives stored away about you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, senor," answered the Moro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turn your back," said Crawson, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll soon find out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the man's back was turned, Craw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son pressed the muzzle of his revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the brown neck just below the ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with his left hand felt around the waist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of the fellow's breech-clout and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought out a wavey little double-edged</seg><seg type="columnLine">kris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought so," said the white man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw the thing overboard after its larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, go back and take your place at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oar," he ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the first servant was seated, Craw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son called the other one over and searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," said Crawson, "if I turn my back</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the fifth part of a second, you hombres</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't be able to whiz a knife into me. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't forget to put some muscle behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them oars. If you do, I might get careless</seg><seg type="columnLine">with these six-shooters."</seg><seg type="columnLine">IOO</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that he settled back to guard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men who were sending the boat north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward with long, sweeping strokes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a trip of about one hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety miJes that Crawson was intending</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make, and he figured that he could force</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two Moros to row that distance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy-two hours. He had planned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">run north from Tawi Tawi until he passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zamboanga City, which is at the southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the Zamboanga Peninsula.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he proposed to change his course</seg><seg type="columnLine">east and pick up the coast of Mindanao off</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Ramon, which is about twenty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">north of Zamboanga City. Here he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">land among the peaceable Subanos, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no Moros and where he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonably sure there would be no troops.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could not afford to meet any soldiers--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">any white people at all, for that matter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not know just how much the author-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ities knew about his raids in Mindanao or</seg><seg type="columnLine">just how badly he might be wanted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After landing he intended to go into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle near San Ramon, tie the Moros hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and foot and hold them prisoners. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the jungle he would remain until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could learn of some steamer that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailing from Zamboanga to Australia.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he would turn his prisoners loose at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last minute, slip down in the night and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get aboard the ship. And the new life</seg><seg type="columnLine">would begin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a clear night. The moon silvered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smooth, green water, and the arms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outrigger hissed as they skimmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly along the surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With his gun in his right hand and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiller in his left, Crawson held his boat to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north. Far astern of him, low in the sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung the Southern Cross, symbolic of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropics, of adventure. At his feet lay five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred thousand dollars--not in humdrum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">commonplace money but in clean, pulse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirring jewels. The blood coursed hotly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his veins. He felt the thrill of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawlessness--of piracy. He had defied all</seg><seg type="columnLine">conventions, alJ law. He liad set aside all</seg><seg type="columnLine">scruples and taken for himself what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted out of the wealth of the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now he rode, a very monarch on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad sea, forcing by sheer power two hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man beings to do his absolute will. Thus in</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhilaration of possession, Crawson coaxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and threatened and drove the Moros on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater effort. He knew that daylight</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bring discovery and that the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sea would then be searched in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The precious hours from 2:30--the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Crawson left the beach--till daylight</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped id1 too swiftly. When day dawned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two Moros were extremely tired, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crawson's direst threats, accompanied by</seg><seg type="columnLine">an occasional blow, failed to speed up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swing of their oars. To make the prospect</seg><seg type="columnLine">less rosy, black clouds were gathering in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens and the wind was steadily increas-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. About eleven o'clock in the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crawson saw two outriggers rise on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crest of a long sw-ell well astern of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were at least a dozen men in each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boats. Crawson had expected to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursued, but he hardly thought they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have overtaken him so soon. At first he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inclined to doubt that they were pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suers. But any question as to who they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were was promptly settled by a puff of</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'hite smoke which rose from one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oncoming boats and a Mauser bullet which</seg><seg type="columnLine">came whining across the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crawson knew that it was no miracle</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Moros should have picked up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">course so easily. Had he gone in any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, they would have sighted him just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as quickly. For these were only two of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen boats sent out in fan-shape formation</seg><seg type="columnLine">so as to cover the entire surface for miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. The wrhite man now prayed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storm which he had so recently dreaded;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would at least put an end to the firing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps give him a chance to elude the</seg><seg type="columnLine">A loros.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pursuers wrere pulling nowr with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">their might, and with the strength of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">many oars they were gaining fast. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed but a question of time until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">erstwhile general would be overhauled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken prisoner or else shot by his own sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diers. Crawson realized that he must do</seg><seg type="columnLine">some tiling--that in some wav he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive the two men in his owti boat on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater effort. He fired two shots in quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">succession into the gunwales of the boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one shot at the elbow of each of the Moros.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pull!" he shouted. "Pull! Or the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">will lodge in your hides."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE terror of the shots and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierceness of Crawson's voice sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear to their hearts; they forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fatigue, leaned far forward and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent their oars with long backward sweeps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boat shot out with doubled speed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rescued</seg><seg type="columnLine">IOI</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pursuers ceased to gain for a short time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the exertion that Crawson's men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been driven to was short-lived; it was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond their powers to keep it up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime the waves were rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising, for the wind, which had been blowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">briskly from the northwest, suddenly shifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the southwest with increased force.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now, instead of being compelled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull partly against the wind, Crawson had</seg><seg type="columnLine">both wind and water at his back driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">him along his proper course faster than</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty oars could have done. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same wind which drove his boat up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watery mountains and down across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seething valleys did the same for his pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suers. Nevertheless, Crawson welcomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storm, which by now had turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky to a black shroud and the sea to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring, tearing monster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time the two oarsmen had let</seg><seg type="columnLine">their oars go and turned all their attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the business of staying in the boat. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little box was bouncing around in a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was alarming. Crawson sheathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his revolver--there was no danger from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">servants just then--and knelt astride the til-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler, thus holding the boat on its course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he felt under the seat and found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short coil of rope. This he ran through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron handles of the box and bound it to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Often now, as the frail craft scurried up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the. green wall of some gigantic billow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crawson felt sure that it would pitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward, bottom up, and be crushed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great rolling mass of water immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind. Still the boat continued to climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the sheer, green banks, its arms out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread like some monstrous spider, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crawson would lean to the bottom lest he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall out backward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, when the little shell would shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a curving ridge and cling there for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathless second, Crawson was transported</seg><seg type="columnLine">to raptures. In those few brief moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would live ages at the pinnacle of life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet again, as the stinging salt spray</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped his face and the boat raced down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a speed which no engine could propel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the combing crests of the waves lapped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him like hungry tongues, Crawson</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted in joy and defiance at the wild,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling elements about him. But through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all he never forgot to use his tiller. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he kept the stern of his boat to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind--kept it from turning broadside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">being swamped. It was a glorious battle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pigmy man outwitting and overriding</seg><seg type="columnLine">limitless power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So filled was Crawson's mind with sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sations that he had forgotten he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone until reminded by the sight of his two</seg><seg type="columnLine">servants diving overboard. He realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that only some imminent danger could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven them to leave the boat and brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a boiling tumult. So he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanning the horizon as closely as possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble for an explanation of this sudden rash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First he eyed the boat up and down for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leak, but there was none. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">water in the bottom to speak of--merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had splashed aboard in the form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spray \ the little craft was riding the waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">buoy antly. At that instant the boat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the crest of a towering billow, and Craw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son was in a position to see much of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watery^ space about him, but the two ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vants were not in sight. Doubtless they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been carried down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the elevation of its position the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little craft dived to the seemingly bottom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less depth of a watery chasm. Then on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crest of the next wave Crawson learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">why his oarsmen had chosen to go over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board. Scarcely had he seen it when his</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, rushing down the opposite side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great wave with a scud-driving speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed upon the reef and shattered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">splinters. The Moros had feared this</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than the raging water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a swirl of water about Craw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's ears, an impression of tangled rafts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of kindling wood, and then he found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to the reef, although the sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">coral cut his hands terribly. Instinctively',</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-consciously, he freed one hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached up to his shoulder. The box was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still there, intact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking conditions as they were, the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of most and immediate importance was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find some sort of shelter from the tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous weight of onrushing water. Unless he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did this, Crawson knew that he would soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">be beaten insensible. He dragged himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and crawled slowly over the reef,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding grimly with hands and feet to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">irregular surface to brace his body against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ever-surging water. Thus he worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way slowly and painfully to the western</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the reef. Once there, he crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the rough side and found a ledge that</seg><seg type="columnLine">afforded him a foothold. The ledge was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                                                                              1</seg><seg type="columnLine">102	Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">several feet below the surface. And, stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on this with more than half of his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">under water and clinging to the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reef with both hands, he was partially pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected from the storm-driven water which</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke and spent most of its force on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crawson remained clinging here for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to him an unendurable length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. His shoulders ached from the weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the box, which had become to him not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of pounds but of tons. His fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were cramped and bleeding from holding to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ledge, and he felt that he had been hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on there since the first ray of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn. But in reality it was less than an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, for the storm broke quickly, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">so often do in tropical waters. The clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">melted, and the siui shone forth, dazzling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">searing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as the commotion of the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to subside, Crawson left his perch</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ledge and drew himself up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the reef. The seas were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">running high, but the force was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them. Crawson was able to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and survey his surroundings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">H ALMOST the first thing he saw was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a 1owt, flat speck of land. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere dot on the face of Lhe ocean.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could see across it. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants, no growth--just a bare, bald</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand-dune with a rocky formation at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, completely surrounded by a coral</seg><seg type="columnLine">reef. Yet to Crawson it was a paradise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an oasis in the desert. He judged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island to be about a mile from the reef, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even in his present condition he felt equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a swim of that distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The seas were fast getting down to nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal. Crawson scanned the horizon in</seg><seg type="columnLine">search of the Moros. They were not to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. The white man was glad for this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He might be able to swim a mile, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in no shape for an encounter with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang of Moros. Moreover, he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon except his two hands with which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">defend himself. When his boat had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecked, his belt was torn off in some way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with it went his dagger, his revolvers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ammunition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crawson sat down and took off his shoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trousers, Lied the shoes together and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung them over his neck, stuffed the trousers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in between his back and the jewel box,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped into the water and struck out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island with a long, steady stroke that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew- he would be able to maintain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as he reached the island, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he judged to be about five miles in circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference, Crawson began going over it in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope of finding fresh water. But, much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dismay, there was not a drop to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found. But he did come upon numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds. Some of the more timid ones flew a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little away at his approach, but most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them merely waddled to one side as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came near. He recognized them for gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nies and terns, and by the great quantities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of eggs strewn on the sand he knew they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were there for the purpose of breeding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This, then, solved the problem of food.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, Crawson's thirst was greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than his hunger just then; so he determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look again for water before trying Lhe</seg><seg type="columnLine">eggs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While pursuing his search for water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crawson discovered the hull of an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck, a small sailing craft. It was piled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the beach and half buried in the sand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicating that it had been wrecked years</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. He ripped an oaken plank from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the old hull, broke it at a convenient</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, w'ent back about two hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the beach and began to dig. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected that he would have to try in many</seg><seg type="columnLine">places, but to his surprize water began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubble up through the sand when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dug down less than five feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crawson cupped his hands and tasted it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was cool and fresh--not the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinge of salt. He thought it a miracle that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had struck water al the first place he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried. Later he w'as to learn that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike water anywhere on the island as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he dug down to the level of the ocean's</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface. It was merely the ocean water</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seeped through the sand and was fil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered in the process.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Crawson had slaked his thirst at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little well of his own making, his incen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive for further exertion was removed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the present, at least, his hunger was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten in the crying need of his body--</seg><seg type="columnLine">his entire body from molecule to muscle--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for relaxation, rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ancient schooner had come on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach at the north side of the island with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose pointing southward. Therefore, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time was afternoon, the western side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it offered a small space of shade. Crawson</seg><seg type="columnLine">strelched out in the coolness of this spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave himself up to slumber--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rescued</seg><seg type="columnLine">103</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumber which is absolute oblivion the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblivion that comes to the utterly ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crawson was aroused some hours later</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the lapping of cool water about his body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The waves had actually reached the height</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his neck. It was high tide. He crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the thin sheet of rising and receding</seg><seg type="columnLine">water and stood up, once more fresh, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigorated, hungry, ready for the eggs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He scooped out a slight depression in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand, placed in it half a dozen eggs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered them with more sand. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripped a plank from the old wreck and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heavy chunk of coral broke it into fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">splinters and piled them over the eggs</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to fire. But, when he drew' from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket a supposedly w'aterproof match-box,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found that his matches were totally</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolved by water. However, this did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">daunt Crawson, nor did he mean that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would eat his eggs raw. He looked around</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a w'hile and found some dry grass, a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrawny turfs of which grew on the island.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took some of the grass between his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and ground it into fine chaff. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the chaff he held two stones and struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">them together. A spark fell; the chaff</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignited. This he set to the splinters, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon the eggs were roasted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Crawson finished eating, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about an hour before sunset, and the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">was exceptionally clear. Looking off to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">east, in the hazy distance he could distin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guish the dim shape of a great mountain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This, he knew, was on the Island of Jolo;</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other island so near lifted its peak to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that height. And by his proximity to Jolo</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crawson knew that he was marooned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the many nameless, uncharted islands</seg><seg type="columnLine">that are a part of the Sulu Archipelago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the west of him he could see another</seg><seg type="columnLine">island, which was, apparently, about five</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles away. This island was larger and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a much greater elevation than the one on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he was located. Also, it appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a considerable growth of coco-palms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These trees interested Crawson a great deal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he could only get to the other island, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find some way of making these tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight spires into a raft. He knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships never came into that labyrinth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coral reefs; so his one hope of getting to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainland was a raft of some sort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first Crawson had thought to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struct a raft out of timber from the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck, but half an hour's consideration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this project proved it impractical. Any</seg><seg type="columnLine">raft that he could rig out with boards and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross-beams would be too light and too frail</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a hundred-mile sea voyage. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other hand, a raft of heavy logs would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be so easily capsized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Crawson sat thinking these things</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, twilight effaced the gold of the sunset;</seg><seg type="columnLine">a myriad stars dotted the sky; cold, pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonbeams fell like shattered lances on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark bosom of the ocean; a mating bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">called sleepily to its loved one, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound blended and harmonized with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull boom of the waves on the distant reef.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then at last the castaway, lulled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balmy, salt air, threw aside his problems</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crawson spent the next morning working</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof off the galley of the old hull. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had nothing but a chunk of coral and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of cross-beam to work with, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a tedious job. But he finally pried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing off in good condition. It made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flimsy raft, one that he would never dare the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea with, but he thought he could get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other island on it. However, he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided not to make the trip for several days</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come. If there were any Moros--his</seg><seg type="columnLine">late pursuers--marooned over there, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would probably rig up a raft and either</seg><seg type="columnLine">start for Tawi Tawi or come looking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in the next day or two.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS noon when Crawson com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted his task with the galley roof,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was again hungry. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">roasted more eggs and w^as much annoyed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find, upon peeling the shells off, that two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were exceedingly strong and that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">had in it a half-hatched bird. He was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready beginning to feel the w-ant of variety</seg><seg type="columnLine">in food, and the sight of a half-hatched bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his dinner did not increase his relish for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straight egg diet. Crawson determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it should not happen again. He found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piece of board, the one he had used to dig</seg><seg type="columnLine">the well, and with it drew' a large circle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sand and moved every egg out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle. He knew then that the eggs he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find in this circle for the next few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days would be fresh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three days passed. No Moros showed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Crawson decided that he wTould risk a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip to the other island. He buried his box</seg><seg type="columnLine">of jewels deep under the lee of the old hulL</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the Moros were on the other island, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no intention of carrying the treasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to them. Then, when the tide came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and washed away all traces of his digging, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled his clothes into a small bundle, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">them secure on the raft, took a board of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venient length and rowed out to a gap in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reef, worked his raft through and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">on liis perilous voyage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had not gone far before he noticed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single sharp fin about two inches above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Crawson did not need to look to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what was beneath the fin; it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, gray cigar-shaped thing--a man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eater--slinking along with ghoulish stealth</seg><seg type="columnLine">just across from the little raft. Crawson</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapped the water loudly with the llat of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddle, and for a few minutes the fin disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared. But soon it was back again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slinking along even closer than before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And so the man rowed on, and so the silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray ghoul dogged his course. That the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shark might attack Crawson on his flimsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">raft was not altogether improbable, and, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did, the result was certain--the raft</seg><seg type="columnLine">upset, a flash of red jaws, of gleaming teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and--the end. But this ever present pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility did not greatly worry Crawson;</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather, it made the situation interesting--</seg><seg type="columnLine">added zest to existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After about three hours the raft crossed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly submerged reef, and the shark disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared. A little more and Crawson landed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few minutes proved that there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moros on the island. It was not a sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation like the island he had just left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but one of those humps of earth that have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been pushed up above water surface by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some subterianean upheaval. Having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised from the bed of the ocean, the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fertile and its foliage rank. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coconuts and bananas and nipa in</seg><seg type="columnLine">abundance. Also, Crawson found a spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">of clear, fresh water bubbling through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crevice in the side of a rock-walled cliff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After allowing himself the luxury of half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen bananas and the milk from two half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown coconuts, he set about the work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructing a raft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First he gathered nipa and plaited it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">ihree-ply strands of about forty feet each.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These he tied from tree to tree, stretching</seg><seg type="columnLine">them tight and leaving them to dry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bundle alter bundle he plaited, and strand</seg><seg type="columnLine">after strand he stretched among the trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">till he had more than twelve hundred feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nipa rope. This work occupied the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of ten days, and, when it was finished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his next item was logs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crawson had no tool to cut down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trim trees; so he searched out fallen logs--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not rotten ones, but sound ones blown down</seg><seg type="columnLine">by typhoons Naturally, these logs were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">various lengths, and, tt/get them all of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, he rolled and dragged them to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, side by side, the butt ends even.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he brought dry grass and branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and built a fire across the logs where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bum them off evenly and at a proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">length. Then, laying them in two tiers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crosswise, and using the grass rope for</seg><seg type="columnLine">laslung, he soon completed a much-roped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fairly durable raft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of some small boughs and vines Craw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son constructed a sort of bin at the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of tlie raft, and this he filled with coco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nuts, the milk of which would take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of water on the voyage. Building</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raft had taken altogether fifteen day's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and during that time Crawson had eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but coconuts and bananas. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was glad to set out for the sand island</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, where he could eat eggs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crawson started about ten o'clock in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, but his raft was heavy, broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended and consequently hard to row. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all day covering the five or six miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the Islands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shortly before sundown he made his raft</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast to the old wreck and immediately began</seg><seg type="columnLine">digging to see whether his treasure was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe. He had spent some anxious nights</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that, but now he found it just as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left it. So he roasted himself a meal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eggs and then placed several dozen more</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a large fire and left them to roast</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the night. These were for th*</seg><seg type="columnLine">voyage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next morning Crawson started</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his voyage to the small coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">town of San Ramon. For eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">days Crawson rowed diligently, stopping to</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatch a few hours of sleep only when</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature became too insistent to be denied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The end of the eighth day found him in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad way, indeed. For three days he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not seen sun, moon or stars. He had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely lost all idea of direction. Day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, hour and minute, he dwelt on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">probability of his location. Where was he?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was he going toward San Ramon or out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea? These questions reiterated them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves again and again. They preyed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nerves. Panic seized him. His muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stiff and sore from rowing and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Day-Dreams</seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands blistered. His mind was on the verge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolution. Then, at last, nature came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his relief, and Crawson slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a whistle, shrill, metallic. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed faintly to pierce dim, invisible walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherein Crawson was confined. The whistle</seg><seg type="columnLine">died out, but the walls had been pierced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There came the clang of bells. Crawson had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard bells like that before. Where? Oh, yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be sure--in the engine-room on a ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's where he had heard those bells.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were signals to the engineer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The invisible walls around Crawson were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered. He now heard clearly. A voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of authority was giving commands. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">where was he, Crawson? Where had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from? How had he come to be here</seg><seg type="columnLine">so close to a ship and yet not on the ship?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He opened his eyes. A long blade of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">slanted down on him and revealed his raft</seg><seg type="columnLine">of logs, coconuts piled at one end and water</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about. Ah, yes, he knew then. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been lost at sea on a raft. He had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep, and this was a ship come to rescue</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. At last he would get off of the raft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feel the comfort and certainty of know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing where he was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The life-boat was alongside of his raft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crawson's jewel box, as usual, was roped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders. He scrambled to his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knees and crawled stiffly to the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raft. He was weak, exhausted. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors helped him gently into their boat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then aboard the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hours later Crawson awoke in a bunk in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forecastle. He moved, and there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clank of chains. His wrists and his ankles</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in irons. Crawson held up his man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acled hands and demanded of the sailor</seg><seg type="columnLine">across from him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "WTiat the-does this mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It means that the skipper's had a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">into that little teak-wood box," responded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sailor, ''and he's decided that you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crawson, the fellow who's been leadin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moros and lootin' down around Zambo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anga."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What right has this skipper got to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosing into my belongings?" snarled Craw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, son," grinned the other. "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard of a United States revenue cutter."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crawson turned his back to the sailor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing more to be said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">DAY-DREAM S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          BY £.

The man called</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lonesome" sat on a soap box with his lees</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed and with his forearms resting on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper knee. He was a tall and rangey</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man, as hard as hickory and as lithe</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a panther and remarkably taciturn at</seg><seg type="columnLine">times--which, of course, had bred for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nickname.

He was at least thirty-five,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ten years older than Bentley. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">theirs had been a wonderfully tight friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship for all of that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lonesome did not favor Ashford with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply.

Ashford laughed outright at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which he was pleased to think of as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other's discomfiture. Just then there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the ears of those in the commissary</seg><seg type="columnLine">a snatch of a foolish old song in the ringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of Howling Jim, who was leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarding-house for the big stove.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm a-goin' to live, anyhow, till I die--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyhow, anyhow, till I die!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Howlin's a-comin!," grinned Ashford.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I reckon ye'll behave yerself now, Lone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bentley stuck fast to his motto, "When</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye ain't got nothin' to say, say it," and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howling Jim's Pal</seg><seg type="columnLine">107</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent.

He found an</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty box close to Lonesome and sat down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another minute and the commissary door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened again. This time a slender and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nicely-figured girl of not much more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty' came in. Snow particles glistened</seg><seg type="columnLine">like diamond chips on her pale-blue home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knit and tasseled headgear and on her cheap</seg><seg type="columnLine">but warm imitation Paisley shawl. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks were as rosy as red apples from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold air and good health, and her long brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were full of laughter twinkles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smiling for no reason whatever, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked across to the counter. She paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the slightest notice to the score of log-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers, who had fallen as still as death at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of her and who now watched her as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she were the very last woman in the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those big, rugged men adored Nancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirkland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dad ain't got any tob'accy," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawled softly to Billy Allison, the clerk, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale youth who hailed from the lowland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Allison gave her a tin of smoking tobacco.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She put a little silver coin on the counter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned for the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lonesome Bentley^'s gaze had been fast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened sternly and defiantly upon Gideon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ashford's dark countenance from the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the girl's coming. Asliford now</seg><seg type="columnLine">put his hands on his knees and was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go to his feet. Bentley tapped him</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply on the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Set still," said Lonesome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Set still!" Lonesome snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ashford stared in amazement at having</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand thus called. Then his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I got as good a right to go home with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her as you have."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, you ain't!" Bentley's low, steely</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice cut him off. "You ain't fit!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl was gone. Ashford rose, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his huge and hairy hands curled up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists. Bentley slipped to his feet without</seg><seg type="columnLine">any apparent effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You ain't fit," he reiterated. "Any</seg><seg type="columnLine">man what lies and steals and drinks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambles ain't fit to go with any decent</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman anywhere. I've shore said it. Ef</seg><seg type="columnLine">you want to fight me about it, go to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've took all o' yore fim-makin' and mouth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' I'll ever take.

His eyes fairly sparkled. He held</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself as tense as a coiled steel spring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bully turned red and glanced with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickly grin toward the men who watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waited at Bentley^s elbows. Ashford</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that he had to fight or else let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outfit take it for granted that he was afraid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that steel spring of a man who stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him dared him to so much as lift a</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment there was charged silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was broken by a silly little guffaw from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lowland youth who held forth as com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">missary clerk, and with that all the loggers</seg><seg type="columnLine">except the two belligerents themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined in a roar of derisive laughter. Gid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ashford, the fallen false god, became still</seg><seg type="columnLine">redder. He slumped back to his box, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper and tobacco from his pocket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously began to roll for himself a cigaret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now that the thing was over, Howling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Baskin turned and placed a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">proudly on his pal's shoulder. To the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize of everybody, Lonesome Bentley</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw Howling Jim's hand off angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind," said Lonesome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baskin stared, looked hurt, stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly to the counter and leaned against</seg><seg type="columnLine">it rather heavily. Bentley gave the crest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen erstwhile bully a look of contempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">io8</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went alone toward the boarding-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not long afterward the commissary crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to thin out. At closing time only</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ashford and Billy Allison, the clerk, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. And Ashford watched young Allison</seg><seg type="columnLine">keenly as he took the day's gleanings from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money-drawer and placed them in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small iron safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Morgan-Ilaley Company's commis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary banked but once each month, and these</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposits ran anywhere from four to eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred dollars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HWHEN Lonesome Bentley went</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the boarding-house, Howling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim followed him. Bentley did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even look around until he had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the up-stairs sleeping-quarters of the crew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which a big hanging oil lamp burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly. He gave Baskin a glance that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">part scowl, undressed without a word to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">former great crony and crept silently under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his blankets. Baskin followed suit, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for five minutes the two big man lay so still</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in their narrow beds, within six feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each other, that they seemed to be hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Howling Jim put the soft pedal on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fog-horn voice and spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Lonesome!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lonesome," Baskin pursued, "what is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's come between you and me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind," Bentley said sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And not another word could Howling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim get out of him that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Howling Jim found slumber forsaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. As for Lonesome, neither did he go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sleep readily. His thoughts wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">let him sleep. Those thoughts would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been highly enlightening to Baskin if only</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could have read them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A week before Lonesome Bentley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Nathan Kirkland's daughter, who lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her parents in a big hewn-log cabin a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile down Big Brother Creek, had quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reled bitterly--so bitterly, in fact, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nancy had snapped off her engagement</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Bentley as if it had been of no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance than a pie-crust! Lonesome</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know what they had quarreled about</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Nancy didn't remember. That is how it</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes when young human beings set other</seg><seg type="columnLine">young human beings up on pedestals as</seg><seg type="columnLine">models of perfection to worship them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fault was humanity's, rather than either</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nancy Kirkland's or Lonesome Bentley's</seg><seg type="columnLine">individually, no doubt. And then-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four days after the misunderstanding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a bright Sunday afternoon, Bentley had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided that he would try to bridge the</seg><seg type="columnLine">abyss that yawned between him and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetheart by going to her and confessing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had been a fool. He had started for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her home, and by the merest chance he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come upon a scene that distressed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorely. Nancy and Howling Jim were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting together under a big poplar; Baskin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was holding her hand in his, and she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling at him in her very best way!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Lonesome Bentley had stolen back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp with red-hot iron in his soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed doubly hard to bear, following,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it did, on the heels of news to the effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Morgan-Haley Company looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him--Lonesome Bentley, as the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">best logger in the outfit. Bentley, for all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his taciturni ty, was an ambitious young man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOUGH they had lost some sleep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bentley and Baskin sprang from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their beds at the first ringing blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the railroad iron triangle-gong which</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung just outside the kitchen door. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">had anything to say. Lonesome was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to get his clothing on. He snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his hat and hastened down to the dimly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted back porch to bathe his face and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had no more than finished his washing</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Howling Jim addressed him from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open doorway behind him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The super wants to see ye. Lonesome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In his office. Said for me to tell ye. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">grab! That's good luck, Lonesome!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a fine bid for talk; however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lonesome failed to nibble. Without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single word Bentley threw the icy-cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">towel to its peg on the wall and went toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Superintendent Bradshaw's little office on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first floor. He wondered just what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the good luck was. A raise in wages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The high light of the Morgan-Haley</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp was a big and bronzed elderly man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he now sat before a small sheet-iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">stove, which w'as glowing hot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down, Bentley," he said, pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward a cheap straight-back. Lonesome</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped into the chair, and Bradshaw went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on: "Nobody knows loggin' better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know it, Bentley, and I've recom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mended you for the super's job here. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howling Jim's Pal</seg><seg type="columnLine">109</seg><seg type="columnLine">leavin' in just fifteen more days. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you think of it? Can you hold it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "1 can read and write and figger enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep the time-sheets," Lonesome said</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly, more to him self than to Bradshaw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps. "Shore, I can hold it. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">much obliged to ye, Brad!''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Honest appreciation beamed from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. To be the superintendent of a log-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging outfit, that was his fondest dream but</seg><seg type="columnLine">one--and that one concerned Nancy Kirk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, himself and a preacher! He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked hard and for years in the attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fit himself for a superintendent's place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bradshaw was about to speak again when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door banged open to admit a miniature</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurricane of cold air and the youthful</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of Billy Allison, the commissary</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk. Allison snapped the door shut be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him and turned nervously to the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The commissary's front door was broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">open last night, Brad," he announced in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">low and somewhat shaky voice. "Whoever</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was used a peavy spike which was left</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying in the snow by the step. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe is all right, and I didn't notice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything was gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bradshaw rose, and so did Bentley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the superintendent beckoned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">logger, and the three of them went toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the company's general store. Dawn was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just spreading its great, rose-colored fan</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward from the crest of Little Brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountain; the new day promised to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear and bright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AJlison had already lighted the great oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp that hung in the cenLer of the big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">long room, and he and the other two quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked over the stock. So far as they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to see, nothing had been stolen. Brad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaw walked back to the safe, which stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the rear end of the counter; it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly locked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Sure this is all right, Billy?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I haven't looked inside," frowned young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hastened to the safe, knelt before it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and within another minute swung open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron door. Then he shot to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all gone--six hundred dollars!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had spoken correctly. The six hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred dollars in cash was not there. Bentley</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed forward and leaned over the counter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Funny how that happened," was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawling, puzzled comment. "It must ha'</seg><seg type="columnLine">been somebody that knowed the combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Billy Allison flashed a quick look toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hillman, as at an accuser. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">second and he was staring anxiously into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the superintendent's bronzed face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Brad, do you think--" he began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bradshaw interrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The lad didn't do it, Lonesome," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said a trifle sharply. "And I didn't do it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only us two and Stapleton Haley knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">the combination. There's been a smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">job pulled off here, Lonesome. We'd better</seg><seg type="columnLine">send to Jones ville for the sheriff as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible. But first maybe we'd better see</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether there's any footprints leadin' off</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the commissary. Eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bentley nodded, and Allison said eagerly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes; the snow had stopped falling when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I closed last night, and the robber couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone anywhere except to the boarding-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house without his footprints giving him</seg><seg type="columnLine">away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was now light enough for them to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the track of a rabbit in the snow out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. They walked a wide circle in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing, encompassing both the commissary</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the boarding-house without coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a single footprint that couldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily accounted for. Which was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusive proof that both the thief and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money were still in camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they had come to the commissary's</seg><seg type="columnLine">front doorway again, Bradshaw turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bentley with this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of the loggin'-engines ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have some fire in it from yesterday, Lone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some. Sneak over to the tracks and take</seg><seg type="columnLine">one dawn to Jones ville and bring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff. It's down-grade nearly all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and you can raise steam as you go.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bentley ran to the tracks, leaped aboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the geared locomotives and loosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brakes. The wheels began to turn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The passing of an hour found him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot-hills with a fair head of steam coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. Two hours after sunrise he was speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hastily with Garrett Henry, the lanky</seg><seg type="columnLine">and serious, blue-clad and broad-hatted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jonesville sheriff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS not far from noontime</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the thundering staccato of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small, geared engine's laboring</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhaust reached the ears of those who waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Morgan-Hale}' camp on Big Brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creek. The crew had not gone to work in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woods that day. When at last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little locomotive came to a halt in the camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing, Garrett Henry and Bentley leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the snowy ground and went to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Superintendent Bradshaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Find out anything more?" growled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bradshaw shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the thief is still here, and the money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. You've got a chance to show us how</seg><seg type="columnLine">smart you are, all right I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henry merely grunted. The trio walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on and entered the commissary, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">half filled with expectant timberjacks. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">accommodating logger passed to the sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peavy that had been used in breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the door. Henry looked it over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that it was only an ordinary implement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its kind and put it down. Then he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the superintendent and Bentley went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the safe, where the officer asked questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">soberly, nodded a great deal and made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">superficial examination. Howling Jim Bas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kin had followed them; he idly dropped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly hand to Lonesome Bentley's arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Bentley threw it off as if it were a tiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unspeakable contamination!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Somebody who knowed the combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion," decided Henry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was not," firmly replied Bradshaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He himself had vouched for the honesty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Billy Allison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff began to strike matches that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might better see into dark corners about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safe. Suddenly he bent lower and</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up a small, square object that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mostly white. As he straightened to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">it into better light--Henry's eyes had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so good as his courage--a muscular</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm in corduroy shot over his shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized it, and, before the passing of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, the man to whom that arm belonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">was running like a race-horse for the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it was Howling Jim, who had, by chance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">been standing directly behind the officer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry snatched his revolver from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster and called upon Baskin to halt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Half a dozen loggers stepped out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path of a possible bullet. But Howling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim didn't stop; he drove through the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, turned sharply to his left and out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff's range of vision and made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the near-by woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henry followed rapidly to the door-sill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Lonesome Bentley was within a yard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him when he reached it. Then Garrett</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry leveled his revolver at the fleeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure. Baskin was running unwisely in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight line, his brown-clad body making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain and almost stationary target against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead white of the snow. But before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry could fire, Bentley caught his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and pulled him backward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not that!" growled Lonesome, ashen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced and defiant. "You don't kill Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baskin as easy as that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Henry recovered himself, Baskin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the laurels and his escape assured.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The officer now turned his attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bentley, and there was a queer smile about</seg><seg type="columnLine">liis lips. *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pals, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mighty good pals--" began Lonesome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembering Nancy' Kirkland and breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">off short.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the fractional part of a minute he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked away at nothing, and, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">again turned his eyes toward the JonesviJle</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff, he found himself staring straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the muzzle of a Colt .45.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's my duty to arrest you," quietly said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garrett Henry, "as a pardner in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbery'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lonesome Bentley' lived a long time in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment that followed tin's announcement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In his mind?s eye he saw himself and Nancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">--when he had asked her--when she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed to marry' him. He saw himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nancy when they had quarreled over--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't remember what. And he saw Howl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Jim, his pal, holding the girl's hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">while she smiled her best smile into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rugged face. All of it--his bright hopes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a superin tendency, the robbery, the accusa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and all the rest of it--somehow tangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, muddled him. dazed him. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">unreal, like a bad dream. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff was speaking again--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll have to search you, Bentley."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lonesome gave no sign that he had heard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As Henry began to go through the pockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his prisoner, Nancy Kirkland walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">smilingly into the commissary and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Billy Allison, who now stood in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">place behind the counter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want some sug-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was as far as she ever got with it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for at that instant she caught sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff and Lonesome Bentley. She .went</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately toward them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What--what's that for?" she demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a small, thin voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howling Jim's Pal</seg><seg type="columnLine">111</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nobody answered. The officer went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his slow and exceedingly careful search</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bentley's clothing. Lonesome looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward her, smiled a tiny smile that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate rather than merry and turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze aside. Gideon Ashford, wrho had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the entire proceedings with tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umph written largely over his dark coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenance, touched Nancy Kirkland's arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whispered--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'll tell ye ef nobody else won't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With several backward glances toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">BentJey the girl went with Ashford to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow-covered ground outside. There Ash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford blew sparks from his home-made</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigaret and bent forward with this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lonesome was cuniinger'n I thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was," in low tones. "He was cunning</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to open the commissary safe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take out the six hundred dollars the' was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and leave it locked up jest like it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afore! It's shore a joke on him--he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brung the sheriff out and 'en got ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested hisself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He never done the robbin'!" flared</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nancy, her brown eyes wide and sparkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with resentment. "He wouldn't never do</seg><seg type="columnLine">it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ashford shrugged his ox-like shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Forchunitly or onforchunitly, ye don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">haf to take my word for it. Look here!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the open door he had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garrett Henry unhook a safety-pin from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper edge of one of Bentley's inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat pockets and take out a sizeable roll of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank-notes! Ashford stepped hastily back</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the door-sill, and Nancy Kirkland</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed with a lump in her throat. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">one eye still on his prisoner Henry counted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money through, after which he said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bentley:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Six hundred, I believe you told me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here's two hundred and ten. You didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite get your share, did you, Lonesome?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bentley was still ashen-faced, still defiant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He straightened even a little more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You mean that me and Howlin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mean that you and Howlin' Jim wrent</seg><seg type="columnLine">pardners in the deal," hazarded the sheriff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Better confess, Lonesome. It'll go easier</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you, you know. Now just how did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and Howlin' manage to get the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">without workin' the combination?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Charmed it-out," drawled Bentley in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">keenest sarcasm. He brought his' hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the lapels of his corduroy coat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a forefinger rubbed his chin as if re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flectively. "One of us stood on each side o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safe. How'lin' would say, 'Keeno,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presto,' and I'd say, 'Pr«sto, Keeno.' And</seg><seg type="columnLine">purty soon the money jest tumbled right</seg><seg type="columnLine">out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lonesome interrupted himself with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">master play. He brought his two hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward and in one lightning-like move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment drove Garrett Henry's revolver fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet out of his grip and seized the roll of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and ten dollars in bank-notes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That money represented Bentley's savings</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a year. Henry sprang to recover his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon, and Lonesome sprang for the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. As the sheriff ran toward the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his revolver in his hand, a peavy came</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtling before his legs, tripping him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">causing him to fall heavily. When he rose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bentley was in the laurels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing that Lonesome, too, had escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, the fuming sheriff turned back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped squarely before Nancy Kirkland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You, too!" he exclaimed. "You throwed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peavy, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shore did," Nancy admitted. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't any secret. What're ye a-goin' to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henry's countenance was threatening--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, considering that morning's run of</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck for him, one may hardly blame him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll arrest you as a--a accomplice; that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I'm a-goin' to do about it!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then that the camp rose and spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a single man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'll be danged ef ye do!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hemy faced the loggers--loggers who</seg><seg type="columnLine">adored Nathan Kirkland's daughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be danged ef ye do!" the camp spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet again, and it came a little more deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minedly than before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR the first hundred yards after he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gained the snowy underbrush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">_Bentley's thoughts wrere occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly with making good his escape. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of his people had ever been to jail, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wasn't going so long as he could avoid it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, seeing that he was in no immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger of capture--the average down-South</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff knows the hopelessness of chasing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountaineer in the laurels--Bentley began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wonder what the small white object was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Garrett Henry had found Hong under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safe. Soon he decided that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike Baskin's trail in the snow, overtake</seg><seg type="columnLine">112</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and find out. Also, he would bring the-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit tie matter of Howling Jim's love-making</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Nancy to a show-down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fifteen minutes more and he had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the footprints for which he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching. They led him up a bank of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creek for a mile and then turned to the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were lost tin bare ground under a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">patch of hemlocks that stood so thickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that their interlaced branches had caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly all the snow that had fallen on them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howling Jim had brought into effect a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woodsman's trick here in order to halt pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible pursuit, and Lonesome suspected it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. Lonesome began to look for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, and soon his gaze rested upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot at which the bare ground ran within</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dozen yards of Big Brother Creek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bentley nodded understanding. Just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baskin had done, he backed off, ran hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaped over the few yards of snowy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, landing somewhere near the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of die shallow stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked a mile up the stony little creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he found Howling Jim's footprints</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading out of it. The trail now took him</seg><seg type="columnLine">high on the side of Little Brother Mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then across an outstanding spur and</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a deep cove, and he was not more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-way down the side of this cove when</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness closed in upon liiin. It was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible, of course, for him to follow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">string of footprints farther before daylight</seg><seg type="columnLine">came again. Lonesome Bentley halted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was chagrined but by no means beaten.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was cold now. His wet feet seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen, and he stamped them on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help the circulation in them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was still, very still, and Lonesome</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood and listened. A few minutes later</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard faintly, coming from somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bottom of the dark cove below him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a snatch of the foolish old song that Howling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim was so fond of singing in a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandon--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm a-goin' to live, anyhow, till I die!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bentley stole softly onward, downward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heading for a tiny point of llame that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly come to life in the woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Howling Jim Baskin sat before a brush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood fire that he had just made at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of an overhanging cliff. The fire made</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing and grotesque shadows there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild forest. Baskin held his wet feet in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet boots near the flames. The muffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of a twig being broken in the snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused him to look around quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lonesome Bentley, seeming doubly stal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wart and doubly serious in the flickering</seg><seg type="columnLine">firelight, walked slowly up and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking straight into the upturned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling lace of his pal. He had suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">an almost overpowering wave of sudden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">insensate anger. It was his intention to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounce Howling Jim as a black traitor to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">iriendship. But in a second's time there</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed on the palimpsest of his brain scenes</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the good old days that he and Baskin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spent together, scenes that pictured</seg><seg type="columnLine">little kindnesses, confidences, almost tender-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, when Lonesome finally spoke, he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">only this--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My feet's about froze, Howlin'."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shore," grinned Baskin. "Mine was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, by grab! Set down and w'arm 'em.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Have any trouble a-trackin' me, Lone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some ?" His voice was full of gladness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not much," Bentley answered. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on, "Do ye reckon Garrett Henry</seg><seg type="columnLine">can foller us. Howlin'?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Him? Humph! No, by grab! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't smart enough for that, nor enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to the woods. But--but they didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have nothin' agin you, Lonesome!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bentley shrugged his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, nothin'--only-they arrested me as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pardner in the rob'ry; that's all. And they</seg><seg type="columnLine">s'arched me and took my money; that's all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I got it back. Jail? Not for me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howlin', ef anybody happens to name it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ye!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He dragged up a flat stone, turned the dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">side up, sat down on it and put his feet over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire. He was at the point of asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howling Jim w'hat it was that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched from Sheriff Henry's hand, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baskin said slowly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leather burns quick when it's wTet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lonesome; don't stick 'em too dost. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way, Lonesome, I got somethin' here</seg><seg type="columnLine">what belongs to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From an inside coat pocket he drew an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened and unstamped and somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumpled letter that had Bentley's name in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thin, feminine scrawl on the envelope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this he passed into the hands of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I never read it, o' course," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bentley took the missive and pocketed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost without looking at it. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful of the few letters Nancy had wTitten</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howling Jim's Pal</seg><seg type="columnLine">113</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and it amazed him to think that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lost one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Much obliged, Howlin'," he muttered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where'd ye find it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was that," said Baskin, "that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff picked up from under the commissary</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe, which I took from him and run with.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I seed the ad-dress afore he did, and I--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowed you never had no business back</seg><seg type="columnLine">there--and I thought--I thought you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," cut in Lonesome. "You thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it'd put me in bad about the safe-robbin',</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you done it to clear me. Well, it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool thing to do, for I never lost the letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, I'm shore! But--btit you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off, flushed slightly and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stir the fire with a boot-heel. Baskin</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up the thread that he had dropped:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Brad had told me jest afore he sent me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ye this mornin', Lonesome, that you was</seg><seg type="columnLine">might' nigh shore to be the camp's high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy purty soon, and I was a-thinkin' about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that when I took the letter and cut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustard for the timber. It'd ha' sp'iled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the job for ye. Lonesome, at least. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowed, y'see, how much ye wanted to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a super. And, as for me," smiling, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">twinkling, "I--well, it don't matter about</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. 'Cause I'm a-goin' to live, anyhow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">till I die! Now ain't 1?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked back to the fire. Lonesome</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned his gaze hard upon the rugged profile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his pal. So this was the fellow whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been about to denounce as a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">traitor to their friendship. Lonesome Bent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley wished vaguely that he were another</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in order that he might kick himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean across Little Brother Mountain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You been mad at me, Lonesome,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly said Howling Jim, without taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes from the glowing coals. "It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly that, too, what made me take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter and run with it. I wisht I knowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you been mad at me about, Lone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bentley told him straightforwardly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I seed you a-holdin' Nancy's hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There on the creek, at the big poplar. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew all over me like powder a-burnin';</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've died a thousand times sence that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute, Howlin'. I reckon I ain't got any</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense. I reckon ye must ha' had some good</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for a-doin' that, but I shore couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see it thataway till now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Howling Jim sat up straight, smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did have a good reason, Lonesome,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "That is, I think I did, by grab!</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll leave it to you. Y^'see, I could easy tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">that somethin' had come between you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and I was a-beggin" her to take ye back</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and a-tellin her what a fine, good young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man ye was and how much ye liked her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and how happy she'd alius be with you!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Was--that--it?" gasped Bentley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God knows it was," said Baskin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went into his corduroy coat and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with something wrapped neatly in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue bandanna. Ever so carefully he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bandamia from it with his big and bun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling but wonderfully gentle hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed it over to his pal. Lonesome took it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and held it up to the dancing firelight. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an old-fashioned tintype picture of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bareheaded and barefooted mountain lass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smiling and pretty little mountain lass in</seg><seg type="columnLine">calico.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My sweetheart," Howling Jim said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is the only real secret I've ever kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">from you, Lonesome. I never talk about it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where is she now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Under the snow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a minute of silence Baskin went on:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I ain't never seed nobody else what</seg><seg type="columnLine">could tak,e her place, and I know I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">will. That's why I go along a-singin' and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a-whoopin' through life, jest to forgit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a-doin' the best I can with the little that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almighty put into my wo'thless cyarcass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I'm mostly jest plain meat, I reckon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It wasn't much o' my business, I know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lonesome, for me to go to Nancy and ax her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take ye back. But--well, I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">mebbe-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all right," said Lonesome. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thank ye for that, Howlin'. A man never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a better pal 'an you, Howlin'. I shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">beg yer pardon for a bein' so low-down mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ye! Here's the little picture."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave Baskin the tintype and rose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would go straight back to Garrett</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry and tell him everything, though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely meant jail for him. Baskin put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture into his pocket, and he, too, went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">liis feet. Just then there came a most sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prizing addition to the little drama there</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the snowy wilderness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOSE two were not the only men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that wild country who knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">woodcraft. An eavesdropper who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stationed himself on the cliff just</seg><seg type="columnLine">above had lost his perilous footing, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">now came hurtling down with a resounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">thump between Lonesome Bentley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ii4</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howling Jim Baskin. The newcomer car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried a revolver in a holster, and he wore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputy's shield on his coat. It was Gideon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ashford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lonesome drew back a little as the Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brother ('reek camp's erstwhile bully</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned a drawn and ashen face upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You was shore in a devil of a hurry to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get here, Gid!" he exclaimed mockingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why couldn't ye jest ha' walked in like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">decent white man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baskin forgot himseLf and raised his fog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">horn voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Drapped right down out o' the blue sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by grab! Do ye bring us any glad message</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the moon, Gid?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ashford struggled there on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them, trying in vain to rise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My laig--" he mumbled. "Oh--my</seg><seg type="columnLine">laig-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By grab!" suddenly cried Howling Jim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ef his laig ain't broke plumb in two, might'</seg><seg type="columnLine">nigh! Look there, Lonesome--it's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled up, and a bone is a-stickin' through</seg><seg type="columnLine">below his knee!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bentley stooped over and saw, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuddered in spite of himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a-bleedin\" Ashford said nerve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly ; "it's a-bleedin'--Lonesome. You and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howlin' git me to a doctor ef ye can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "WTe can, all right," Bentley replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowly. "We could simply take ye to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp, and Super Brad'd shoot ye'down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Jonesville on a loggin'-inglne. But you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what's a-waitin' for us at the camp!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What--Garrett Henry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeuh, Garrett Henry," Baskin nodded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And maybe a jail sentence or two. Ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">cain't ax us to face it, Gid, a-hatin' jail like</seg><seg type="columnLine">we does. But we're sorry for ye, 'count o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">seein' ve so bad hurt. Though it might ha'</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarved ye jest about right for a-snoopin' up</seg><seg type="columnLine">there on the clitt, a-listenin' to us open our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts to the bottom. Still, we're sorry for</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye, Gid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm much obliged, shore," tremulously</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled Ashford. "But you a-bein' sorry</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me don't do me a dang bit o' good!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ef I might ax," drawled Lonesome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing to the deputy's shield that Ashford</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore, "how comes it that ye're a sportin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">that little bright thing on ye coat ? 'Cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's purty?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this thrust Gideon Ashford stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently. His broken limb was beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give him exerutiating pain now. Baskin</seg><seg type="columnLine">winked slyly at his sober-faced pal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And he's a-carryin' that .45, I reckon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lonesome, to keep anybody from a-takin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the badge offen him! Say, Gid, that shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks to me like Sheriff Henry's gun. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">much did he offer ye to bring us in? Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth, or I wisht I may drap dead in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks ef I turn a hand to he'p ye. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">goodness knows ye're in a bad fix' out here</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from nowhere and not able to walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">a step and ready to bleed to death."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ashford didn't answer. He glanced to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the widening red circle in the snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his leg, and fear gripped his heart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strings. Lonesome Bentley looked mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly at Howling Jim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'd better light a rag awfay from here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howlin'," said he. "The sheriff might</seg><seg type="columnLine">come enny minute. Come on; le's go.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good night to ye, Gid!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two turned from the fire, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">.Ashford staring after them with eyes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'ere afraid and full of pain, and started up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cove in the silent darkness. When they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone well out of the circle of firelight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baskin nudged his companion and whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do ye really mean to leave him that-</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, Lonesome? Wasn't we a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough to him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We won't go far," Bentley whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. "Maybe we was a little rough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but it was in self-defense. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">y'see, Howlin'? Ef Gid knows anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboul the rob'rv, mebbe he'll tell it as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">price of us a-carrvin' him to the camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knows he'll die here, and jail is alius</seg><seg type="columnLine">betler'n death to a skunk. I got a notion</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gid is the robber hisself. Howlin', 'cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's die only man in the outfit what's</seg><seg type="columnLine">low-down enough to pull off a job like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've wondered ef it could possibly ha'</seg><seg type="columnLine">been Billy Allison. He's sort o' light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed. Lonesome, a-bein ■' not much more'n</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boy. IIow could Gid ha' got the safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">open?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ax somebody else. I don't know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A jerking, agonized yell from Gideon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ashford cut Bentley's speech short:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lonesome, come back! I'll make it safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">for ye at the camp!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two pals turned and walked slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the now low-burned fire. Ashford</seg><seg type="columnLine">slopped his groaning long enough to suggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they carry him to the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp clearing and leave him there. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howling Jim's Pal</seg><seg type="columnLine">115</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't listen, and Ashford began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">groan again. Finally he broke down com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take me to Garrett Henry," he begged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and I'll dear ye both. It was me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbed the safe. It was me that drapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the letter there at the safe, but I didn't do</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a-purpose. I never knowed I'd lost it</seg><seg type="columnLine">till Henry found it. I hid the six hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars in the up-stairs o' the boardin'-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. Nancy, she handed me that letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give to you, Lonesome, and I--I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Opened it and read it," clipped Bentley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"like .skunks alius does.

Hurry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lonesome, for I'm a-hurtin' awful, and I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruther go to jail 'an to die out here in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, by grab!" almost shouted Howling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Baskin as he knelt to fashion a blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandanna tourniquet for Ashford's tom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleeding limb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Baskin worked with the injured</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, Lonesome took Nancy's letter from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket, the letter that he had thought an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old one, and read it by the firelight. In it</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nancy declared that she had hardly slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">since she had broken her engagement with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and asked him to forgive her, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, for having been such a fool. Bent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley's heart leaped almost to liis throat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his smile was broad as he remembered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had once started to her to beg her for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">giveness for that same white little sin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN days later, more or less,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came a bright and sunny</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunday afternoon when the snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all gone. Bentley and Nancy walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the woods path that led from old Nathan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirkland's hewn-log cabin, entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grassy clearing that held the logging-camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Big Brother Creek and went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarding-house porch. There they turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to face smilingly some thirty stalwart</seg><seg type="columnLine">timberjacks who had just broken off their</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual Sunday afternoon horse-play to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boys," began the strong young man on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the porch, removing his broad-brimmed hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a rather grandiose sweep of his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, "I beg permission to interduce Missis</seg><seg type="columnLine">Superintendent Lonesome Bentley. Wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">us well, boys!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first there was a mere murmur of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound among the loggers; then a ripple--</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a wild and hearty yell rose from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">throats and shattered itself against the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountainsides. Bentley began to look the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loggers over a trifle anxiously. WTiere was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howling Jim? He had invited Baskin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be present at his wedding, but Baskin</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't promised. A hundred times before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had located his pal by merely listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him; so now he raised a hand for silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silence came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From somewhere high on the laurel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered breast of the everlasting Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brother there came to the ears of those in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley a half-sad voice lifted up in a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of abandon:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ye may break-a my bones with-a sticks ana</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   stones--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I'm a-goin' to live, anyhow, till I die!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       Author oj "Heathens," "The Devil's Own," etc.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The first part of the story briefly retold in story form.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" U URRICANE" WILLIAMS, clad in a pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trousers cut off at the knee, his skin burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">black as that of a savage by the sun of the Southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pacific, looked out from under heavy brows at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender young man before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gilbert Lang," he said, "I am an outlaw--a#</seg><seg type="columnLine">nigger-lover. The most hated and despised white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the South Sea Islands. Why do you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come with me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silently Lang held out a hand which bore a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring on which were carved Greek Letters. Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized the hand and gazed at the ring keenly. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked a question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Man or woman?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Both--probably. I know they came to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of these islands, and I was told that you went</seg><seg type="columnLine">about on these islands more than any man. So I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Williams motioned to two handsome young</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages, who came running.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They will get your traps ashore and bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">them here," he said to Lang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Gilbert Lang came to be the only while</seg><seg type="columnLine">follower of Hurricane Williams. Of black followers</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams had many. A swarm of Tongans and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Samoans, men and women, boys and girls, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams as he went about the Soulh Seas, trading,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fishing, wandering, lie was known as a terror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was far more intelligent than I he traders who</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated him. And he had nothing to do with white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men until Gilbert Lang came to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vengeance is mine," was written in Greek on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring that l&gt;ang wore, and the three words told</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had brought him to the South Sea*. It was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">revenge himself on the man and woman--brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sister, supposedly--who had killed his brother.</seg><seg type="columnLine">George and Alice Brown were their names, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alice Brown had been his brother's wife. Lang</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never seen either. He had sought them across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth to the South Seas and joined fortunes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Williams that he might seek them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">belter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly he became accustomed to the strange Lite.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The savages he found childlike in their happiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and love of play. The old men and women petted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; the young men became his comrades; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young girls coquetted with him; the children played</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Williams took the whole party on board</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ship, the Mary, and sailed to an island where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew of oyster-beds. Williams half expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">a light at the oyster beds. Not with the natives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for lie quickly made friends with Ghorki, chief of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Gopassa people, and with Baraka, the devil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil man. But with Willerby, king of the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seas, who also knew of the wealth of the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Lang sat alone one day. Uala. most beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the native girls, crept up to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "f love you," she said softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lang was lonesome and homesick. Uala was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful. He kissed her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Langl" He heard an angry voice behind him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he turned to see Williams glare at him a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then stride away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">GILBERT Lang was suffused with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feeling of guilt and shame. He,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a quest of vengeance, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped to dalliance, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage! Memory of it would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">distressing enough without having to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member that Williams had come upon them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams was an enigma. Much about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was distasteful, yet his tense, dominant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">personality in a certain way compelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration, and though Gilbert Lang tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell himself that he cared not one way or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other for Williams' approval, yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that it was not so. He did care.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wished that he might not have to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">116</seg><seg type="columnLine">SAVAGES</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Tour-Vart Story</seg><seg type="columnLine">Part f]</seg><seg type="columnLine">BY GORDON TOl/NG</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What tidal folly could have so swept him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his senses? True, Uala was beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sweet. But at best she was a native.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps those pretty teeth of hers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked dead men's bones! He shivered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had kissed her again and again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tears of rage and shame came to his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood there glistening. The very</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of her evoked something of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascination of her presence, and he tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to loath himself for his weakness in not</seg><seg type="columnLine">being thoroughly disgusted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbert Lang was one of those complex</seg><seg type="columnLine">organisms that can only be bred far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields and forests. The noblesse oblige of</seg><seg type="columnLine">culture was ingrained in him--or, rather, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">veneered him. All men are emotionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">alike deep down in their hearts; only in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">the emotions are rarely, if ever, stirred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a clean-hearted, pure-eyed boy; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was very young, and he had come from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot-house world into jungles. He was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered that there was within him unsus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected emotions--weaknesses, to his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thinking--that leaped up like monsters</seg><seg type="columnLine">conjured by a wizard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had killed men; he had pressed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips to the mouth of a savage woman! No.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilbert Lang did not know, could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, that the roots of him were down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mold; that he was a human being and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing more; that the only difference be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween him and a bushman was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">superficial difference of color and culture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was no more aware of that than he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that he, aVid all men, carry within</seg><seg type="columnLine">them traces of the gills that served then-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amphibian ancestors.	*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he lay homesick, heart-sick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shamed; lay on his face, and his face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried in the crook of his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was late in the afternoon when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up, and he rubbed his eyes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprize.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three ships had entered the bay. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew nothing of ships, but one was larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Lhe other two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The first flash into his brain was that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get passage out on one of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got up and hurried down to the beach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even he thought it strange that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so few natives in sight. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary had come in, the water was alive with</seg><seg type="columnLine">outriggers, and the beach crowded. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only the beach but the village seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted. Here and there a little group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives stood watching, but that was all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A boat was being rowed in from one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbert Lang went out on the jetty' built</seg><seg type="columnLine">of coral rocks that ran some distance out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to deep water, and there he waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the boat made for the jetty, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that it contained three white men be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides the black boys at the oars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the-'s the matter?" a roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice called at him some fifty yards from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing as the boat came on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing," he shouted back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbert Lang soon thought--and never</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward changed his opinion--that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burly, short-legged man with the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring voice was the most profane individ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ual on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jeb Jackson never spoke without swear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.

And who the--are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boat, skilfully guided by the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, who steered with an oar, slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside, missing the rocks by the width</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a lady's hand, and Jeb Jackson leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the jetty before the other men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat had even steadied themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">upright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My name is Gilbert La--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gilbert, eh?" said Jackson, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">him over critically.

He always did most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, aud there was scant chance of any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupting him, for his was the booming</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of an old-time mate, who, in addition</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a leather throat, had a barrel-like chest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE he was talking, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">other white men, both heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed, climbed on the jetty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood curiously looking at Gilbert Lang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of these men was obviously a sailor, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boatswain perhaps. The other was a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who seemed almost as much out of place at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gopassa as Gilbert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was rather thin and dark-hued, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with die darkness and body of the Latin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes were black and cunning, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth wore an unconscious, wicked sneer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was neatly dressed in white duck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore a yachting cap. He carried a rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wore two revolvers. The other man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as heavily equipped. Jeb Jackson did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have anything in the way of a weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come here' you seventh son of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother of Satan,''Jackson shoutedat the lone</seg><seg type="columnLine">native; then, changing to the pidgin English</seg><seg type="columnLine">used and understood throughout almost the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole of the South Seas, he demanded again</seg><seg type="columnLine">that "you fellow'' come closer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baraka cautiously edged nearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "DuBeque, this is Gilbert. Ain't a</seg><seg type="columnLine">missionary', are you?" Jackson said, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dertaking to introduce the man in white</seg><seg type="columnLine">duck and at the same time make sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy was not one of those most dreaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hated persons in the islands. That is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaded and hated by the men who sailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with and for Willerby. The large ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">moored out in the bay was the Bcbe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pleased to meet you,*' said DuBeque</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, politely, perhaps influenced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilbert Lang's embarrassed but emphatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">denial that he was a missionary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in his momentary' confusion he</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglected to explain that his name was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilbert but Gilbert Lang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DuBeque talked with a soft and fluid</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease; words came from his tongue smooth as</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripping oil, and his voice was low-pitched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost melodious, but just a little too</seg><seg type="columnLine">unctuous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Jackson was trying to hold conver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation with the wily Baraka, DuBeque</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched his voice low and in about thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidential seconds explained that he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cousin were the guests of Winston</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby, who had quite a party on board -</seg><seg type="columnLine">a charmmg and lively party--and they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not expected to find any white men at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gopassa. They were very much puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the attitude of the* natives, for it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnatural and usually indicated hostile</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention for the natives to stay off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water and beach when a ship came in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DuBeque obviously said what he did in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expectation that Gilbert would in turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">sjjeak of himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Gilbert did. He had at first no</seg><seg type="columnLine">liking for DuBeque's face, but DuBeque</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed a gentleman. It was a pleasure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear English spoken fluently and quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. And Gilbert was interested and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeful to learn that there was a party of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white people on the Bebe. He said that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had'been traveling about with Hurricane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams, who came to Gopassa some weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">before after pearls, and he could not imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was the matter with the natives, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were certainly not hostile but friendly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">very friendly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DuBeque scarcely heard the last of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilbert Lang's septence. He hastily glided</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and prodded Jacksdn into an al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titude of attention, saying excitedly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hurricane Williams is here. Pearling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Gilbert came with him. Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">has stirred up the niggers, as usual."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson gave a questioning grunt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at Gilbert Lang doubtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You come with Williams?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jackson seemed skeptical. Gilbert did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not look at all like the sort of a man Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams w'ould take up with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that tiger-shark is here? Pearling?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Funny fellow, that Williams, ain't he?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson asked in a tone that passed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">low with him, but his voice rumbled like</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant thunder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbert readily admitted that Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">was strange at times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you say he's got these niggers primed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for trouble with us, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, he didn't say that," DuBeque</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily put in. "I did You know wher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever this beach-comber goes he makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble for white men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Does he now?" Jackson asked. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something peculiar in his manner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">119</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's notorious," DuBeque insisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Seems to me I've heard o' him,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Jackson with a shade of irony in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, and the irony, though lost to Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beque's cars, caught Gilbert Lang's atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jeb Jackson had formerly been mate on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yankee whaler. That was years ago. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had beaten up a bullying, half-crazed skip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per, then had taken to the beach and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed in the South Seas ever since, eventu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally going into the employ of Winston</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DuBeque swore viciously in his low, oily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth way, and said there was not a decent</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the South Seas who had not heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams. And said that he was a trouble-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're right. You're right, son," Jack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son answered casually. "He's the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">little trouble-maker--an' finisher--in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts. Old W. W. ought to be quite inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested. He's wished 'nough times he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">run across him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the way, Gilbert," DuBeque asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, "come back with us to the ship?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to introduce you to Willerby.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fine fellow to know. Will you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall be pleased," said Gilbert Lang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jackson grunted. He knew Paul Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beque and why DuBeque wanted to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilbert back to the ship, where he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby could question him about Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, you, below there!" Jackson shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the boat. "Throw up that</seg><seg type="columnLine">raffle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The "raffle" was odds and ends of trade</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods, which the black boys threw up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson. He had brought presents for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">village, but, as none other than Baraka ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached, Jackson generously presented the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole lot to him. Jackson was not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trader. He was a seaman. Willerby was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a goods eaman himself when sober, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept Jackson near him and gave him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard and dangerous work to do--as going</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore to a village that appeared hostile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul DuBeque was a man after Willerby's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. He had known Paul for years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also he had known Paul's cousin--Lania--</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronounced La-nigh-a--DuBeque. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">months before there had been trouble be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween Willerby and the DuBeques, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter fled into hiding, but recently every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing had been patched over and the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">relations resumed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbert Lang got into the boat, and, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it shoved away from the jetty, he wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he might never again set foot on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">island. He expected to, however. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on board the Bebe with no intention</seg><seg type="columnLine">of not returning. He was beginning rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">to like DuBeque, who was more friendly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">courteous than any other man met since</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving Honolulu. And Jackson, too, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of profanity, seemed to be only a big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"hale, hearty fellow. But Gilbert Lang</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensed that Jackson had a kind of veiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt for DuBeque.</seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg><seg type="columnLine">HTHE Bebe was moored a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fifty yards from the jetty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">within shouting distance of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the luggers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An awning that served to keep away rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">or sun was stretched over the poop. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">six-pound brass cannon with a carriage that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be run to port or starboard was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waist. This was ostensibly for pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection, but Winston WTillerby occasionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">took upon himself the prerogatives of Euro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pean men-of-war and shelled a village. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">those days and until recently, very re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cently, if a white man got killed or hurt in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a coast village--no matter why or how--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a war-ship happened to come along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even months afterward, the village was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelled to show the savages that they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not trifle with the lives of civilized men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willerby was a big man in many a way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He really was. He had a genius for trade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for commerce, and what he may have lacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in attention to details and good manage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment he made up in jealously keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivals from the field. He was a large-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodied man with a shaven red face, a heavy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jowled face, and gray eyes. His magnifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cence was unapproached in the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seas, in Australia even. The Bebe was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful ship and a floating palace. Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lerby made money and spent it, and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the least of his expenditures were for food</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drink. The chef on the Bebe had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn by Willerby's princely wage from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger-steamer. Her immense refriger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ator was stored with ice. Rumor had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Willerby every six months had a ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">load of ice brought to his plantation in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fijis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willerby spent most of his time at sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in good company. He kept a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">120</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">orchestra that furnished music for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightly dance, for, now that he was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth and influence--if not officially--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">king, he never hailed without companions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half dozen or more guests. Trading-</seg><seg type="columnLine">s tat ions were to be visited, the Australian</seg><seg type="columnLine">markets investigated and the footholds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">independent traders to be jarred loose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He combined business with pleasure and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried new stocks for his traders, took on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board the contents of their warehouses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ever ready to carry out any new scheme</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had money in it. And pearling had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar fascination for him, not only be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause the shell was valuable but because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have a genuine passion for pearls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had luggers at Thursday Island and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooner that every year visited Paumotu</seg><seg type="columnLine">reefs. Any one who reported a new oyster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed coidd always gain his ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun disappeared with almost the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenness of being swallowed by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">black cosmic monster .that lurked near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">western horizon just as the boat bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilbert Lang approached the Bcbe, but her</seg><seg type="columnLine">poop was ablaze with lanterns, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy shapes of men and women could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen through the rays of the lanterns;</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices raised in laughter and bantering</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be heard far out on the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbert Lang followed DuBeque up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea-ladder and to the poop. After them</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the burly, barrel body of Jackson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbert Lang's first impression was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some attractive though unreal world into</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had been thrown. Two white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coated Chinese boys moved about on noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less feet with trays and glasses in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tinkling of ice wras heard. Women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful w'omen, white w'omen, in brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">gowns and jewels--scarcely less resplendent</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lantern-light than if they all had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuine--were grouped about men in pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">duck suits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The soft lights took much of the hardness</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the faces that he saw'. The honest</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun would have shown him that there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a face there unmarked with a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunning or without the scars of sin: no face</seg><seg type="columnLine">but one, and hers was beautiful in the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the evilest of women's often are for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some few years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lania DuBeque had the flashing bizarre</seg><seg type="columnLine">face that lures even the wise, the unillu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioned, to folly. Some men, many in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be sufficiently inexpert in character</seg><seg type="columnLine">perception to believe her words and pose</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she assumed a certain innocence</seg><seg type="columnLine">Others, most others, might know all there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to knowr about her and yet not care.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hei voice, too, was soft and smooth; sw'eet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plausible her words--unless she spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">in anger, when a fishwife might well have</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   She sat in a chair, a long wicker chair, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by her sat Winston Willerby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I hough it could at once be perceived that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she l-Hjre a family resemblance to DuBeque,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">still she did not have either his eyes or his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mouth Her face was not regular in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1 lassical fashion. The faces of fascinating wo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">men never are. In such faces there is a unique</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">irregularity that first arrests the surprized</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attention; then the beholder more or less</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swiftly is likely to come under the spell of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her serpentine personality. There seems</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to be something serpentine, wicked, about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all really fascinating women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Hurricane Williams is over there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">DuBeque shouted breathlessly to Willerby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The people about the deck drew near to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">listen. Most of them stared at Gilbert</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lang, stared in that curious noncommital</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way that leaves people free to accept the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stranger as a comrade or a spoil-sport.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But their stares were not long nor steady.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Most of them looked at DuBeque, who was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very much excited, and some of them who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knew of Hurricane Williams glanced re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">peatedly at Willerby to see how he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taking DuBeque's information.</seg><seg type="columnLine">9^9 BUT Lania did not take her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">off Gilbert Lang's face. From un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der her long lashes she watched him</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily. Two long pendant black pearls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at her ears--not pear-shaped pearls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but baroques that had been matched with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some care and a great deal of luck. Any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one finding a large, shield-like baroque</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never expect to find its mate, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances would be infinitely reduced if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baroque were black. 'Tis an old saying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and true; j&gt;erhaps old as the pearl-fishers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arabian w'aters from whence were drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls of great price for Solomon, "Match</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pearl, and you double the value of both."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Those pendant earrings were without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">price. They could not be purchased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Many women had worn them. They were,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a wav, the tiara of Willerby's court. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a herald had cried it forth in a stentorian</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">voice, it would not have been better known</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the woman who wore them was not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">121</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">receive attention from other men: it would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be perilous for her and for the men. Lania</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had first worn those earrings a year and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more before and the eldest son of a lord</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had fallen in love with her. Lania and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Paul DuBeque fled. The lord was notified</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by letter that reached to his English</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">manor house that his son and heir had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hauled under by sharks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbert Lang did not notice how she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching him. He, too, was listening to</seg><seg type="columnLine">DuBeque and looking again and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Willerby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's trying to make trouble. Look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way the natives act! And pearling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">your grounds! Here is the chance to catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">that pirate. He--" indicating Gilbert--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"can give you the details," DuBeque con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willerby's fingers opened and shut writh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly on the arms of the chair, and liis face</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew red and more red with apoplectic rage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked Gilbert up and down and through</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, too. Willerby was something of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge of men. He sometimes said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">none were to be trusted, which is a common</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion among men of large financial</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs, but still he had had to pick his</seg><seg type="columnLine">traders, his agents and managers. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew some tiling of men, and he was trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to comprehend what that frail boy with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">refined, not quite matured, face was doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with W'illiams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you're in with him. are you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby said hoarsely, menacingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Gilbert Lang; "I took pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage with him out of the Carolines. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know nothing about his business. He said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was an outlaw, and he has influence with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the natives, and he is pearl-fishing. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is about all I know of him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Gilbert Lang spoke the truth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was glad that he could say that and know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was true. He had no love for Williams,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though a certain exasperating admiration--</seg><seg type="columnLine">much like the charm of Uala--rose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to time. But just at that moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rather afternoon and evening, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to be able to say that they were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely associated, scarcely acquaintances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly not friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A heavy guttural grunt rolled up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chest of Jackson, who had been standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">impassively near-by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbert Lang glanced at him. Jackson said</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing; he merely looked back at Gilbert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lang. But the look made the boy angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Jackson, angry with himself, angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Williams. The huge sailor seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently expressing contempt for one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">denied his friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Gilbert Lang did not consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams his friend. He said so. He said</seg><seg type="columnLine">so to Willerby, but it was for Jackson that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke. And every second Lania's steady-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark eyes, peering alertly from under</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumbrous lids, were on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm glad to know' that. Glad to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, boy," said W'illerby, who believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willerby spoke not in a hospitable man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner but ratlier as a judge who has dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that the suspected person is inno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent of everything but bad company.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what are you doin' down here?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tell me that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbert Lang was impaled by that ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Willerby required an answer. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumed the right to know the wrherefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrhy of every man's presence if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the remote chance of it interfering with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Willerby interests. Gilbert Lang</seg><seg type="columnLine">could no more tell his story than he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been gratuitously insulting. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebuke that Williams had given him when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had ventured to mention the tragedy back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his request had left a scar deep within</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and, besides, here were many ears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of them sympathetic. But Gilbert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lang could not pose as a trader or a scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist or any of those tilings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Willerby," he said, "I came dowm</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the South Seas to rather look around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I didn't have the faintest idea that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'as nearly as large as it is. I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrant to call myself an 'adventurer', but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is about the nearest to it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Has Williams been gettin' pearls?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not that I know of."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's got that gang of niggers with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasn't he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Samoans and Tongans."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By - I'll get him and get him to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night!" Willerby cried, springing up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wholly unconscious of the dramatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">value of his words and manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was angry, but he was not too beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to note the admiring murmurs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of his guests--if such a parasitical lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be called by that ancient and honor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll steal a march on him," Willerby</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on, interrupting the statement of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">intentions at this point to curse the soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">122</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and body of Williams. Then: "Jackson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you take what men you need. No lights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand. Land on the beach. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy'll go along and show you the way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grab him and get back before his niggers</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you have him. I want to tell that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow to his face what I think of him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willerby ended abruptly with a signifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cant sweep of his arm that suggested push-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing somebody overboard into the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll make your fortune for you," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to the horrified boy. "From this day</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Winston Willerby is behind you. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">that means something down in this country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His question was an appeal to those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood about him, and emphatic words</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing hastily from male and female</seg><seg type="columnLine">throats, many of them loud words so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might be sure which throat had spoken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed that it meant much: it was the great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est thing that could happen to a man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Seas. Some of the women cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculating glances at Gilbert Lang. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had suddenly become worth while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only Lania DuBeque remained silent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was above such flattery. Hers was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more subtle. Besides, she was sure of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">position on board the Bebe or at the home</seg><seg type="columnLine">plantation in the Fijis. But not for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">second did she take her eyes off Gilbert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lang. There was something about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy that more than interested her--almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbed her. She could not tell what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," Willerby continued, in the large</seg><seg type="columnLine">way that a man may assume when by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile or a frown he has the power to affect</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fortunes of others, ^'you're in with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winston Willerby from now on. Just go</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with Jackson here and point out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that--'s hut, and Jackson and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men'll do the rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Gilbert Lang had found Williams a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarly unfriendly man and disagreeable</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as at times terrifying. The boy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been born into a home and raised in sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings where a very deep and sincere</seg><seg type="columnLine">religious feeling existed. Williams had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been constantly blasphemous. More even</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that, Williams had on one horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion said that he would not crook a</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger to stop a cannibal feast. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">many reasons for disliking as well as fearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams, and few were known for liking him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True, he had awakened out of his feverish</seg><seg type="columnLine">delirium to find himself in Williams* hut</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hammock, but Gilbert Lang knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of Williams' vigils, his unremitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention. He knew 110 more of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">things than of Lula's gift of her precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife to Baraka as the price for exorcising</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devil out of him. It was natural that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilbert Lang would, almost invariably,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake discourtesy--such as was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuous in Williams--for a kind of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsiveness of character.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not feel the jiersonal loyalty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the comrade for Williams, and, being very</seg><seg type="columnLine">young, as well as more or less unconsciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager to tell something--to give information</seg><seg type="columnLine">--which is an impulse by no means re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricted to the youthful--he had been un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of the ugly sound his words had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he disclaimed all knowledge of Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams' business and all friendship for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Willerby's suggestion smote Gilbert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lang as an insult would have done. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way it was an insult To deny friendship</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Williams was one thing: to deliver him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hands of the unfriendly was another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Willerby," he said, his voice trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling from the effort to remain calm, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not think of doing such a thing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you propose!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was silence about the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">as those unexpected words fell from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips. Willerby looked at him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">just looked, as a monarch might stare at</seg><seg type="columnLine">some poor fool who had done an incom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehensible thing. DuBeque's evil lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">I&gt;arted in a kind of amazed gasp. Jeb</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson slipped his thumbs into his belt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned against the railing and sort of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laxed into the attitude of a spectator.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson's face was heavily bearded; so no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one could detect the sort of a smile that ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">along his mouth. Lania DuBeque nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowed her eyes and leaned slightly forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Willerby cut loose. He cursed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy with a boatswain's tongue, accused him</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being a Williams spy, of the same breed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ilk as that thrice-damnable thief and</seg><seg type="columnLine">white cannibal, as well as an ingrate! For</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't he, Willerby, about to make his,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilbert Lang's, fortune? And that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of his repay!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jackson," he concluded, "throw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into irons! He'll never get off this ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">again--alive!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it was that Lania DuBeque gasped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her black eyes, suddenly fierce, shifted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby's face, and she put out a hand as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if tc protest. But the hand fell again</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the arm of her chair. She lay back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept silent, watching Gilbert Lang in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy, slender, pale with anger, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused by the injustice, stared at Willerby.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby was furious, but Gilbert Lang</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought such an order must at most be</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a threat. Men did not do such things!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Jackson, taking a half dozen steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, called from the poop for Grogan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the.third mate, and Grogan came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Irons. An' drop him down the for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward hatch," said Jackson carelessly with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gesture toward Gilbert Lang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Git!" cried DuBeque, ever anxious in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some distinguishing way to aid the wishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Willerby, as he gave the boy a shove and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbert Lang wheeled and leaped. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">smote the fastidious DuBeque on Lhe mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">anci whirled another fist to the jaw. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dormant blood of his fighting forefathers</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had raised to prestige the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lang was foaming in his veins. Again, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the raiding bushmen, he knew no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear and had no thought of it. Injustice set</seg><seg type="columnLine">him wild. Wrillerby's order to throw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into irons had made him like a barrel of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry powder, but it was DuBeque who ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied the match.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lauia DuBeque sprang to her feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew back. She did not cry out. Others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were doing that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fight was short. Its length was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely countable in seconds. It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">really a fight, for Paul DuBeque did noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but scream and try to protect himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">by bending down and covering his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Jackson, profanity flowing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bearded mouth, reached out a powerful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberate arm and gripped Gilbert Lang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then DuBeque remembered the revolvers</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his side and snatched at them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> WiLh feline swiftness Lania pushed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one side, crying--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You fool!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willerby was storming and ordering all</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of terrible things at once to be done</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jo Gilbert Lang--whose name he even did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know, had not heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Jackson, half pushing and half</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying the boy down the poop ladder</seg><seg type="columnLine">t urned him over to Grogan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put him somewhere so W. W. don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumble across him. Stick him some place</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to keep him from 'scaping--an' DuBeque</seg><seg type="columnLine">from knifin' him," said Jackson to Grogan</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then aloud with lurid oaths he roared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grogan to make Gilbert Lang lament the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day of his birth and that he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned manners enough not to strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen in the face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A-r-r-right!" said Grogan hoarsely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercely, jerking the struggling, dazed boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">along as easily as a man might pull a frail</seg><seg type="columnLine">child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willerby was beside himself. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">often beside himself. But familiarity with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rage did not breed contempt in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who lived on the ship with him. True,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lania DuBeque had a way of seeming un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressed. But, if there was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the roaring bull in him. there was a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of the tiger in her. Probably no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman would ever have returned as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">did to face Willerby's jealous rage when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fled it; possibly she was ashamed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself for having fled, and that was why</seg><seg type="columnLine">she returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Too, she may have been aware of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">charms and confident. It is the conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of beauty, not of brains, that makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">women daring in that picaresque, sensa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional way that frequently startles not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">communities but nations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Willerby stamped the deck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stormed, all but Lania and Paul DuBeque</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew respectfully away from him. Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beque, presuming somewhat on his bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered face, solicitiously felt of his swollen</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, and a finger with a delicate touch ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">along his jawr to see if it wTere really broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take the crews off the luggers and every</seg><seg type="columnLine">man off the Bcbc and go get that fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">W'illiams!" Willerby shouted at Jackson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bring him here! I'll tend to him! I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">show him that Winston Willerby can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made a fool of. Send that girlish kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">here as a spy, will he? By - 1*11 cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes out and use 'em for fish-bait! Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you hear me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," Jackson rumbled. "I hear you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what?" Willerby demanded im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can muster about ten white men."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He paused to let his eyes sweep the guests</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the background, who. though white men</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and women--were not included in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muster.

Jackson, for scarcely more of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason than that he was half-drunk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard-fisted, had once upon a time knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a black boy on a beach, when there</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly appeared a man, half-mated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly scarcely more than half of Jack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's size.

Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lerby repeated contemptuously. "DuBeque,</seg><seg type="columnLine">take what men you want and bring that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow here--alive!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby said it with a majestic flourish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He laid his hand on DuBeque's shoulder as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a king might lay an accolade on some</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscure soldiet who was being raised to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">post of honor and danger abandoned by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">craven captain. But the dramatic climax</seg><seg type="columnLine">was close to being ruined by something</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling a snicker that ran thfough the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group, and DuBeque's knees threatened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give way beneath his amazement. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lania smiled understanding^ and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">without enjoyment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jackson was a good sailor and in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">125</seg><seg type="columnLine">largely ill-charted or uncharted waters as</seg><seg type="columnLine">good a navigator as Willerby could expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find in combination with a certain un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrupulousness and close-mouthed loyalty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He valued the last as much as seamanship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so Jackson often presumed upon that</seg><seg type="columnLine">value, as in the instance of his refusal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">try kidnaping Hurricane Williams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DuBeque, having bluffed, realised well</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough that it was ruinous not to pretend</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least to be proud and make the effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of the things which DuBeque may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have lacked in courage he replaced with</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'TU go alone," he said. "Just let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">have enough men to row the boat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There probably was not a person who</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard him, excepting Willerby, who did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not believe that DuBeque rejected com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions so there would be no witnesses to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deny the story he could tell by way of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaining his failure.

He said that many</seg><seg type="columnLine">would attract attention and they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the whole villages and Williams'</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives on them in the darkness. He be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved he could manage alone better. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the boat ready and give him time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wash up a little. A vague idea of what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be able to do had come to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he walked to the companion way</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the conscious importance of a hero.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willerby was pleased with him, said</seg><seg type="columnLine">things of praise, and others had to agree</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily with the compliments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lania slipped away unnoticed and follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed DuBeque, coming into his cabin as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood with a wash-rag in hand before a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm proud of you, Paul.

Much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lania had no love for Paul--no more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had for her. But down deep in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart she was afraid of him. She always</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been afraid of him. And he was far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from being indifferent to her anger. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had somewhat pooled their fortunes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, though rather distrustful of each other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had accepted a common alliance against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others with whom Willerby took up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, there was the tie of blood which</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather singled them out for the "alliance"</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than gave strength to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Paul should be killed, Lania would</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed tears, appear inconsolable and really</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss him. But she would be relieved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She rather wished at times that something</seg><seg type="columnLine">would happen to him. But she never</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed it, and not altogether futilely she</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept up a pretense of affection: not so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">because she was a hypocrite as because she</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew very well that "something" would</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen to her if Paul ever became aware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hei real feeling toward him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pfcnlll WHEN DuBeque came on deck, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">p ^four-piece orchestra was strumming</seg><seg type="columnLine">P^H.iwav below, and the harmony came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to deck through the- open skylight. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">few, one or two couples, were dancing; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others sat around laughing and drinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the trays of the white-clad, noiseless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">footed Chinamen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was far from being the gay, social,</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-hearted group that it appeared to be--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that those in it tried to deceive themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">into believing that it was. Normal people</seg><seg type="columnLine">on shipboard quickly grow tired of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another. And these people were not nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal. They had no common denominator</seg><seg type="columnLine">of interest except what they could get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Willerby. Each was jealous of the other;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they gossiped furiously, sometimes quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reled and were nightly drunk. Yet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women wore gaudy dresses and imitation</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones; the men had clean pressed duck</seg><seg type="columnLine">from day to day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Paul, don't get hurted," cooed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp-tongued little blonde.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What're you going to do?

It's too risky.

He. began to be exceedingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful that he had undertaken more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wise and seriously debated blowing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lantern and sitting himself down for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, then reappearing with some stirring</seg><seg type="columnLine">story of what he had tried to do. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stung by the knowledge that almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody on board expected him to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">some such thing as that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His story might not even fool Willerby.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The old man had surprizing and fiery moods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was not a pleasant one to whom to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port failures, no matter how they were gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nished with details of the efforts made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now it is not for one minute to be sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed that DuBeque would have ventured</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Gopassa if he had really believed any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the more barbarous tilings that he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">others pretended to believe about Williams.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the Bebe came in, those on board had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been surprized and a little suspicious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble because the natives kept out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">128</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight, but DuBeque very craftily realized,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after he had blundered into his request to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go for Williams, that, if Gilbert Lang had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived among these natives for weeks and felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">no fear, it was comparatively safe for him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">DuBeque, to go into the village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was pretty well known, too, that Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams tried to avoid trouble, but crowd him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threaten him, and it was something like</seg><seg type="columnLine">tying a flaming torch to the tail and a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">rag to the horn of a wild bull. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reason why DuBeque had summoned up</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage enough to appear to be unarmed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">DuBeque knew that he was really running</seg><seg type="columnLine">but little risk, but he had a difficult time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel that way about it. He had lived in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Seas long enough to be familiar with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that the coast natives, as a rule, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wanton murderers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True, some head-hunter is always likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be the prowling exception, and the of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fenses of one white man are apt to be vicari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously expiated by feasting from the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">who comes. But, if Gilbert Lang had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the run of the village, he, DuBeque, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be reasonably safe. DuBeque had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunning enough to see that, though he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">some trouble in summoning up courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to act on it. And, while there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">none to deny that Hurricane Williams was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous man, there were some to defend</seg><seg type="columnLine">his character: particularly the old-timers</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had married native wives and settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to patriarchal dignity and who re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented the encroachment of civilization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DuBeque was confident that, if he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">come face to face with Williams, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the end of his scheme all right. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cold with fear, jumpy and nervous by</seg><seg type="columnLine">being forced to walk alone in the ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious night, fringed--one might sa\--</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the jungle growth. Yet he had to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. He would not, for almost anything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have let those on the Bebe know what words</seg><seg type="columnLine">he intended to use to Williams. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were depths within depths to the cunning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paul DuBeque.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DuBeque had left the jetty and was walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up the beach toward a hut, the shaggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof of which was faintly perceptible in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimmest of starlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A voice close at hand called out in painful</seg><seg type="columnLine">English--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jerk of the lantern showed how high</seg><seg type="columnLine">DuBeque jumped, and in his fear he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">near shooting blindly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With some effort DuBeque stammered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trade vernacular:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me fellow come gammon him fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams. You fellow go me quick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no direct answer for some time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he could hear voices clacking and mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">muring where his remark was evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">being debated. The delay and suspense</seg><seg type="columnLine">came near to stiffening DuBeque's hair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The impulse to drop the lantern and run</seg><seg type="columnLine">was strong, and the cold sweat stood on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as on the body of one dead from fright,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he succeeded not only in standing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground but in calling out:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You fellows like-quick* No plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voices grew a lit tie more loud. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crunch of sand, and out of the darkness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pandanus bushes shapes moved toward him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DuBeque lifted his lantern to get a look.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three stalwart native^, not Solomon Island-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, approached, and each carried a rifle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was a little unusual, more so than one</seg><seg type="columnLine">might think when rifles are the chief desire of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a native toward a trader. But the tropic</seg><seg type="columnLine">rust, particularly in the wet Solomons, soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduces the uncared for rifle to such a state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of junk that even the native throws it away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course, it is alwa)^ evil spirits that ruin</seg><seg type="columnLine">the precious rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me go with you," said one who spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">English after a fashion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?" DuBeque asked as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutinized the handsome face--handsome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is, for a native.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Banoo."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Banoo strode off, leading the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams sat in his hut with the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn. It was drawn not for protection or</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of peering eyes but somewhat to shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the insects that would swarm and fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger-deep about the light, flap themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the pages of t he book he was reading and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawl over his body with irritating slowness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The book he read was a book of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing, a sort of amplified log, not of ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventures and what he saw, but a thing full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nautical findings, of winds and depths and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tides and sightings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Banoo scratched on the door and spoke;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Williams slipped it back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Banoo told him that this lone man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come off the Bebe to talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you want?'' Williams asked be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore Banoo had finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The question came out like the uneven</seg><seg type="columnLine">volley of a squad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">129</seg><seg type="columnLine">DUBEQUE stepped closer, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the square of light that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern, hung from the hut rafter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot through the doorway. The lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he carried had made only a pool of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light about his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then DuBeque lied as with all of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">practise he had never lied before. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not choose his words with care but spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that fluent earnestness that is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing to truth-tellers, who are not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprized that some people will deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">misstate facts but elaborately relate false</seg><seg type="columnLine">details.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DuBeque began by saying "that boy Gil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bert" had got himself into trouble. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard that Willerby was no friend of yours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams, and said that he was not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">either.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm one of Willerby's managers, Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams, and he has often been angry at you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thinks you've interfered with his traders</seg><seg type="columnLine">and recruiters before now, but down deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man's had to admire you. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">often heard him say so. He is a good deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fighter himself. Especially in his younger</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, and, whenever he has thought you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have hurt his pocketbook--why, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has been furious. But, when that fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilbert came on board and said he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Hurricane Williams was an outlaw and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pirate and that Willerby wanted him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he, Gilbert, would be glad to point out</seg><seg type="columnLine">your hut so a party could sneak up and grab</seg><seg type="columnLine">you--why, Williams, W. W. very nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramped the deck in. He was that mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He just tore around, and I got this--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicating his blackened face--"by stepping</seg><seg type="columnLine">in between them when he was swinging on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fellow Gilbert. W. W.'s a big man, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fellow's nothing but a boy, and I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">W. W. 'd be sorry--he always is--if he hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy. But the idea of anybody suggest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing such a thing to him made him clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy. He sent me over here to tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. Gilbert's praying the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't put him ashore, and the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't have him on the ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams listened closely. His body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff and rigid, his eyes agleam. Out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterness of experience with his fellow men</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw no reason for doubting that Gilbert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lang had done precisely as DuBeque said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boy had never concealed dislike for him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that afternoon he had undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">been frightened by having Williams sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize him with Uala. Treachery was what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams expected from all men, all white</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones. He had thought Gilbert Lang dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy was different from most men, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in them all was the streak of treachery. So,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he might believe what was reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill of Gilbert Lang, he saw no reason for ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepting what was reported gallant of Wins-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton Willerby. He had never met WTillerby,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he had met men who told of Willerby's</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything but gallant threats toward him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that all you have to say?" Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked through a strained throat, though his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was not loud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, yes," DuBeque replied, surprized,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disconcerted, "about all-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Then go to-!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those words came slowly, deliberately, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if .definitely ridding himself of DuBeque,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby and Gilbert Lang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams turned abruptly to the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sat down, his back toward the door out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of which stood DuBeque and Banoo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Williams," DuBeque protested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely knowing what he would say next</seg><seg type="columnLine">but determined to say something, anything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might possibly get through the baffling</seg><seg type="columnLine">reserve of this man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " B u t,'Wil liams, " he repea t ed,speaking very</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnestly, for he was in earnest,"I knew how</seg><seg type="columnLine">you feel about that boy, and I don't blame</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. I know the chance of you and Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lerby ever really being friends is too remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">to suggest. I know you don't care what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby or anybody else that trades or re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruits thinks of you--" the words were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing easier now; DuBeque could see a clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">course of argument--"but here is a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you to meet Willerby, and you can tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him just what his traders and blackbirders do</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. He doesn't believe the reports, Williams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've all hinted at the way they rob</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kidnap, but it makes him furious, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he simply doesn't believe it. And, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be honest with you, all of us are afraid to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the cold truth. You are not. And, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told you before, the old man admires you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You should hear the w^ay he makes fun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces of the officers that go poking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about in gunboats trying to locate you. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, that's only if none of his traders or</seg><seg type="columnLine">captains have recently had a run-in with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. W. W.'s a queer old fellow, Williams,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he has a big heart. He wants to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. He sent me over here to ask you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come aboard this evening. You can see, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came alone."</seg><seg type="columnLine">130</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last sentence was the most eloquent</seg><seg type="columnLine">(hat DuBeque had said. It left to plain in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference much that no amount of words could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made so effective.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Hurricane Williams was, for reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own, an exile. He had taken up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lived entirely among those who are called</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages because their society, cast of mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and values--hut more especially their na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kedness--differ from those of the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominant nations. He hated white men</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an intensity that could not have en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dured without being perpetually nourished</seg><seg type="columnLine">by memories. Yet tlie roots of his being ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">too deeply into the white race, which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">borne him and his fathers, to be torn out</seg><seg type="columnLine">even by all the strength and fierceness with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had tom at them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His conscience was clear. It was sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterness that made him hate liis race, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew, though he might try not to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge it within his own thoughts, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were men other than the treacherous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dishonest, brutal, sneaking fellows it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">bis fortune to have always encountered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilbert Lang had seemed such a one. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a surprize, but scarcely a disappoint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, to hear that he was not. However, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a surprize to hear what he had of Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lerby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not feel enraged toward Gilbert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lang. When a man has been disappointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">oft in much the same way, he ceases to feel a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of injury against any one in particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar but holds a grudge against the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">class, as the misogynist, misanthrope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anglophobe--or, as in Williams'case, against</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wheeled on DuBeque with the words:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll go--as you came. Alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the inextinguishable hope, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire that could not be tramped out or dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened by water, lifted a tiny flame. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby was such a man as DuBeque had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DuBeque did not know it, but he had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">battered features, swollen lips and eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">largely to thank for his success. One glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his normal face and Williams would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">distrusted him. As it *as, Williams did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">really believe him. He simply did not en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely doubt him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams went as he was; that is, naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for trousers cut off above the knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unarmed except for a sheath-knife with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanyard to it which he could slip over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist. He wore the knife because it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">handy in the brush or water; if occasion re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired, it might serve to rip a shark. Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams was as much at his ease in Lhe water</seg><seg type="columnLine">as any native, and those of die coast are</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically amphibious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked swiftly along the street, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">DuBeque was hard put to keep up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and, though he spoke from time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, Williams did not answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not only Banoo but a group of armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives joined him on the way and followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the end of the jetty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before he got into the boat, Williams said</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to Banoo that the white men did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand, but one of the blade boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the oars heard and shivered. He chanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a Samoan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams dropped lightly into the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sat down. DuBeque followed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to shove off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Grogan," said DuBeque, too pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">with himself to keep quiet, "this is Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">GROGAN was embarrassed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no use for DuBeque. He won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered if Williams could be the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumor made him out, since DuBeque had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him so easily. DuBeque had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that as an introduction--at least W'il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams took no notice of it--but rather a</seg><seg type="columnLine">veiled wav of gloating. However, Grogan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being of that rough class among whom an</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduction invariably implies a hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake, put out his hand and took it back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams stared at him but said nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Grogan is one of our officers,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">DuBeque hurried on explanatorially and ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently a little afraid that he had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the French call a faux pas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DuBeque did not intend to conceal from</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody that he had cajoled Williams into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trap. He was proud of that. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite sure that even Willerby would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">approve of the mamier in which it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">done if he knew of it That was really the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief reason DuBeque had dared to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. Willerby would be furious to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, even to serve his ends, it had been said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he ever admired Williams or would</seg><seg type="columnLine">treat him otherwise than contemptuously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">DuBeque was something of an adept at</seg><seg type="columnLine">judging men. He had unerringly, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">might almost say instinctively, made about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only possible appeal to Williams that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have been effective.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">131</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams said nothing. Perhaps he sensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trap. It would not have been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time that he walked into danger, fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspecting all that was to come and</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently both unsuspicious and unpro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nightly gaiety on the Bebe floated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunken laughter and sportive cries to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat that was slowly approaching, and shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ows glided and drifted under the brilliantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted awning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Grogan?" called a heavy voice in a kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of subdued tone as the boat drew near.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yez, soir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is DuBeque with you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm here," DuBeque called loudly, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so is Williams!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jackson said something loud but indis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinct--something like an oath of surprize</seg><seg type="columnLine">that struggled out in spite of himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams scrambled up the ladder swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a monkey runs up a vine. Less rapidly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but helped by eagerness, DuBeque came</seg><seg type="columnLine">after.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Grogan put his hand to the ladder, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Samoan sailor spoke to him, and the mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped to listen in amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Williams?" said the loud-voiced Jackson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams stopped, and his eyes flashed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson's bearded face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't remember me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Williams gruffly, abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just as well," Jackson replied. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never hold a grudge 'gainst a better man</seg><seg type="columnLine">than me." Then, lowering his face, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added swifdy: "I don't know why you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. But look out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Jackson turned with a cheerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting to give DuBeque a hand over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">freeboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, Skipper, wan woird wid yez,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grogan called up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, Grogan?" Jackson answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oi'll bay r-right up," and Grogan came</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, and Jackson waited. But DuBeque and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams had gone aft at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the poop there was that noise which</seg><seg type="columnLine">passes for gaiety. The seven or eight peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple who made up Willerby's guests were</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinking and dancing. Existence on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bebe would have been intolerable without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elixir of heady wine, not so much be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause they loved the wine--though they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, too--as because of the insufferable</seg><seg type="columnLine">ennui which only the inspiriting grape</seg><seg type="columnLine">would cause to vanish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DuBeque flung himself up the poop lad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, followed by Williams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, W. W.," DuBeque called shrilly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">elated, "here's Williams!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment those words seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">smother the Lips of all who heard: the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick silence of surprize, and no movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the turning of heads and craning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">necks. Then all edged nearer, gaping vul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture-eyed to look upon the man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost become a legend in the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed to fill the part that rumor gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him: naked, fierce-eyed, short-bearded, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair unevenly, carelessly cut short. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood firm-footed, legs apart, like a statue of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronze. Every muscle was tense, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, though not huge, or even big, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnarled with the knotted muscles which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were supple and smooth enough in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">quieter moods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was hedged about. The women, low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">waisted, in flimsy gowns of rainbowed silk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaped tipsily, and the men in those gro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tesque attitudes of surprize and drunken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness stared through frog-lidded eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with mouths dropped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Willerby, drunk but scarcely show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing itr, for like a barrel--the more solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">when filled--he seemed physically im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pervious to wine in any quantity, roughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoved his way through. And on his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">came Lania, forgetting the pose of tipsiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was nightly assumed to account for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glasses she managed to pour overboard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inside the circle she slipped from his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stepped back, crowding against those</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind her, sensing danger, seeing it, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes were clear, in that bronzed body</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stood as if cast from molten metal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">convey Lhe great artist's idea of a dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">man at bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such refinement of perception was denied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fume-blurred eyes about her, for Du</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beque was as drunk with pride as any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other man with wine, and Jackson, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly come up the ladder, was some dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance away and at Williams' back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willerby swelled out, planted both hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his hips and glared. The great mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment w'as at hand. His sycophants were</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him, waiting to listen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, before Willerby spoke, Williams did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been long ago, or long as time is</seg><seg type="columnLine">valued in such a crisis, disillusioned. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was hard and cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's that boy?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">132</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something resembling a shock was felt by</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who stood around. Here was not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner but a challenger!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Willerby raised his voice and said slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as insolently as he could--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is where you will be - quick--</seg><seg type="columnLine">in irons!" Then he continued, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">quavering rhetorically, like a poor actor in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big scene, for, though he was not acting, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sj&gt;eaking to the ears of the gallery gods</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his poop as much as to Williams. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed the man, spoke of the yardarm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemp, mentioned "white cannibals.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only once did Williams take his gleaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes from Willerby's face. He shifted them</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a barely preccptible instant as if to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark the place where DuBeque stood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willerby at length paused for breath, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams spoke again. It was as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not heard anything that had been said</seg><seg type="columnLine">except the first sentence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''In chains--why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams' questions were like grappling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooks that jerked out answers by sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because he's a friend of yours! Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">else do you suppose? I offered to make his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune," Willerby went on in a slightly ag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grieved voice as a missionary might say he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tried to save an unregenerate sinner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">''but--" the wine perhaps was a little con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusing to brain though not to his legs--"he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me to go to-! And I'll send him</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, and you with him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    THEN IT happened as men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">know of him say it always hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened with Williams. As the hurri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cane strikes with scarcely a warning for</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who are not watchf ul, Williams struck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He half wheeled; an arm flashed out;</seg><seg type="columnLine">DuBeque was down unconscious for min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes and sickened for days to come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cries, shouts, screams. A roar of "kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">him" from Willerby throwm to the ship at</seg><seg type="columnLine">large but more or less directly at the burly</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of Jackson. Yells from amidships.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Women and men on the poop, fearful yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinated, screamed and jostled but did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn away their faces, and some drunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands half clutched at Williams as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounded back from where DuBeque lay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lania glided to one side. Only she and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams were silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams glanced quickly to right and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left; then he rushed straight into the huge fist</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Willerby, taking a glancing blow on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck and going on right up against him. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, steel-fingered, closed on Willerby's</seg><seg type="columnLine">f ull throat, and a blow like the drive of a pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton smashed into his face. He dropped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A swift backward glance over his shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Williams wheeled to meet Jackson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Jackson stopped. Jackson was no cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard, but lor one thing his heart was not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fight. He had plenty of sins on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, but the gospel of fair-play was at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly ingrained within him. * Besides, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had once been at grips with Williams; be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, still further, sailors were swarming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from forecastle and amidships, and Grogan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coming up the poop ladder. Perhaps a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little influence from all those things caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson to stop. He began to talk about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and raised his hand in a kind of repress-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, soothing gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've got you. Williams. There's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">use making more trouble. Here come-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half smile seemed to appear on Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams lips. It may have been that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely parted them in a strained way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">suck his lungs full of air. Anyway, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted toward the top of poop ladder. Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coming. Sheer numbers would pile</seg><seg type="columnLine">him down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and lunged aft. Those in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way were too surprized and slow to get clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his road, and a man and a woman were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowled over as ten-pins fly from the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ball. The little blonde crazily clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">out at him. With drunken luck her fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped into the waistband of his trousers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tightened. Williams scarcely looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around: a back-handed blow and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">free and her beauty was spoiled for a month.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he leaped. Between taffrail and</seg><seg type="columnLine">awning he dived and into the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A rush to the rail, shouting and pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to where the phosphorescent water like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail of fire-sparks marked his course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The boat--after him--kill him!" Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lerby shouted hoarsely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His throat was painfully wrenched. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">windpipe seemed to have been almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked out. and. as he came unsteadily to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, he felt as if the ship were swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swaying in an oily sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell that lugger to lower away, too,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby shouted again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Voices screamed across the water toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lugger that lay nearest. But Jackson</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone, and his was the only voice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would carry easily now that Willerby's was</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked down to hoarseness, and the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">133</seg><seg type="columnLine">men on board the lugger were slow to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">order into their ears or through their heads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boat alongside was delayed a little in</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting away. Rifles were fetched. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was found to be overcrowded, and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crew were sent up, leaving just</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to man the oars, excepting Jackson</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Grogan. A white sailor steered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams was a fast swimmer, but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred and fifty yards to go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boat swung out clear of the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grogan and Jackson fired. The mark was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not visible, only the phosphorescent wake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swimmer, and the bullets striking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water--unless an almost spent ricochet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarely leave even a passing flashing of water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, after they fired, the phosphorescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail vanished; the water disturbed in swim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming smoothed out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-, did we get him!" Jackson ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oi shot hoigh," said Grogan, and both</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked back a little apprehensively toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bebe, where cheering and compliments</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from over the rail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the cheering died, and shouts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look!" "There!" rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the water betrayed Williams after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long dive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jackson and Grogan shot again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again Wiliams dived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lugger had lowered away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-them!" said Jackson, glancing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the reinforcements as shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">began from that boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams was swimming fast, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dives were long. But oars bent in the water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the boats gained and gained. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was little chance of hitting him until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boats were almost on top of him, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be there before he could reach shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then from the water and through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupped hands as he treaded it, Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted one word twice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Banoo! Banoo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shore suddenly seemed alive with</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages. Yells and howls, the fire of rifles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently the streaks of phosphorescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">wakes as the canoes took to the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All Gopassa was on the beach. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">Banoo and those with him had heard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen when Williams left with DuBeque had</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly been repeated, and all the Sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moans, Tongans and Gopassans had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach, where they had squatted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked wonderingly, awaiting the dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pursuers were abruptly turned into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pursued, and the boats went about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made for the ships as fast as the frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">oarsmen could take them. Both boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired and in earnest, but little harm could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done in the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The water was alive with canoes and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if all the fiends of hell were on it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howls and yells of derision, taunts, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung from the distance, the lessening dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, as the canoes swept on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there broke from the Bebe a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash and roar. The old brass camion split</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cup of heaven, and its echoes crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid cliffs and hills: It had never failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">intimidate natives, and there was mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentarily a quiet and hush when its thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering echoes died away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But shouts rose. The shouts were from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Banoo, Nauma and Chief Ghorki calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">their warriors home, for Williams had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up and had told them to go back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach. The shouts set the howling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yells loose again. The canoes turned beach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward with much the reluctance that children</seg><seg type="columnLine">show in leaving a street-fight. and cries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">derision at the "white" boats for fleeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the natives a sense of victory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're lucky," said Jackson in a throaty</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper to Grogan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grogan loosened a big, big sigh of relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some thick profanity, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The old man wouldn't believe it; so we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might as well say nothin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "R-r-right," said Grogan as he put out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to steady himself against the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bebe as the boat came alongside the ladder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Samoan sailor who had overheard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams speak to Banoo had told Grogan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Grogan had told Jackson, and they,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being men who had often crossed Williams'</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail, did not doubt that the sailor had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">right when he claimed that Williams had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to the savages on the jetty--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I don't come back, blow up their ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">at dawm!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">VII</seg><seg type="columnLine">WILLERBY- held a council of war.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A number of things were decided.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He decided them. The others ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiesced, no matter what secret misgivings</seg><seg type="columnLine">they may have had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First, however, everybody wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know of DuBeque how on earth he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to get Hurricane Williams on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board the Bebe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">134</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the moment DuBeque considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his broken jaw providential. Then some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one suggested lhat he write it out. Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ueque was really very miserable. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not feel like writing. One of the men, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely sober at the time, who claimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have been a medical student in liis youth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took DuBeque in band, wrenched the jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">painfully in locating the break, swathed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in bandages and, making a "straw"</seg><seg type="columnLine">oi oiled paper, let him suck down a drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thereupon DuBeque wrote that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone ashore with the intention of putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gun to Williams' head and ordering him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come along, but Williams had asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the boy, Gilbert, and DuBeque had</seg><seg type="columnLine">scud he had been put in irons. Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">was angry about that, but DuBeque had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he had better tell his troubles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby. Williams said he would go right</seg><seg type="columnLine">on board and do that very thing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">DuBeque had replied that it was just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well because he, DuBeque, had come after</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for the purpose of taking him back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without trouble if possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What? Send but one man after me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams had exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not? You are only one man,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">DuBeque had said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'll go," said Williams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus it all happened according to</seg><seg type="columnLine">DuBeque.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That wras an adroit and plausible ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation and seemed, in its essential</seg><seg type="columnLine">features, true, but some of those who read</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wondered what would have happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">had DuBeque not been lucky enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find Williams in a humor for coming, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few were inclined to think that DuBeque</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been braver than they suspected in</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking the chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Willerby proceeded with his council</seg><seg type="columnLine">of war..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hurricane Williams was to be wiped off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somewhere near in one of the many</seg><seg type="columnLine">bays and islets he had his ship. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be captured, li would in a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve as an indemnity for the trouble of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiping him off the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Gopassans must be stirred up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make trouble for him and his natives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What shell and pearls he had obtained</seg><seg type="columnLine">must l^e apprehended, as they were more</seg><seg type="columnLine">or less anyhow the personal property of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby--or, at least, such was his feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But all of those w^ere incidental to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sale and sure move contemplated. A Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man gunboat, the Print, was some two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred miles away at Shortland Island.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby knew the officers well, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked hjm--or, rather, had liked his wine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends. With that far-sightedness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">always characterizes the successful man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of business, Willerby had foreseen that</seg><seg type="columnLine">German influence would be strong enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get a portion of the South Seas, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to keep on the agreeable side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Germans. In other words, he foresaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coming agreement that would put some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the smaller islands and Bougainville</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the Kaiser's protectorate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Prinz was now at Shortland making</seg><seg type="columnLine">surveys of the little island, Morgusaia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that methodical exactitude which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germans use in picking up the crums</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped by empire-grabbing nations. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhaustive survey and charting would add</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'eight to German claims in the South Seas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The capture of Williams would also be</seg><seg type="columnLine">very agreeable to the Prinz, and the Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans would remember the favor Willerby</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So it was decided that the next morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the larger lugger should take on fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, get aboard a few of the best sailors</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Bebt and slip dowm the coast to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Prinz.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The next morning it was raining--as usual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Willerby and his friends lay late abed--</seg><seg type="columnLine">as usual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grogan went on board the lugger as</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper and found her in need of refilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-casks. One way to fill them was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to the stream that flowed dowm to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay from around the east side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">village. Another was to spread canvas</seg><seg type="columnLine">and catch the rain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willerby awoke in an irritable mood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For one thing, his throat was more painful</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever. Instead of a glass of raw</seg><seg type="columnLine">brandy poured down by way of letting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stomach know he was up, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">compelled to sip a hot toddy. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on deck and found the rain. He w'as tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rain. It seemed to him that not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Noah had endured so much rain. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mood for ripping somebody up for</seg><seg type="columnLine">something. But the poop had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">been washed down and the brass work</seg><seg type="columnLine">shined. There were no raffle about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything looked shipshape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only a man who has looked for trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">135</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows how irritating'it is to find things in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order. He looked out at the lugger. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't she got under weigh hours ago?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And what on earth were they doing?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Catching rain-water when a fresh water</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream was in plain sight. He would show</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, he would! He sent for his speaking-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trumpet, but at the first shout through it</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was reminded of Williams' fingers. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">did nothing to relieve his temper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ordered the boat manned, and over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lugger he went. His voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather hoarse, and it was not easy to speak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afraid of the natives, was Grogan? Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the name of all that was profane and</seg><seg type="columnLine">much that was obscene, no niggers should</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever have the satisfaction of knowing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winston Willerby was afraid of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Empty those casks that had already been</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled, and overboard with the string of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would send a guard along. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">do better than that; he would send presents,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. Here was a chance to make friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the natives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To hear him tell of it, one would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that Grogan had been deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to cheat Winston Willerby of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity of making friends with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives, and, having more or less stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to the idea, he began to make the filling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the kegs a great occasion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Willerby went back to the Bebe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trade goods were broken out, bottles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheap whisky brought up, rifles taken from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their oiled rags.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bottle of whisky in one hand and a rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the other: thus does the civilized white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man ever meet the savage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The native village was sleepy. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been up the night before. Besides, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">raining.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      AND at dawn, long before it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">BPgd time to get up, particularly after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">late vigil, Baraka came into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, prancing and yowling. True, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had first gone to the hut of Williams to</seg><seg type="columnLine">consult concerning affairs of magic, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams was gone. But the sun-maker</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been effective the day before; so why</seg><seg type="columnLine">not again? Barak$ knew that his fees and</seg><seg type="columnLine">promises of pay for sun would not be forth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming if he did not make it stay out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonable length of time. True "enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could easily have found a way to put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame on the villagers themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were a thousand little infractions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tabu that could always be invoked as</seg><seg type="columnLine">having spoiled the delicate charms of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil-devil man. But Baraka, no matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">what lack of faith he may have had in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own wizardry, put implicit confidence in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange box that Williams had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. So he went early into the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung his child's toy and made magic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it rained harder and harder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baraka was an old man, and he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the exertion. Moreover, he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the rain. It came in torrents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had committed himself so far that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not stop without rendering his village</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little skeptical. True, he could think up</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanations, but explanations had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">convincing. And there were some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tongans, for instance, who did not believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his magic. They made slighting re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks. Their influence was bad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By eleven o'clock Baraka was pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">much disgusted. The rain swept down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheets. It was a cold, chilling rain, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he saw the boats coming for shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and towing the water-casks. He was sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prized. Other natives were surprized.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here was something to be watched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked over. There was a flurry of excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in the village. Were they coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attack? Should they be attacked?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither Williams nor Banoo could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found. Nauma had been given no in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structions concerning such an emergency,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by nature he was--as most Samoans</seg><seg type="columnLine">are--peaceable without being cowardly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Tongans are somewhat the same, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the Tongans are much more ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight than any other peaceable folk. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps one of the reasons is that they do it</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceedingly well. But the Gopassans were</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much in doubt as to what to do, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moreover, Baraka, who held "peace" or</seg><seg type="columnLine">"war" in any one of the gourds he cared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">peep into, remembered the amazing wealth</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been showered on him the after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon before by the generous Jackson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In some respects the native is much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody else. His appetite for wealth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he is at all avaricious, as devil-devil men</seg><seg type="columnLine">always are, grows by what it is fed on. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other respects the native is exceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly peculiar. He buys children to raise</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his own from the bushmen with whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has an inveterate feud, yet bushmen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women come into the coastal marts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">purchase salt and--if they eat it--fish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">136</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In some places fish are regarded with as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much repugnance by bushmen as human</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh by Eurojjeans. If a party of natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">board a trading-ship and one of them is killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">while trying on his own initiative to murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trader, the others are likely as not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go on bartering as if nothing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. Such incidents have occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and again. The unfortunate native</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspired to win distinction and failed. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his own lookout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it may be seen that their attitudes</seg><seg type="columnLine">may not be judged by white men's logic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anti in this respect it may not be amiss to</seg><seg type="columnLine">here mention the obscure sentence tucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in a little-known book that has con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributed enormously to the success of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">British Empire. In his Majesty's "Hints</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Young Officers on Out Stations," it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">specifically pointed out that natives are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not "inferior" to white men but merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">different.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Out of his long experience with natives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby knew that they were just about</seg><seg type="columnLine">as likely to greet him in a trading spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">as with clubs. Nobody had been killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night before; there was nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have engendered a special feeling of bitter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. He rather expected that Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make trouble, but that was a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had to take if he wished to make trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Williams. And he had come prepared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the day his white men were easily the</seg><seg type="columnLine">superiors of the blacks as rifle-shots, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moreover he was in a way protected from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship by the brass cannon, the roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which carried much farther than its missile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He did not head for the jetty but for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, and the boats came stern-on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore and waited. For some minutes not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a native appeared, though everybody knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bush was full of them. Whether they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to announce their presence with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">volley followed by howls or would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipping forward timidly with coconuts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chickens for trade, was to be seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently a native edged into sight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood waiting. He took that more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">risky method of finding out whether or not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white men would shoot at him. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson stood up and greeted him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouts of welcome and waved a bottle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky to show friendliness. Other natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out. They were urged to come closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">but were hesitant. They were unarmed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which meant that they had left their arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bush some ten or twenty feet away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Jackson and W'illerby climbs out and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">started wading up the beach. Behind them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rifles were held just below the gunwales,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ready in an instant to fire if needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Jackson and Willerby carried whisky,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tobacco and fish-hooks. They came up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the sand and waited, holding out pres-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ents but insisting that the natives come for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them. An animal-trainer requires less pa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tience than a irader. The. natives stood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and looked, now would take a step forward,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">now retreat two, now squat, then stand,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">walk three or four paces nearer, stop, go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">backward and sit down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Both white men swore feelingly, but they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knew it was part of the game and so wore</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their friendliest smiles and never ceased</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gestures of welcome and generosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And it rained, rained, rained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then Baraka came out. He showed that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he remembered Jackson, called to him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and stood looking hungrily toward the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bottle that Jackson carried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Hi, old boy, you fellow come catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">him? Jackson shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You no catch'em for shippy?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baraka, inquiring whether or not Jackson</seg><seg type="columnLine">was after labor recruits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Baraka himself stood in no fear of being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nabbed by a blackbirder. He was too old.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But the others were much disturbed about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that. And long ago both Baraka and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Chief Ghorki had forgotten what Williams</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had said about there being trouble if the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">natives welcomed the Bebe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No, no," Jackson expostulated. "Him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">missionary shippy," waving a broad hand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">toward the Bebe. "No catch 'em black boys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Give whiky, temback--plenty whiky."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was nothing incongruous to native</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">minds in that. Gopassans knew of mission-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aries only by the vaguest reports. Good</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">people, but foolish. Throughout the South</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Seas the missionaries are called foolish,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">even when influential. The Samoan word</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for missionary is "afoolaAnd mission-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aries w'ere often--perhaps are yet--im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">personated by blackbirders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Come catch him," Jackson finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ''Him," "fellow," "plenty," "catch" and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"quick," aided by pantomime, pretty well</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dispenses with all interpreters. The na-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tives readily leam fragments of English;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they will under pressure leam a little of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"oui cmi'' as they call French, but it is as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if there were a taboo on all German</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">words. They will not or can not leam them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">137</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baraka came forward carrying his child's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Here, old boy, get a little o' this m you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Jackson, opening the bottle and hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it to Baraka, who promptly drank long</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deep, coughing and spluttering over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiery liquor but delighted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Other of the natives edged closer. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottles were opened. Tobacco was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributed. Fish-hooks were handed around.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A new supply of gifts was brought from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat. The natives were thick about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come to shippy--any time--plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiky," said the generous Willerby as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed out gifts with both hands. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">no Williams, no Williams boys. No. Bad!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The unutterable "badness" of Williams</seg><seg type="columnLine">was conveyed by Willerby's face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestures rather than by liis words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That a he!" said a shrill voice, high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched in rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jackson and Willerby looked around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a beautiful native girl, poised in anger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing her dark eyes upon them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WILLERBY had been long in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropics. He had seen hundreds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of native girls and been</seg><seg type="columnLine">susceptible to the charms of many. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that moment he thought Uala the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful of any he had ever seen. It wras</seg><seg type="columnLine">nol true perhaps. Beauty, like other things</seg><seg type="columnLine">that have superlatives, is comparative, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lithe Samoan belle was resplendent</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the flat-featured women of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solomons--blacker of skin than the Poly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesians and often, even when not in mourn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, plastered with lime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh ho!" said Willerby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whew!" Jackson commented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That a lie!" Uala repeated. "Misser</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams good man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Full o' fire!" said Willerby admiringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fie cast about for some present that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be agreeable to feminine vanity, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he looked up, Uala was gone. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had disobeyed Nauma by going within</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking-distance of the Bebe men, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the story she carried to his ears somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">palliated the offense: Bebe men were making</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gopassans fool drunk and telling them</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams was bad man; much trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come sure, and she hoped yaws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cramps, bad dreams and sharks would get</seg><seg type="columnLine">every last one of the Gopassans!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willerby did not lose sight of his main</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose: to poison the natives with whisky</seg><seg type="columnLine">and words; also to find out what he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Williams, where his ship was and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything else of the kind that might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">of value. But, familiar with native lore, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not forget Uala when he added pay to</seg><seg type="columnLine">generosity to get Baraka to make him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">love-charm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In no place in the world, as among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solomons, are love or any other charms so</seg><seg type="columnLine">effective. Let a native know' that a witch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor has prepared a "ghost-shooler"</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him, and that native will die. Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman see a love-charm, made with devil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil magic, in the hands of a suitor, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she be the wife of a chief, she will</seg><seg type="columnLine">yield. What the chief may afterward do</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her, to her lover or, if a bold chief, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wizard, is none of her concern. She would</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more think of resisting the charm than</seg><seg type="columnLine">of entering a tambu house. It simply is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not done, and that is all there is to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willerby's big red face beamed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure as the natives grew drunk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisy. He began to have hopes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams might be killed--scuppered--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward that end gave broad hints, together</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pledges of valuable friendship. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well pleased with his work and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baraka well pleased with his attentions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He made sport of the child's rattle, told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him Williams had given him a "woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">toy" as an insult to the great devil-devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits and, truthfully enough, tliat it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not possibly affect the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No. Willerby promised to give Baraka</seg><seg type="columnLine">information concerning the weather from</seg><seg type="columnLine">day to day and not to insult the devil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil spirits by presents of a "woman's toy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Baraka was to make a love-charm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">give it to Uala, telling her that she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not resist the affection of Willerby. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not usual for the wizard to have the suitor</seg><seg type="columnLine">present the charm by proxy, but Willerby</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought in this instance it was advisable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not care to remain until Baraka</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sober enough to dabble with the magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his gourds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The casks were filled, the full supply of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gifts distributed, and Willerby and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">party returned to the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Willerby came on deck, flushed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased, he was met by Lania, who, clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed and fresh, carefully dressed, was alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the awning, waiting. He forgot all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the dusky Uala. Lania was incom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parable, and she then showed a spirit, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivacity which Willerby could not see was</seg><seg type="columnLine">138</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced but which had been markedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacking in her for some time. If Lania</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done as she wished, she would have gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her couch and wept: she was torn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">liarassed as she had never been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No woman is ever her real self--or dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plays it--except in intense anger. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wears robe over robe, herself unaware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the number that clothe her nakedness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sometimes in the ecstasy of her first love</seg><seg type="columnLine">she will very nearly bare her soul, but for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her second and third, and after, she is dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guised as an actress. And Lania was old</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ways of the world, and like all</seg><seg type="columnLine">women who are--being more so than even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tender, wide-eyed maidens--she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart-hungry. But, being cynical-minded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing men and women, too, she was, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought she was, wholly disillusioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Disillusionment, often as not, merely sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitutes one illusion for another. She hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby; she hated Paul DuBeque; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated all whom she knew. She thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was love--deep, passionate, binding</seg><seg type="columnLine">love--she wanted: love that would anguish</seg><seg type="columnLine">her with intense delights. Women know</seg><seg type="columnLine">and always have known what psycho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logists have only lately revealed to men:</seg><seg type="columnLine">that delight is edged with pain. Women</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the more passionate; and "passion," as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the etymologists will tell all who ask means</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally "a state of suffering." Lania</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted love that would hurt; "true love"</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is called often by women who merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">misname "novelty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Women have so many various textured</seg><seg type="columnLine">and colored vestments about their naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">desires that not even in sincerest moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">can they distinguish between what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to conjure to them and what they really</seg><seg type="columnLine">want.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lania had been loved. She could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember the times her face had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted by men whose passions for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned them up. She had never loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">Willerby. At times she liked him, yes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he was an investment, and the pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">got from his company was that of being his</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorite, of wearing the black pearl ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rings, of seeing other women envious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But other men had struck fire from her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clive Stanley--at any hour of night or day</seg><seg type="columnLine">that name streaked across her brain, Lania</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt something grip her flesh. Whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">else may have caused that sensation, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fear, too. She had loved him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming pa'ssion--and grown tired in time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She always grew tired. But Clive Stanley</seg><seg type="columnLine">--she had told him how she hated her</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband; how he abused her, mistreated</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. And Stanley, the strangest man she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever known, brilliant, wealthy, bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the world, had swept her into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and carried her off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, before he tarried her, he made sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the husband would not follow.. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs of justice had followed instead. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught Clive Stanley and hanged him for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder of her husband. They had hanged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. There was no doubt of that. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was still afraid of him, afraid that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was alive. There had been something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the man that precluded the idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death touching him. It was all rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague and superstitious, but it troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">her dreams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also there had been within easy remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brance Ballantyne, the son of the English</seg><seg type="columnLine">lord: that affair was only a matter of days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense and ending in violence. Always</seg><seg type="columnLine">something violent seemed to attend her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He died. She fled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">yTHEN more recently there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">another man. She had tried to,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than did, love him. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">told herself that she loved; perhaps all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her life she would think that she really had:</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least she was grateful to his memory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been from the world of gentlemen:</seg><seg type="columnLine">not of titles and registered blood, but of--</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no other word to convey it--gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Though a man of some years and</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling, he had been innocent to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one can tell enough about a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">by looking at her, by talking to her, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking kisses from her mouth and--all</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a few weeks, to make her his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lania had married him--but not until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paul had assured her that there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough reasons for believing him wealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take the chance. There were times</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she really thought that she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have married him anyway. But Paul, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devil's advocate with the book of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">life under his arm. stood ever behind her</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to read her shame aloud and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">destructively than the horns of Jericho</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered any wall with which love--"un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">profitable" love--tried to hedge her about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had gone with her husband, pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his affection and joy rather than de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted by her own. The feeling of security</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">139</seg><seg type="columnLine">and comfort charmed her at first, but, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sailor who has scarcely slept ashore after</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding out a typhoon before he grows weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">of land's solid footing, so she wished that</seg><seg type="columnLine">life might be a little more lively than placid</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinners, the quiet, reserved conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of callers, the boredom of dull theaters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She knew she did not belong among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people to whom her husband had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">her--and that they knew it, no matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">how little they might show it. And, too, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew aweary of her husband's satisfaction in</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon-gazing and the quiet words and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleness of his love-making.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul grew more weary than she of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions. He proposed a hideous relief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With combined fright and repugnance she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had rebelled. But he had only to threaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the book of her life, and she grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet. She did not agree; she simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">became impassive--then it was more with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that instinctive impulse to flee which</seg><seg type="columnLine">possesses all persons who have seen a wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, taken even ever so passive a part in it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">than with relief and desire to be gone, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she fled again to the vast seclusion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Seas and to Willerby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ever since her return she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">inwardly discontented, more so than ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. Willerby was, so to speak, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearable^-and Paul DuBeque more so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She wished to be well rid of them all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no way out. Money was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacking, but it was in Paul's hands. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">foresighted prodigality he had seen to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her wardrobe was all she wished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there was nothing beyond that. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was yet young, full of life's hot energies;</seg><seg type="columnLine">also, heart-hungry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she had first laid her eyes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilbert Lang, seen his clean, almost beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful boyish face, the gentlemanly though</seg><seg type="columnLine">youthful poise of him, vague things stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">within her. The harder she stared at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the less he seemed to resemble any one she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had met. He seemed so far from wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">he belonged--so astray and alone among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men one met around the islands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something about him fascinated her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reminiscent of something--she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not remember what. She had not taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes from his face, and the whole of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night she had scarcely taken her thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him--and, when she did, it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think of Williams the berserker, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently closely connected with the boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She feared that Paul DuBeque would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitate to stick a knife into the boy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she knew very well that Willerby could</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily find a wav to have him dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">overboard. But Paul was very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned with his broken jaw, and Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lerby, too, at the moment had other matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning Paul stayed in bed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Most of the others did, too. They sipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee and rum on awakening and dozed</seg><seg type="columnLine">off again. Anything to put in the time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill it. W'hen they awoke again, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had another drink, and, when well saturated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rum. they would get up. Lania, bored</seg><seg type="columnLine">as any, but more far-sighted, endured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intolerable confinement of ship life without</seg><seg type="columnLine">recourse to stimulants in any such quan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tities. She arose to a bath and a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes of deep breathing, scrutinized her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face for wrinkles and plucked at the flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">under her chin to see how distant was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmare of the fleshy throat. She wasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much time in one way or another as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others did in bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she came on deck, Willerby and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boats had gone ashore. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors left but the while boatswain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two or three natives to man the brass</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannon in case it was needed. As usual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing to do. There were some</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minerva Press novels scattered about, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few paper-backed French stories, but Lania</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not care for reading. Fiction bored</seg><seg type="columnLine">"her, and anything else was not always in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligible. Also as usual it was raining.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lania stood about for some minutes; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she hastened for the steward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where, she asked carelessly as one might</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquire for anything out of idle curiosity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that boy?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was in one of the storerooms, irons on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet. Yes, the steward had the key.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why had he been put there? The steward</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know. Grogan had told him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy was to be kept there and the door was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be kept locked. Certainly she could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The steward liked Lania. Most men did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was beautiful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN Lania stood in the opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, Gilbert Lang sat on the deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head dejectedly propped against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands. About him were boxes and bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rels. He had been given nothing to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hardness of the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not look up until he heard her</seg><seg type="columnLine">140</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice saying to the steward that she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be all right and that she would lock the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door when she left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbert Lang remembered her. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sort of a woman that is always remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered: black-haired, black-eyed * a slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">oval face, long lashes and red lips; also</seg><seg type="columnLine">what might be called a multitude of hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, glossy and fine. Vain as they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the glory, wom£n will never realize fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they begin clipping it how much of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feminine distinction is due to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. There never was, there never could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, a clipped-headed sorceress. Lania's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair, had she worn it down, would have hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">in massive braids, and it was only by adroit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and studied arrangement that she escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">a top-heavy appearance and made her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair literally a crowning glory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbert Lang with some difficulty got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You poor boy!" she said, unaffectedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are they going to do with me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know. They are brutes!" She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not posing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have they caught Mr. Williams?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, hardly! He--" she stopped. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing at him intently--"Would you do</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Willerby asked if he would turn you</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head slowly, and he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her with something of disappointment in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes, as much as to say--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is why you came!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wouldn't? Not ii they were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hurt you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You said he was no friend of yours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You said it two or three times."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He isn't what could be called a friend.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He hardly ever spoke to me. And some</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he seemed always angry. It made</seg><seg type="columnLine">me very uncomfortable, though I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is only his manner. He hates white men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I am beginning to understand why!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did he hate you?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know. He seemed to at times.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I suppose he does--now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbert Lang was thinking of how Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liams had glared at him when he came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uala and him under the palms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't any one tell you what happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What happened? No. T didn't hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything. Did they get him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Lania told of how Williams had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come on board the Bebe--and left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He must be a wonder I" Gilbert Lang</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed admiringly, for Lania had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any way minimized Williams' blows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men call him a hurricane. How did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to be with him, Mr. Gilbert?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Lang," he corrected. "Gilbert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lang."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it was as if lightning had struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lania. By the flash of the bolt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned her she saw what it was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilbert Lang that had stirred vague things</seg><seg type="columnLine">within her. They were no longer vague.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The heart-hungriness that had seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull her toward him was rather the hungri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and memory of his brother, Frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lang. This boy was her brother by law,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the name of Gilbert, as "that kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother of mine," had often been on Frank's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was scarcely a family resemblance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Gilbert was the more delicate, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was much suggestive of his mother.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lania had sought him out largely through</seg><seg type="columnLine">restlessness and not through passion, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">within her w'as the feeling that she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">love him. Except for a certain untar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nished youth, it w^s not because of Gilbert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lang's personality, but because of her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">discontent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw that she was very much agitated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he asked w'hat was the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hers was a quick brain:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I overheard Willerby and Paul say they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to put Lang out of the way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kill him. I didn't know that was your</seg><seg type="columnLine">name! I thought it was Gilbert. Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 won't let them kill you! I won't!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fire flashed in Lania's eves; her body</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffened. She meant it. Of course, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had overheard nothing of the kind, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while she had swiftly fabricated that in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation to cover her own agitation, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">nevertheless knew that either Paul Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beque or Winston Willerby would readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough kill the boy. But that did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin to explain her attitude. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that deep, deep feeling of gratitude, amount-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to a tenderness more pervading than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any emotion she had ever called "love,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Gilbert Lang's brother. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gentleman, and, though his presence was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes wearisome, the memory of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his devotion, courtesy, worshipful inno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cence, was dear to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In retrospect she appreciated him, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, his father and mother, and in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">retrospective bitterness at DuBeque for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">141</seg><seg type="columnLine">having robbed her of those things--much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more precious viewed from the tedious deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Bebe than when they had been within</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers' reach--she neglected to remember,</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly forgot and would have denied, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been guiltily acquiescent in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder. True, there had been the book</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her life from which DuBeque threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to read, but, had she loved Frank Lang or</seg><seg type="columnLine">been another kind of woman, she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have dared the harpies, given herself over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be plucked by scandal and cast out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have saved him from the poison which</seg><seg type="columnLine">DuBeque--her cousin, not her brother as</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been pretended under the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown--had managed to procure against</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency from an old devil-doctor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Santa Cruzians--the most artful of South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sea poisoners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It did not at once occur to her why</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilbert Lang was in the South Seas. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that did bear in upon her was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this boy should not be harmed. Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all reasoning the matter out--women</seg><seg type="columnLine">seldom reason anything out--she flamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with resolution. It was as if in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague, chaotic way she would try to atone</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the wrong done his brother. But she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no clear idea of doing that; she did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even think of it. Perhaps it might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that she felt it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What women feel and what they think</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not necessarily have a logical con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nection. The enigmatic quality in them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">intuition, that so baffles the male is like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magic catpels of Arabian wizards and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carries them instantly from point to point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," asked Gilbert Lang simply but</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced, "should they want to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because they are that kind of men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You hit Paul. That is reason enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. And that Paul wants to do it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason enough for Willerby." And she very</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly voiced the wish, which was sincere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Williams had killed both!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But look how they treated me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you swim?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know how you can get away</seg><seg type="columnLine">then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bui may not Williams make them give</seg><seg type="columnLine">me up? I feel awfully for saying I was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend of his and-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He can do nothing. If he comes any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where near the ship, they will kill him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But surely men don't commit murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that? Isn't there any law? Nothing?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was of himself as much as Williams that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was thinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Solomons are not like Philadelphia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilbert Lang! War-ships make the laws--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Willerby tells the officers what is right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what is wrong, and he usually keeps</seg><seg type="columnLine">them so drunk that they believe him!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How did you know I came from Phila-</seg><seg type="columnLine">delphia?" he exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a perilous slip, but she did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitate:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Williams said so. I don't remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">just how, but he mentioned it in some way."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't think I ever told him where my</seg><seg type="columnLine">home-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must have," she said definitely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Listen, I am going to bring you a revolver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If anybody tries to hurt you, shoot! I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">see if it can be arranged so you can get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away."</seg><seg type="columnLine">GILBERT LANG did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to say. He was in the posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of believing her while feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was unbelievable that anybody should</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to kill him. He was grateful to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">but surprized at her intensity: she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stranger to him, yet there was a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">indefinable intimacy about her, a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">intimate familiarity, which, combined with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her peculiarly vivid beauty, added some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to his feeling of depression. Gilbert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lang was not cast in the heroic mold;</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever courage he may have had was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the sort that made him a man of easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventures, and he had none of the facile</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallantry that carries men along dashingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with strange women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thanked her, but she seemed scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear "him. She went away and came back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a revolver, loaded. Lania gave it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, urging him not to hesitate in using it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had some difficulty in not venturing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into dangerous questions. It flashed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her as strange that Gilbert Lang should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the South Seas, yet she rejected the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had come to search her out. First,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did not think it likely that she and</seg><seg type="columnLine">DuBeque had been tracked westward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and also, being unable to imagine how little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilbert Lang had known of the South Seas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could not believe that he had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">into them, their myriad islands and great</seg><seg type="columnLine">distances, to look for her and DuBeque.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did ask why a boy such as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">' 41'-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">• 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ay</seg><seg type="columnLine">I42</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gilbert Lang answered evasively even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he looked at her, wanting to say some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of how his ironed ankles and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger from Willerby seemed merely the</seg><seg type="columnLine">persistence of the tragedy that had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his family.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And she in turn could hardly repress the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of "Alice Blown," thinking of how</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could pretend to have known "Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown" and to have remembered "Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown's" mentioning a Philadelphian fam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily of Langs. But common sense restrained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She left after urging him again not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitate to use the revolver if he saw he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in danger. Nothing had been said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that let him know DuBeque was in any way</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied to her by blood; nothing tliat had</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed to him her name. She seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very wonderful woman. But, in thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her, he thought of Uala, and to think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two at once was in a degree to compare</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, not critically, not appraisingly but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one might set side by side to view at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">some piece of earthwork out of Tuscany</seg><seg type="columnLine">and porcelain out of Limoges. He flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at remembrance of Uala, yet the charm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her was evoked by the flush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Lania had left him, she went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the poop to await the return of Willerby.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was very agitated and perturbed, know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing scarcely what to do--in fact, scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing what to hope for. Then the devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust a thought into her brain that thrilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and frightened: supposing Paul DuBeque</seg><seg type="columnLine">were artfully egged on to remember his</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat against the boy and the boy killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him! It would be the fate he deserved</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she w'ould be rid of DuBeque's spectral' /</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinister shadow. She did not decide upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">it but nursed the thought tentatively, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.came to seem less revolting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She soon regarded it as less of her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">planning than that of Nemesis, of justice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those seeking desired ends through violence</seg><seg type="columnLine">always manage with more or less sincerity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put the full responsibility to God,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Destiny or the abstraction, Justice. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is as if something innate within most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mankind shrinks from murder, until--</seg><seg type="columnLine">as savages with their own hands make</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous images which can only be</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied with an altar-heap of dripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads--they have created some idea that</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only sanctions the killing but often</seg><seg type="columnLine">commands it: vengeance, by the avenger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway, is always looked upon as an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked headsman who wears the insignia</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Justice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lania never gave such matters as these</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a trace of thought, but by the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychological processes just mentioned she</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at the feeling that it w'ould be right</seg><seg type="columnLine">for DuBeque to die by the hand of Gilbert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so almost resolved, thrilled, appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing vivacious, but agitated, she stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting the coming of Willerby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he came proud and boastful.

S.</seg><seg type="columnLine">&amp; T. railroad, had the reputa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of being an obstinate man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one difficult to persuade from any view</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his own, and it was said of him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he never forgot anything, good or bad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This being the case, it is not strange that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should keep in mind the first dereliction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Andy Peck, agent at Belham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was in the Spring of the year 1916</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Superintendent Carrick started out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the general manager and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">general superintendents and a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">other officials of high and low degree on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip of inspection. They came to Belham</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their special train and found the station</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked and the agent absent. They waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fussed around for the better part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten minutes, the general manager and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other high officials casting coldly question-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing glances at the fuming Carrick and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiring of one another--in distantly om-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inous voices that they made certain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">luckless superintendent would hear--what</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of a doings was this? But no agent</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, and the inspection of the Belham</seg><seg type="columnLine">station was abandoned. The special rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with its indignant passengers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You may be sure that a subsequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigation came. Oh, yes! And this</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigation brought out the' fact that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while tie high and mighty members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">•inspection party were wasting a precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten minutes in vain waiting for Andy Peck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">,lDan Kurrie's Inning," elc.</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come and let them in so they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a look-see, said Andy was calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched out on the chair in a barber-shop</seg><seg type="columnLine">several minutes walk distant from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depot, receiving certain tonsorial atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You kept us waiting for that!" stormed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carrick. "Kept us waiting while you got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shave and a hair-cut!''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And a shampoo," corrected young Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with proper humility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His face was perfectly sober, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">inwardly he was feeling somehow mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased with himself. For this, you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand, was before he had met Ina,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the miller's daughter, and learned responsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the most outrageous thing I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of!" gasped the superintendent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glaring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Business was slack," murmured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wicked Andy. "And I didn't know you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coming." He sighed. "If \rou'd only</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent me word."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carrick glared some more. Send word,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed--and spoil the very purpose of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll see!'' he cried and pounded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of the desk. "We'll lay vou off for</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty days for this offense! And mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">this: if ever again I find you absent from</seg><seg type="columnLine">your office when you should be on duty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll discharge you completely!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Andy got his thirty days. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't care--enjoyed the enforced vacation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">144	Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact. In those thirty days he got properly</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquainted with the folks of Belham</seg><seg type="columnLine">town--to which he hail but shortly come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, best of all, he met black-eyed Ina,</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter of Duncan, the miller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The more he met Ina the more Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">became convinced that this Belham job</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just the thing for him. And, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days passed, Ina came to agree with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So, by the fime Summer had gone and early</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fall had come, things between them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty well settled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's Lane's little bungalow," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said one evening. "It'll be empty the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">of November."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--" she hesitated, coloring prettily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Set the day," he insisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--yes, all right!" She placed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on his arm. "Just give me a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two to decide, Andy," she said--just</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT the very next afternoon Super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">intendent Carrick dropped off a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly moving freight as it passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Belham depot. He tried the waiting-room</seg><seg type="columnLine">door; it was unlocked, and he entered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tried the office door; it was locked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rattled the knob of the office door</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigorously. No response. He peered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the glass of the closed ticket</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. No one in sight. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside and peered through the front office</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, where he had a complete view of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior. No person was within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, ha!" said Carrick and went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the silent waiting-room and seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half-hour passed. No agent. Forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five minutes. Still no agent. The super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">intendent rose, stumped out of the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started to walk down the track.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On a short siding just west of the station</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood six camp-cars, the quarters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the steel gang, at present la\*ing</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel rail near Belham, and all colored--</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought from the South during the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">Summer. As Carrick was passing one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cars, he heard voices speaking behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">its closed door. He paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don' know, Mistuh Agent," said one</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaker. " 'Steamboat,' he say-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you listen to Steamboat," cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the unmistakable voice of Agent Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peck. "You listen to me. I'm telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">you the truth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carrick waited for no more. He shoved</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that door open with a bang. Seated on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of a wooden bunk were two colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">men--one with a bandaged foot, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a wrapped-up hand. On a soap-box</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite them sat Andy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is this where you spend your time now?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Carrick grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The agent looked a little dismayed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I can explain--" he began.	•</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come out here," interrupted the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">intendent. "I've something to say to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The agent descended from the car and</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed Carrick. Out of earshot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big-eyed colored men the superintendent</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and faced Peck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You remember what I told you last</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring," he said firmiy to the agent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You ve been absent from your office for</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least forty-five minutes this afternoon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know, because I was at the station waiting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're done--fired."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you ought to let me explain,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">remonstrated Andy. "I was working for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interests of the R. S. &amp; T. when I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that camp-car just now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Likely!'' scoffed Carrick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peck flushed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," jje affirmed steadily. "These</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel gang boys are threatening to quit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back South. They're worrying about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coming Winter up North here--afraid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they stay, they'll freeze. One of the gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">is egging the others to go--a fellow they</seg><seg type="columnLine">call Steamboat Jackson. I've been trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to queer his efforts and persuade them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay; that's why I was talking to those two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men when you came."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carrick listened incredulously until Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished his tale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bosh!" he snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the truth," declared Andy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He kept his mind fixed on Ina and thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able to choke back the hot words</seg><seg type="columnLine">that surged to his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No matter," said Carrick shortly. &lt;fI</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't believe they'll leave--and, even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they should, it's none of your affair. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">business was to stay in your office and take</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of tilings there. Anyhow, you re</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. I'll have a man here in a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">days to relieve you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andy saw it was useless to talk any fur- v</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther to the headstrong superintendent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very good," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning on his heel, he walked toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the depot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agent Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">145</seg><seg type="columnLine">n</seg><seg type="columnLine">yIT WAS that very Thursday eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning that Track Supervisor Quinn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the maintenance-of-way depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, entered the superintendent's office</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Wharton, division headquarters, twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles east of Belham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," said Quinn to Carrick</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly, "but I'm afraid our colored steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang is not going to stick with us. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there's a nip of frost in these Fall morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, they're getting restless; their thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">are turning back to their sunny South."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carrick looked up quickly. Recollection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what Agent Peck had said that afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed through his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You think so?" he said, frowning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," returned 'Quinn. "They've an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exaggerated idea of the severity of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northern Winter. That's one trouble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And another is that they're continually</seg><seg type="columnLine">being stirred up by the more shiftless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">restless spirits among them--by one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Steamboat, especially. If we only</seg><seg type="columnLine">could discreetly eliminate both troubles!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More confirmation of what Peck had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. Carrick's face grew more dour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But no difference, he decided; Relief Agent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manott had already been instructed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieve Peck the coming Monday. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway, these agents ought to learn their</seg><seg type="columnLine">place; Peck had not been called on to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand with the steel gang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That agent at Belham was saying some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing along the same line," he observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud, however.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Andy Peck," said Quinn. "Yes, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows. Good boy; been trying to keep 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight. It will be little less than a calamity</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us if we can't hold them," he went on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now that practically all the foreigners</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone back to the old countries to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the big mix-up over there--and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who didn't have entered the mills</seg><seg type="columnLine">and factories--our last reserve, our last</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope, is the colored labor from the South.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've said yourself that we absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">must get this new rail laid to stand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy traffic that's coming this Winter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">next ^ Spring. The old steel that we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">replacing is done for, as you know. If we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be compelled to try to make it stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">up under the demand that will be made</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it, we're going to be left in a sad</seg><seg type="columnLine">state."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carrick knew that this was sober truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">10</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he refused to be convinced that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel gang situation was serious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's probably just talk," he said. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't believe they'll actually go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid of it," persisted Quinn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"However, I believe that, if we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">eliminate the uneasy element that keeps</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others in a state of unrest, we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm their fears about the coming cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather. But the eliminating would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be done in a most diplomatic manner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The whole gang is at the skittish point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to jump at the first move that looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious to them. If we fire one and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes, the entire crowd goes. That's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way I figure it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Carrick, "what are you going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do about it?" It was plain that he still</seg><seg type="columnLine">was skeptical about the supervisor's fears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm stumped," said Quinn glumly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm worried sick about the whole busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness." He walked toward the door. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm expecting there'll be some sort of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crisis within the next few days, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, bother!" said Carrick. "It's prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably nothing. But, if you really are</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarmed, do whatever you think best."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I would," said Quinn, "if I only knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was best. I'm trying to think up</seg><seg type="columnLine">something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">m</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE steel gang was holding forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the far edge of the station</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform, gathered in a ring at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the circle of light made by the single</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform lamp there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The early October moon tipped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastern hills. The evening still was warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the balmy windless day. By morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colored men might be shivering under</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Frost's caress, but tonight their hearts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were light. The reason was simple. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming Saturday, less than forty-eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours away, would be pay-day. So now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this Thursday evening, by turns they</seg><seg type="columnLine">clogged, buck-and-winging with fantastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grotesque shufflings of the feet, the on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookers applauding with boisterously en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiastic cries. At frequent intervals their</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices rose in song--wonderfully har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monious, vibrate with natural melody.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andy Peck, having nothing much to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">just then but wait until the last evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger-train, No. 73&lt;should arrive, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">146</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Lhe waiting-room doorway and for a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispiritedly watched the merrymaking down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the far end of tlie freight house. lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly was feeling blue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER supper he had stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in at Duncan's before returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Lhe station. Ina had met him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Lhe door. By his expression she imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately perceived that he brought bad news.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our wedding is off--for a while!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurted out. "i've been fired."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Andy!" she faltered. "How? Why?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Into her sympathetic ears he quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured his sad tale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The nasty old thing!" she said in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignantly when he had finished. "I'd just</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to get my fingers in his hair a minute;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd shake some sense into him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is indicative of Andy's extreme misery</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he did not even smile at that--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">superintendenl's crown being so devoid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair that it would have been impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get anything approximating a grasp of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was looking at Lane's bungalow, too,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she continued. "Just this afternoon. -It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">---it's the dearest little house." She put</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face close to his. "Couldn't we--</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't we be married anyway, Andy?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We could," he replied, "but we won't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not till I get a job."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You could find one afterward," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll find one first," he had answered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forthwith he had lorn himself away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For, despite his firmness, he felt himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakening, and that, he felt, was a poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiling to do under the circumstances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN CONSEQUENCE Andy now</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooded in the doorway of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">station while he contemplaled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel gang. Presently he strolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them, found a spike keg</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying near the side of the freight house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">up-ended it and sat down just outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle of light. One "Memphis Joe" was</seg><seg type="columnLine">performing at the time.

"So</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, if Steamboat goes back soon, it looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">like his blow was no good?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure do!

A quick glance in that direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion revealed to him that the sound was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made by Supervisor Quinn's motor speeder</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it swiftly drew nearer the station.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steamboat quickly decided it might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">best not to let the supervisor see him lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the depot instead of being out</seg><seg type="columnLine">laying rails with the rest of the steel gang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not that Steamboat cared much--but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would save useless talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At once the colored man rose and slunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">around to the back of the depot building,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it being too late for him to regain the shelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the string of camp-cars that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel gang used. He paused near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear window of the agent's little office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The supervisor's speeder drew up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">station and stopped. Stepping off,,• Quinn</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted the wheels from the rails and rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speeder back from the tracks. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he entered the station, going into the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Andy Peck sat at his desk, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleting his daily accounts. As the after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon was rather warm, the agent had</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly raised the rear office window for</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventilation. The voices of Peck and Quinn</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried out clearly to the squatting Steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Andy!" said Quinn. "How're</seg><seg type="columnLine">things today?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor," responded the agent. "Rotten!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was so different from the usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">blithe Andy's speech that the supervisor</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared in surprize.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why?" he exclaimed. "What's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Been canned," jerked out Andy. "Yes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terday--by the right honorable Mr. Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rick. Am waiting now for the relief man;</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect he'll get here about Monday."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tell me about it," pressed Quinn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peck did. When he was through, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supervisor whistled softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The dickens!" he said. ^He was silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment. "Of course, I can't say much--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you know how I feel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks," replied Andy. "But let's talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">about something else. What's on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own mind today?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trouble, too," said Quinn. "Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but trouble. I'm trying to fix a way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get these steel gangers to stick with us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Foreman Walsh tells me there's open talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the men that most of them are going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave right after they get their pay to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow. It's that Steamboat fellow who's</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodding them to it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know they're nervous," said Andy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"As 1 told the old man yesterday, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in that camp-car doing a little pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paganda stuff. But he couldn't see it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understand," said Quinn warmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I appreciate what you've done, even if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't." He paused. "If we could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">eliminate that Steamboat without scaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others off, I believe we could hold 'em.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just now it looks as if his influence over</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was great enough to get them to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he wants. But, if we could get rid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him in the right way or could overcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">his influence in some manner, I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd stay here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">148</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you anything in mind?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I have a little scheme," answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinn, "but I'll admit I have my doubts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its success. Anyway, that's my chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for coming to see you today."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's hear about it," urged Andy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's just this. We're going to try a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little psychology on the steel gangers--</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to pay them in cash tomorrow instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of with the usual checks. A bunch of bills</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a colored man's hand looks a lot bigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him than a little slip of paper, even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paper is worth as much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," said Peck. "You're figuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, when a man sees all that ready cash</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his fist and realizes that he can get as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more every two weeks if he stays on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the job. he's not going to be so ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave right off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly," stated the supervisor. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see for yourself, though, that it's not</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to base our hopes on. But we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to give it a trial."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How you going to pay them?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's where you come in," answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinn. "We're going to send a special pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll out to you and let you do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how about the money?" questioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy. "Where's it to come from?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this question the attentive Steamboat</seg><seg type="columnLine">pricked up his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That'll come with the pay-roll sheets,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied Quinn. His words reached Steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat distinctly. "Sheets and money will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done up in a package and will reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">you tonight on No. 73. That'll give you</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance to go over it and get things</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined up befefre the men call tomorrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. The money will be in bills--</seg><seg type="columnLine">about three thousand dollars."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sort of gentle sigh escaped Steamboat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three thousand dollars! Many, many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times the amount that would keep him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort, in luxury, over Winter. To-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow he'd draw around forty dollars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That forty dollars, plus seven dollars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty cents--the latter amount almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly the result of a recent lucky session</seg><seg type="columnLine">at craps--represented his total assets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steamboat sighed deeply again. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars! He hearkened once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the conversation within the office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," Agent Peck was saying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let it come. I'll do my best--even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man has given me the can. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't any safe here, though, to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money in overnight. And there's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank in town."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take it home with you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," objected Andy. "That'd throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">me responsible if the stuff should dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was silence for a moment. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinn spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "in that case, then, I expect the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to do will be to conceal it some</seg><seg type="columnLine">place here in the office. It ought to be safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, especially as no one else needs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know it's here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It ought to be," assented Andy. "Any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, that's what I'll have to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, it'll be all right," said Quinn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He walked toward the door. "Well, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to be moving along. Hasn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">any trouble since last pay-day, has there?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men behaving?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No; no trouble since," replied Andy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The colored boys are doing as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be expected, I guess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just what did happen last time?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quinn. "I never did hear precisely, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've been wanting to ask you. Trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the townfollc, wasn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. A few of the steel gangers got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little too much gin and made some excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment up-town. 1 wasn't there myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the next day I heard there'd been</seg><seg type="columnLine">threats made. Some of the white folks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were for coming down here and cleaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the camp-cars. I heard they claimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd do it if the colored men started</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the deuce of it--when they get</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little booze!" said Quinn. "Well, let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust they'll behave. But, if anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">should break loose, you wire to head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters, and we'll get some of our raiJroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">cops out here quick. A man can't fool with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sort of thing. No telling."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," responded Andy. "But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess there's not much danger. Mostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot air, I expect."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hope so," said the supervisor. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't take any chances. So long. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop in tomorrow and see how things are</seg><seg type="columnLine">working out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      V</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WrAS shortly after dark Friday</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening when Andy Peck stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the end of the station to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the baggage truck there and pull it out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front, ready for No. 73's arrival. Loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agent Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">149</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter and singing came from most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp-cars that stood on the siding west</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the station. The car that stood nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the depot was that wherein Steamboat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson and some of his special cronies</seg><seg type="columnLine">abode. Andy paused and listened for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments. From this last car came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loudest of the sounds--and the sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were neither those of laughter nor singing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">High, declamatory voices sounded there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the words that floated out were plenti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully besprinkled with oaths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A voice came from the rear comer of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">station, close at hand/</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mistuh Agent!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes?" answered Andy. The voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though low-pitched, was unmistakably that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Memphis Joe. "What is it, Memphis?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Step over close here, please. I don'</seg><seg type="columnLine">want none them other steel gangers see me</seg><seg type="columnLine">talkin' to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wondering, Andy moved over into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom of the corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter, Memphis?".</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mistuh Agent, I don' like the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Steamboat man is actin'!"

"But</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you think they'll really try it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Memphis spoke with conviction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They got lot o' gin in 'em," he declared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"An' some colored folks li'ble do most</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything w'en they gits the booze.

"Goin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">make big trouble for lot o' us colored folks</seg><seg type="columnLine">whut don' want no trouble.

First</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing we know there'll be a race war on!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, suh, that's jest whut I figger.

Liable</seg><seg type="columnLine">15°</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a battle on between them and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">townfolk if things are not stopped."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The devil!" said the dispatcher, plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused. "Stick there a few minutes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">111 call you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peck waited impatiently. It was five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes before the dispatcher called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain Caney of our police force was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still in his office," spelled Potts. "He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering up several of his men, and they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave here on a special, likely a light engine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside of ten or fifteen minutes. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">means they should get to Belham inside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty-five minutes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Good!" said Andy. "They'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We got hold of Superintendent Carrick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Supervisor Quinn, too. They'll be on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the special. No actual trouble yet, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peck held the key open a few seconds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So Carrick was coming. He wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the superintendent still considered what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steel gang did as none of his--Andy's--</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair. He thought of Ina and his spoiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">wedding-day, and his jaw set grimly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he came, the old man better not say</seg><seg type="columnLine">much, or he might hear something.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tapped the key again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he said to Potts, "but it's liable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to break soon, judging by the signs. Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em to hit the ball."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They sure will. Hold the gang down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you can, till they come and keep me</seg><seg type="columnLine">posted as much as possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will," promised Andy. "Good-by--</seg><seg type="columnLine">here comes 73."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dashed out of the station as the train</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew in and pulled his truck up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">express-car door. Several small boxes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">express matter were unloaded, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the messenger handed Peck a sealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">package.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's a package the W'harton people</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me to be sure to get to you tonight,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the man in the express-car. "Sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andy signed the messenger's book, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the train departed. lie ran the truck</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the station, dumped the boxes into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wareroom and then reentered the office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sealed package under his arm. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, he knew, the package containing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay-roll sheets and the money with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steel gang was to be paid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Andy entered the office, an unseen</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of eager eyes, outside, watched him</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely through the rear office window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The furtive, glistening eyes saw the agent</seg><seg type="columnLine">place the package on his desk and examine</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for a moment. But the agent's next move</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not so pleasing. Stepping to the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the office, Peck pulled down the shades</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two windows there and then moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the one rear window and pulled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The silent watcher in the darkness outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved back as Peck approached the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, and he muttered in disappointment</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the blind was lowered. Fortune, though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to favor him, for near the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a small slit in the worn, thread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare shade. Quickly the watcher applied</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eye opposite the slit. He muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumphantly; he could see in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shades drawn, Peck approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stationery cupboard that stood against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall at one side of the office, opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doors of it and from a shelf took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stack of large envelopes. Next he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sealed package, shoved it to the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shelf and replaced the envelopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the)' had been. Then he dosed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupboard doors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That done, Andy glanced at the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock. It had been 8:05 when he talked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dispatcher. It was 8:20 now; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">special should be on its way. He went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the key and called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Has the special started?" he asked Potts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just pulled out.51 answered the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who ran the trains. "Things all right yet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, as far as I know," replied Andy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm going up-town now and see how</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs are developing. Will try to get back</seg><seg type="columnLine">here soon and report."</seg><seg type="columnLine">\T</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     THERE was a perfect buzz of</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement around Scanlon's Hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Andy Peck drew near. The hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on the main street between the post-</seg><seg type="columnLine">office and a general store and was several</seg><seg type="columnLine">squares from the depot. The barroom was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long room at one side of the building.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the street corners near-by different</seg><seg type="columnLine">small groups of Belham citizens stood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking low and seriously and eying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window's of the saloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As Peck approadied the side door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barroom, the door was pushed open from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside and a man went in--Steamboat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy was a little surprized, because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agent Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">151</seg><seg type="columnLine">had supposed that Steamboat and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd were already all within; their camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">car had been dark and silent when he left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the station. He stepped to the door him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, pushed it open an inch or so and put</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eye to the opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standing lined up along one end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar were half a dozen of Steamboat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow steel gangers. Steamboat was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">joining them, and they were greeting him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with noisy sallies. At the other end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar stood "Big" Noonan, an oil-well driller</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Bclham's cock-of-the-walk. Near him</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood five or six other town men, all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them watching the steel gangers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttering to one another, their faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowning, their eyes unfriendly. In back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bar was Scanlon's barkeeper, plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill at ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give us all li'l drink o' gin. white man!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Steamboat to the barkeeper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The words, as he uttered them, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberately offensive. There was a slur</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, an innuendo on the "white man."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The barkeeper hesitated, glancing at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowning faces of Big Noonan and his men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steamboat swaggered closer to the bar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Step 'long, white man!" he said loudly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Whut you 'fraid 'bout?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The barkeeper's face flushed; he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a bottle from the array behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andy tarried no longer at the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He let it swing to, went around to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front and entered the hotel office. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inner room Proprietor Scanlon himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the office as Peck stepped in. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was anxious; its ruddy glow was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade paler than usual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Scanlon!" exclaimed Peck. "Just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man I want. You must refuse to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">those colored men out there any more</seg><seg type="columnLine">booze!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He jerked his thumb toward the door that</seg><seg type="columnLine">led from the office into the barroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scanlon shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd like to, Peck, but I'm more afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">to refuse than to give it to them. They've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been acting ugly ever since they came in."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But they'll only get worse if they keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">on with the stuff!" remonstrated Peck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"First thing you know there'll be a riot</seg><seg type="columnLine">on! Remember how it started before!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know!" exclaimed Scanlon. He threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his hands. "But I can't-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shout interrupted him--a shout that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the barroom. Mingled with it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the crash of breaking glass. Then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar arose, deeper shouts, and the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shattering glass was redoubled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My -!" cried Scanlon. "Listen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andy leaped for the barroom door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung it open, Scanlon close behind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The barroom was filled with the furious</seg><seg type="columnLine">clashing of bodies. All lights save a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">one above the bar were out, smashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits. Fists thrashed about; vigorous, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fane phrases were uttered aloud. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a second something flew through the air;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was another crash--and the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining light vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, boys," called Big Noonan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "Come on, get outside! Everybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">go get his gun! We'll go down and clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">this black camp-car bunch out right!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A yell of approval came from what must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been the white belligerents. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a rush in the darkened room, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer side door burst open. The sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of swiftly moving feet came to the tense</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy and Proprietor Scanlon. Apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steel gangers had followed the Belham</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens out, for the barroom became silent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, before Peck or Scanlon had moved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barkeeper appeared, his face white.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What started it?" demanded Scanlon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seizing the man's shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That nigger--that Steamboat--tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shove Big Noonan aside--and called him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a name!" stumbled the frightened bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper. "Then Noonan landed on him--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they all waded in!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was enough for Andy; he waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear no more. Things, he felt, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving too swiftly for him to control.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He ran out of the office, down the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">popped into a side alley and legged it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the depot. He saw men running; cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried to him. Some of the shouts, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, sounded as if they were coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Steamboat's crowd-defiant cries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He ran his best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was confusion around the camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars as Peck neared the station--high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched chatter, figures flitting in and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the doors. Andy avoided the cars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the depot. Quickly he unlocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waiting-room door, entered and snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lock again behind him, entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office and closed that door also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon leaving, he had turned off all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside station lights. Now he did not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light them. He had raised the shades</seg><seg type="columnLine">before departing, and a platform light just</seg><seg type="columnLine">152</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside shone ihrough the front office</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows, making enough light for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find his way about in the familiar office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He opened the train wire key.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ' She's broke!" he said to the dispatcher.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The fight is on! Started up-town and is</seg><seg type="columnLine">working this way last, lloyv's the special</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's getting along," replied Potts</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. "Ought to show up there inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ten minutes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "If she doesn't do better than that, she's</seg><seg type="columnLine">liable to find nothing but pieces left," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "She's rolling!" assured the dispatcher.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Anybody hurt?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't tell--hope not," answered Peck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He paused as a sudden fusillade of shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang out somewhere up around the camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars. "They're shooting now!" he said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Potts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are!" flashed the dispatcher.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Are you in any danger yourself, boy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guess not," lied Andy, and he smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had heard several things plunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the station right after the volley</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shots. The marksmen were shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and wild and hitting the depot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch yourself," began Potts--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was as far as Andy paid any attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to what the dispatcher was saying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a sudden crash at the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">window of the office. Glass flew in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shower over the office floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hoky!" breathed Andy and at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped to the floor, crouching down in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscurity and protection of the comer at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the telegraph desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several lesser crashes followed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, as if something were being used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to knock out the ragged pieces of glass left</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticking there after the first blow. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a black blur abruptly appeared between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broken sashes, and a figure dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly inside the office. A faint ray of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light from the platform lamp outside fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the intruder's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steamboat Jackson!</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE agent crouched lower in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner, astonished but silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without an instant's delay Steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat moved to the stationery cupboard. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked the doors open, reached in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled out a bunch of big envelopes. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached in again, brought out something</seg><seg type="columnLine">else and laid it on the ledge of the ticket</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, dose beside the aiplward. Dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the office was, the agent knew what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored man had placed on the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge. It was the package of pay-roll</seg><seg type="columnLine">money!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A sort of savage ejaculation of pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the steel gang man as he put</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the package of money. But he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not linger over his rejoicing. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupboard then he quick!) pulled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">envelopes, tissue sheets and various sizes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paper forms. These he pulled apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly and piJed on the floor in a heap</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the corner of the wooden cupboard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was the scratching of a match, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little burst of flame flared up. Steamboat</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached down and touched the flame to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of a sheet of paper in the heap that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steamboat's back, as he stood at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupboard, had been turned to Andy Peck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The agent's amazement at the colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's entrance had only been increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his further surprize at Steamboat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing forth of the money--by his sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize that the man should have knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it and of its hiding-place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, as Steamboat piled the paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor, some flash of explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to Andy--some perception of Steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat's true reason for inciting the riot. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steamboat had started the trouble pay-day</seg><seg type="columnLine">night after receiving his wages, the agent</seg><seg type="columnLine">w-ould not have been so perplexed. Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had wondered, though, why the fellow had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut loose tonight, the night before pay-day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now he knewr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up around the camp-cars the shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">had risen in volume, but so far there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been no repetition of the shooting. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steamboat struck the match and bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. Andy Peck, silent as a cat, rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the balls of liis feet. As the match</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame was touched to the paper, he grabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stout-legged office chair from the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him and swmng it in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You treacherous devil!" cried Andy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the chair down on Steamboat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The blow was true, but the colored man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head also w'as true--to type. The steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganger staggered erect as the swif tlv spread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flame on the floor lit up the office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surprized and slightly bewildered he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his eyes flashed wickedly as he faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agent Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">153</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll tear your heart out!" he roared and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a lunge at Peck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Try it!" invited Andy, swinging his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And this time he didn't aim at the head--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he aimed a smashing sidewise blow at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black man's shins. Steamboat's legs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept from under him like straws. He fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor with a tremendous thump, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">howls filling the office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, name o' God!" he moaned. "Don'</seg><seg type="columnLine">do that! Don' do that no mo', Mistuh</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agent!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Agent Andy, chair poised again, held</seg><seg type="columnLine">back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you be good?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, suli! Yes, suh!" groaned Steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat. "Only jes' don' hit my laigs no mo'!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was an abrupt grinding of brakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in front of the office before Andy could</seg><seg type="columnLine">say mOre and a hissing of steam. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived, the special had arrived--a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine. The waiting-room door flew open</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a crash as stout shoulders were set</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the lock's resistance. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tramping of heavy feet inside. Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung open the office door. Carrick, Quinn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Capt. Caney and three other men swept in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashlights and pistols in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Peck!" cried the superintendent, amazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sight in the office. "What in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil! What's this fire? We saw it through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Peck was all business; he had a plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch that man on the floor!" he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. "Grab him up and make him</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk!" And without further ado he</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched up the office water bucket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed its contents on the burning heap</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paper. The fire by that time had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">licking eagerly at the stationery case.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the water was sufficient; the flames</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly expired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come along! WTe got to hurry!" cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy then. He grabbed up the package</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pay-roll money from the ticket window</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge and thrust it into Quinn's hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hang on to that!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Capt. Caney meanwhile had hauled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">abject Steamboat to his feet. Peck clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colored man's other arm. Pushing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tugging, he started for the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amazed and not comprehending, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed all to recognize .Andy's leadership.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a group they burst out of the station</seg><seg type="columnLine">and headed toward the near-by camp-cars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caney and Peck in the lead, dragging the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reluctant steel ganger between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "W'hat's the idea?" grunted Caney as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stumbled on. "What're you work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait!" panted Andy. &lt;fNot time now</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain. Have to get this thing headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">off before some one gets killed--if some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasn't already been. You just follow my</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead and back me up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moon had come up since Andy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasty return to the office from up-town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealing the camp-cars and surroundings</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly as the party approached. All lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cars were now out, the cars5 occupants</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurking in the obscurity inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the party rounded the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">string of cars, the Belham citizens, gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shadow of a warehouse at the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the siding, apparently mistook them</seg><seg type="columnLine">for charging steel gangers. A shout arose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here they come, boys!" It was Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Noonan's voice. "Out and at them!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a mighty shout in answer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Belliamites leaped out for battle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From Steamboat's darkened car an answer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cry went forth, and some shots flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Andy Peck dropped Steamboat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and jumped ahead of his party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep back, men!" he shouted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oncoming townfolk. "Keep 'em back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Noonan! Everything's all right now!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Belhamites, recognizing Peck's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">and perceiving their mistake as to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party's identity, faltered and came to a halt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only Noonan pressed forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What!" he cried. "That you, Andy?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," replied the agent. "Just hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">your men a minute! I'm going to fix</seg><seg type="columnLine">things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and grasped Steamboat by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell your men in that car to let up!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he commanded sternly. "Tell them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out here, quick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steamboat, overawed, did not demur.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He faced liis car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on out, Geo'ge!" he called de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectedly. "Come on, you an' all the boys!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fo' the lan' sakes, that you, Steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat?" said one in the car, evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">Geo'ge; his head was cautiously sticking</seg><seg type="columnLine">out an open window. "We-aU been won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">d'ring wliar you been!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's me," admitted the gloomy Steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll not be harmed," put in Peck</seg><seg type="columnLine">154</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the men in the car. "And, when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out here, I'll tell you where Steamboat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been."	*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the car next to Steamboat's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice now spoke--Memphis Joe's voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming from the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Am that you, Mistuh Agent?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is," answered Andy. "Get the boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">all out, Memphis, and bring 'em here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nobody'll get hurt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A joyous whoop came from Memphis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a second he and the other men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his car tumbled out, arriving on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as Steamboat's crowd. From other</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars steel gangers did likewise, whooping</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the word spread. They gathered to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether near where Andy, Carrick, Quinn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steamboat, Caney and the other officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood. Quietly now, perceiving that some</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange thing was happening, the Belham</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and Big Noonan edged nearer, lining</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on one side of the agent and his party,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the colored men lined up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"YOU men have been easy marks--</seg><seg type="columnLine">suckers!" said Andy, addressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself particularly to Steamboat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering, rather sheepish-looking half</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen. "Steamboat's been making you</seg><seg type="columnLine">play tricks for him--tricks so he'd get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">good things and you'd get nothing. Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know that, George?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whut you-all mean?" nervously said</seg><seg type="columnLine">George, a tall, rangy buck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, you know how Steamboat's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowing he was going South this Winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a pocketful of money. But he hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">got his pocketful. Today, though, he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have learned some way that I was expecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a package of cash on this evening's train.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He decided that was just the cash he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So he got some booze, managed to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">you fellows worked up and finally got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-looking riot started. Then, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">you men did the fighting, he sneaked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the station, broke in, found the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to set the station on fire. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire would be blamed on the riot, see--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his theft of the money would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered up. But I happened to be in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">station, and Steamboat came to grief!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A stir--as of resentment--was visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the half-dozen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fo' Lawd's sake, Steamboat!" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">George. "Am that right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Sleamboat made no answer. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely hung his head and mumbled un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligibly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, it's right!" declared Andy. "Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him. and you can tell for vourselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, of course, you don't know what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money Steamboat tried to swipe was for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you, George?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, suh," answered George.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'll tell you. It's pay money</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's to be us-ed to pay the steel gang men</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow. That's the kind of man Steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boal is. He was going to take it all, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you fellows wouldn't have got any--not</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow, anyway. You'd have had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait several days longer until another pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll was fixed up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time the wave of resentment that</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept over the steel gang was not confined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the men from Steamboat's car; it went</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the entire crowd, and there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttering of imprecations and threats.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seeing their bad-man subdued, the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gang felt emboldened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Andy had turned away from them</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment. He faced Big Noonan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Belham men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see how it is, Noonan." he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This Steamboat man here is really the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one to blame--and we'll get rid of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He prodded on a few others, for the reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">I just gave. But most of these colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">men didn't want any trouble. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them came to me just before train-time</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight, told me he was afraid Steamboat</seg><seg type="columnLine">was trying to stir up something and asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to do what I could to stop it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd say you did what you could!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">boomed Big Noonan. "You certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurrah for Andy!" called several of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Belham citizens behind Noonan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And three cheers were given; exuberandy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then, to the embarrassed agent's</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion, they were echoed by the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang side. But Agent Andy kept his wits.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He faced the colored men again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And, now that the fuss is over and you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to get your money tomorrow, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad wants all you men to stay!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried. "All but Steamboat. It's he that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been making all the trouble--filling you</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of lies about the cold weather and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to scare you out--just" out of pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">devilishness. You stick with the railroad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they'll see that you're kept warm--</seg><seg type="columnLine">get lots of coal and plenty to eat. Here re</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agent Andy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">155</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big bosses--the superintendent and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supervisor. They'll tell you the same!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Andy turned to the big bosses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How about it, gentlemen?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He looked at Quinn, and then he looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at Carrick. When he looked at Carrick,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Andy's eyes were a little defiant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But the superintendent was not slow to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">respond.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's right!" he affirmed loudly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What the agent said goes. We'll take</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of you! It's a promise! W7ill you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stay?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was a half instant's hesitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then Memphis Joe spoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, suh!" he shouted. "I'se goin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay! We-all goin' stay! WTiat you-all say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">big boys?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He turned to his fellows. And a great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shout of affirmation greeted him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Goin' stay!" roared the steel gang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Goin' stay!"'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That's the stuff!" called Carrick en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thusiastically. "We'D count on you, every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He faced about to where Andy Peck</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood. And then---for the first time in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 ife so far as any man there knew--he openly</seg><seg type="columnLine">confessed to an error.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Son," said Carrick quietly, "I've made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a mistake. I'm just beginning to get an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">idea of what you've done here for us. And,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if I'm not too late, I want to ask you to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">forget what I said the other day--forget it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and stay here on this job. Will you do it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Andy could scarcely believe his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Somehow the possibility of anything like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this had never occurred to him. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the thought swept through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head that here was a most excellent oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to say something that would scorch</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carrick's hide. But consideration of Ina</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knowledge of what his staying would</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean to her and to him checked his tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">--if not a certain sense of whimsicality that</seg><seg type="columnLine">always was lurking at the back of his brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be so pleased!" he murmured.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS somewhat less than ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes after he had given the su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perintendent his answer that Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the residence of Duncan, the miller.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was about to press the bell when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door flew open and Ina came out, appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently bound for somewhere in great haste.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stopped abruptly at sight of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Andy!" she exclaimed.

I was just going out to hunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You needn't now," he said, his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaming.

Above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of a thousand islands is a slight rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ground like a furry tongue protruding</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cavern of the forests, brown with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huts of the village of Basayaguru.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On a hot afternoon, when the only moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">things were the scraggy goats, lazily scratch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, open-beaked native chickens and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chromatic lizards, a faint throb vibrated on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sulky air like the pulse of a distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">drum. A yodeling cry from the steamy</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern of the. forest caused the village to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarm with lithe ebon figures whose heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">were decorated with frizzly hair, built a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot high above the forehead, streaming with</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-bladed spears in their hands, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flood of ants, to a point upon the riverside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again came the cry from the forest from</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the river. The distant throb grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the "Eh! Ahh! Eh! Ahh! Eh! Ahh!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the chant of paddlers. Presently around</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bend appeared a canoe. As the host of</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives squatted in silence, came stalking</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemnly a tall figure with an ivory comb</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a dagger stuck through the head-dress</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hair and carrying an Express rifle. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the midst of his people he sank upon liis</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunches, gazing from a masklike face</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the river with Lhe eyes of a repressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">child. The strange canoe hugged the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank of the river, indicating by neglect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rowers to avoid the sweep of the stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were uncertain of their reception.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amidship of the leading canoe was a hood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of woven grass from which protruded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet of a white man. When the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was immediately opposite the village, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddlers backed water, and a tall man</seg><seg type="columnLine">garbed in w'hite calico with a green turban</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the Arab manner stood up in the bow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chanted rapidly in a loud voice. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mob of natives watching gravely on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach listened in silence. When the stran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger had ceased, one cried back and was again</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered by a chant and a signal made with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right hand raised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately the tall chief with the Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press rifle rose to his feet, cried out imperi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously and sat down.

The chief rose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet as the white approached and raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand, murmuring the Arabic word-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "SdUwmaV*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "SalaarnaJ" responded the white.

During the interview the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's sharp eyes were unobtrusively</seg><seg type="columnLine">noting details. The interpreter informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that the chief had graciously permitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange white man to camp in the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">space of the village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The white recalled the topographical sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings, and after swift reflection he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented, knowing that, except for field clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings in the dense forest, there probably was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other ground suitable for a camp. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters having been arranged, the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">intimated that he would present the cre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dentials to his august father, Basayaguru,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which entailed the presentation of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snider rifle. As the young chief rose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">depart, the white man eyed the Express as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warrior handed it to his superior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> &lt;fNotice that .450, Ali?" he commented</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the interpreter as they continued to sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shade while their equipment was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought from the canoes. "D'you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are any white traders round here?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Allah is all-wise," responded Ali Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammed. "Perhaps the person has traded</seg><seg type="columnLine">it from the South, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "South!" exclaimed the little doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">briskly.

BACK through the village, noting</seg><seg type="columnLine">gjiujg the square hut of Arab influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by a small palisade with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large wild fig in the center, the little doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramped, batting at the myriad flies. As,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perspiring and hot , he plunged into his green</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas chair, his personal boy emerged with</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky and a sparklet siphon.

Advancing to within</seg><seg type="columnLine">three feet of the white man, he squatted</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. His followers placed before him</seg><seg type="columnLine">two elephant tusks of great weight and good</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition. According to the etiquette of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great chief the little doctor pretended</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to notice their presence. For some</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes he continued to smoke his cigar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested in the swelling of the sun as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank within the humid atmosphere above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As silently and abstractedly sat Basa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingu and his ebon retainers. From another</seg><seg type="columnLine">green tent, the replica of the doctor's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged Ali in the green turban and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">green gown and, stalking with much dignity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank upon a stool beside the doctor without</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as a twitch of the eyelid to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge the presence of the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief. In impressed silence the audience</seg><seg type="columnLine">of warriors and boys and children watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the statuesque poses of the actors. At last</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ali gravely permitted his eyes to rest upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basafingu and, turning very slowly, ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served quietly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There appears to be some of the savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing presents for you, Doctor. Probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be as well to observe them now. "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Probably it would," assented the doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor.

Well, tell Yamagulu to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">him whatever you think, Ali, and bundle</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off to bed."	%</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ah's voice raised to summon Yamagulu,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then appeared muffled as if deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">hushed by clammy hands of the air on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which rolled, with the rhythmic certainty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an Atlantic swell, the somber notes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ "What the devil's that drum for, Ali?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired the doctor irritably as he gazed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire, pondering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is designed to prepare the mind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body for the marriage-feast upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">full moon, Doctor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, that's about tomorrow or the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, isn't it?" observed the doctor, glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at the battered moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two nights more yet."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE steamy heat of the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the first conscious impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the doctor was that a pulse was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating in his brain. The mental effort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an automatic medical diagnosis awoke him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the reality of the merciless beat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drum. He swore violently and shouted for</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee. Outside the net the flies had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready taken over the duty of torment from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mosquitoes. The doctor breakfasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on river-fish in an exceedingly bad temper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The inconvenience of the camp-site began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to weaken his resolution to stay even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few days. In the jungle one had not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratch all day as well as all night. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">consulted Ali but as ever merely elicited</seg><seg type="columnLine">the imperturbable, "Allah only knows."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The doctor gulped the quinine he was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">act of swallowing. The brilliant black eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ali in his bronze cameo features regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him coldly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If the doctor would permit himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meditate upon the Occidental and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or-"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Meditate!" spluttered the doctor, covet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the irrefragable composure of the Arab.</seg><seg type="columnLine">*l-it, I believe I've a touch of malaria.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tell Yamagulu to get me the thermometer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his temperature was normal and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse as steady as the drum-throb. Later</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning he persisted in visiting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old chief, Basayaguru, in spite of Airs as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surance that no more information would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">forthcoming. But at any rate an audience</seg><seg type="columnLine">would serve to fill up time. The old man, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">token of his greatness and beauty, was so fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could scarcely walk. He lay like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby hippopotamus upon his skins in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpetual shadows of his square hut and ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to do nothing save eat, drink, snuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sleep, leaving affairs of war and peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his son and politics perforce to Yamala,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the witch-doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To each of the questions put by Ali on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white man's behalf, he merely grunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">non-committally, a process which led one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose that he was innocent of every crime</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as virtue that the black mind could</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceive. The only articulate sentence elic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ited was an order to a slave to send the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white chief another present of a large tusk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ivory. The doctor regarded the tusk in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the meaning of this?" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded of Ali. "We can't possibly make</seg><seg type="columnLine">return presents of anywhere near the value</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these three tusks and the small ones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What do you think he's after? My Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press? Because he won't get that, natu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rally."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Allah only knows."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" The doctor plucked savagely at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his beard. "Ali, I ask what you think,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not what Allah thinks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is impossible to state, Doctor. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have I witnessed such exquisite generosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a native negro."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little doctor returned to the camp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling, as he remarked to Ali, that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something in this confounded country</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would make a saint irritable. And, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">retired beneath the mosquito-net for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">siesta, he grinned at the recollection of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage advice based on theoretical knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had given to clients about to leave for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tropics, to guard against irritation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquor. During the hottest hours, when man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beast and bird, but not woman, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeisance to the sun, the heart-throb of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drum continued mercilessly until the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his sudorific bath struggled with an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse to seize his Express and make an end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tormentor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At about four he suddenly grabbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun and, summoning Yamagulu, decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would seek something upon which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could wreak his exasperation. Yama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulu very naturally protested that neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird nor beast would be stirring before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool of the sinking sun, but the little doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that in such a country to thrust forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason was positively indecent and as in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">congruous as a Socratian debate in a lunatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">asylum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the village not a body stirred. Unno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed they selected the small canoe and em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked. The doctor directed the sullen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yamagulu to paddle down-stream along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank until they should find fairly solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground to land. About half a mile away, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they coasted just outside the guardian</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp, he perceived a narrow passage in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dense reed as if made by canoes. Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">this turgid waterway the doctor insisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon going. Fifty yards' paddling and reed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauling brought them within the line of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great trees and upon fairly solid earth be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the dense jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor and the sullen Yamagulu</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed and tore their way for some dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, earning a bath of sweat in the proc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ess. But this did not deter the doctor, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had obstinately made up his mind that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted distraction from the deadly ennui</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the village. Farther on they struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher ground and came upoD a grove of</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the sulky Yamagulu came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">life and, touching the doctor's arm, pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his spear down the grove. The doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to distinguish anything in the tangle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of grass and bush. Then, just as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to whisper, he detected part of a bush</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed to move. Slowly grew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of some large animaL Calculating for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the region of the heart, the doctor fired. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">convulsive motion of the bush, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped forth a big buck, high in the shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders and dappled like forest light and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the doctor fired. The beast swerved</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right and disappeared. Yamagulu</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced forward. The doctor followed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found him beside the buck. The first shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a fluke; striking the animal in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters as it had turned to flee, the bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lodged in the spine, killing it instantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Okapi!" gasped the exultant doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, as he stoojied, Yamagulu. grinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">delightedly, drew his attention to a broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoor through the dense grass which ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards from the kill was streaked with blood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealing that in all probability the mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">was severely if not mortally wounded. Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citedly the doctor bade Yamagulu to stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">and skin the slain animal and hurried off on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The beast was big and evidently bleeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily; so the spoor was easy to follow even</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a white man. On panted the doctor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgetful, as ever a hunter is, that time after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all is an arbitrary affair. The ground rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily. The going became better at every</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard. Where the trail led through thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush, the beast had already forced a pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage. As the ground sank into a slight val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley, he caught a glimpse of the okapi as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed off from a shelter where it had ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently rested for a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Tree of Life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wiping raining sweat from his eyes, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiastic doctor plugged on down into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bog to his waist, dragged himself up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side and on--and on--and on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">littje man struggled until quite suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail disappeared in a patch of jungle as</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick as a grass mat. The doctor hunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">furiously about--then with more care. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of blood; the blood-trail had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared entirely; not even a broken grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">stem or twig could he find. Perhaps he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had overrun the trail?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He cast about in circles. Fatigued and</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting, he sat down to rest and wipe his</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaming face. Just as he was about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make another effort, it suddenly occurred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that the shadows seemed very dense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He glanced up through the leafy roof. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering ball of the sun was topping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. In a panic he snatched his watch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stared incredulously at the nands point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to a quarter past five. Only another</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-quarters of an hour to sunset.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-!" he muttered disappointedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll have to give him up now. I'll go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and help Yamagulu finish the skinning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A rational and wise decision of the doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor's. He stepped forward briskly, hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated, made a pace and stopped altogether.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He glanced about in a bewildered childlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion at the wall of tree trunks festooned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with creepers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When the devil--what the--oh."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he stared around more incredu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lously. Then very softly he said--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, God!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">HE HAD no more idea of the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion from which he had come than</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the secret of the cult. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatigued. So he sat down again, sagely</seg><seg type="columnLine">concluding that he might as well rest while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought the matter out systematically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes. Systematically; that was the thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. Now where was the sun when they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed the buck? Um. Ah. At first he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sure that it had been over his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder; then as equally positive that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been behind him. Finally he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded that there hadn't been any-sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a few moments the doctor was occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pied in informing himself exactly how many</seg><seg type="columnLine">different kinds of a fool he was; he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought himself of Yamagulu and proceeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to inform the. African continent what par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular species of criminal idiots it pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">163</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced. Then he plucked at his beard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at his watch again. Remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">about forty minutes of daylight--that is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest semi-gloom. Tropical twilight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only thing in Africa in a hurry, decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor bitterly. Then he rose deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minedly and, choosing a direction at ran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom, made the amusing assertion that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would continue in a straight line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within twenty yards he was bogged; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried another direction and found impene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trable thicket; a third attempt found an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other bog. A puzzled wonder as to how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deuce he had ever arrived where he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the confounded jungle was nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp-holes was broken by a brilliant idea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course! He would just fire a few shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would bring the fool Yamagulu to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Accordingly at intervals of half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute he proceeded to carry out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme, which, however, was arrested by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appalling discovery that he only had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">another ten cartridges--with the probability</seg><seg type="columnLine">of spending the night in the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For a while he stood still, trying to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrate upon listening for the expected yell</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the succoring Yamagulu. In a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments he became aware of the voice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest: a continued twittering hum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmurs like lachrymose sighs, tiny squeaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whispers, mysterious rustles, a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">chatter and a harsh squawk, then a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooting. He fired another two cartridges</seg><seg type="columnLine">in rapid succession. The echoes appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">like derisive laughter. A sudden screech</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him made him start convulsively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-!'' he muttered as if afraid to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">too loud lest some one hear. "I need a dose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bromide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gloom appeared to be deepening with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hissing noise as if it were slithering through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaves. Erupted unbidden into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind an exact knowledge of African car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nivora. He glanced questioninglv toward a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree. Images of gorillas and snakes shut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered his eyes swiftly. He grew violently</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry with himself at the discovery that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was searching for things in the darkness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he cursed aloud, as if challenging</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole menagerie of animals, and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">off swiftly straight ahead of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fighting with an impulse to run, strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling to suppress imagination, the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">plowed on, tearing far more desperately</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he realized, through thickets of creep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, tacking beside swamp-holes. Firmly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">persisted in telling himself his exact medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">164</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition. The forest appeared to over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear his thoughts and to laugh in rustling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeping, insidious chuckles. Against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">will he pulled out his watch repeatedly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">peer at it in the gloom. Then he tore on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop a moment to listen for Yamagulu's cry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to hear the forest tuning up for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nocturnal anthem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gloom was so dense now that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not see ahead of him. The canopied</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof seemed writhing with innumerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, groping down--down. He crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily through a tangle of creepers which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be trying to strangle him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashed in water and saw the gleam of</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight on water. He stopped, drown-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mosquitoes in his own sweat, wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he was, hoped that it was the creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouted--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yama-gu-o-o-o-o-o."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oo-oo-oo-o!" answered him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A violent .squawk brought him face</seg><seg type="columnLine">about with his rille to his shoulder. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest murmured and sighed; mosquitoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzzed in clouds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yie-e! squealed a bird at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Muttering something about a tree, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">blundered on along the swamp edge, fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">over something and grabbed. His hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched the edge of a small canoe drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on the swamp grass. At first hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him think that it was his canoe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Yamagulu was in the forest looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him. He gave a mighty yell. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing echo closed his mouth. A short</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigation showed him that the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was smaller than his own. He glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the glimmer of water at the dense</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the opposite jungle. Then sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly like a caress he became aware of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular pulse of a distant drum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Desire carried the conviction that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed on the farther side of the creek from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village and that therefore by crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could make the camp by following the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drum. He placed the rifle in, pushed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe hurriedly over the swamp up to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees and clambered aboard. Pulling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe along the swamp-grass, he made deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">water and began to paddle with his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A dark object near the other side, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought was a floating log, suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashed and disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Crocodiles!" he gasped and paddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">furiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He landed without mishap, dragged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe up as far as possible and stopped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen for the drum. He could hear noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing save the weep of the jungle. The cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain of the trees cut off the vibrations. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated a moment before plunging into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense shadows. The ground became firmer;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it began to rise. On and on he struggled'</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely conscious of the mosquitoes. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the moon and a few paces farther on</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on to the edge of a great glade. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow caught his eager eyes. He hastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it. In the moonlight was the faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">outline of a hut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God!" he muttered. "The vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he hurried on, he perceived a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence around the hut in which was the glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a fire at the base of an enormous tree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The doctor reached the fence and peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. He put up his hand and wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" he murmured. "Am I crazy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seated beneath the great tree in a camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair in the moonlight was a bearded white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in full evening dress; an opera hat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilted on liis head; the firelight glowed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expanse of shirtfront.</seg><seg type="columnLine">rv</seg><seg type="columnLine">"HALLUCINATION!" muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor and pawed at his damp</seg><seg type="columnLine">faceagain. But the image remained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The head wras sunk forward slightly; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown beard straggled over the shirtfront;</seg><seg type="columnLine">one black-sleeved arm hung listlessly out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the chair, the other upon the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee. In the moonlight the eyes glinted</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue as the man stared at the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But a white man in evening kit!" whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered the doctor incredulously. "Here!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good God! No, no," he added after par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the outline of a square hut built be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the enormous boughs of the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree. "It is. I'm not crazy. The feller's</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy. Evening kit--good God! What</seg><seg type="columnLine">the--he must be crazy, poor devil!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The impulse to call out was inhibited.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He began to form excuses to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mustn't call out suddenly," he reflected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"or maybe I shall scare the fife out of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must humor the poor devil. Yes, yes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course--unbalanced. They do go that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way out here. Queer. Understand it, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">begad! Been in the forest all night per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps, poor devil," he added quite as uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of the ludicrous as of the fact jhat he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in reality talking about himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Tree of Life</seg><seg type="columnLine">165</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened his mouth and drew in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath, yet he did not call out. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wriggled his shoulders as if trying to shake</seg><seg type="columnLine">off an incubus. Then he realized that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fearful that, if he shouted, the vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">would disappear and he would know that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was crazy. He peered silently for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments, blinking his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No," he decided. "It is real. -</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer. That bloody forest upset my</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves. Um, Um. Better find the gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and let him see me when I shout. Mustn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">scare the poor devil."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began to move cautiously along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palisade, six feet high, made of stout sap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lings, swallowing and muttering excuses to</seg><seg type="columnLine">account to himself for not shouting. Stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping occasionally to peep through the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terstices, he followed the circle until he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the great trunk of the tree, fully fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in diameter. He paused again for an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other look. That the vision was still there</seg><seg type="columnLine">he noted with a feeling of reassurance. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked around the trunk, he was vaguely</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious that it faced an open expanse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great grove, a cavern of basalt floored</seg><seg type="columnLine">with jade and topped with fantastic pinna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles of chrysoprase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other side he came upon the gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred with great heavy balks of timber.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man sat exactly in the same position;</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not moved a finger apparently. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild thought that he was dead flitted across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor's mind. He began to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath to shout but stopped in indecision.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What should he say? "Hi? Hullo?" Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps the man was not English. Probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">not? What then? The question grew into</seg><seg type="columnLine">absurd importance. Still the doctor stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the balk gate. The rustle of some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the grass behind him evoked an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy movement and a clutching at the rifle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed the fascination in the ludicrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">argument as to exactly what he should say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say, hullo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man did not stir. Then the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was aware that 'he had whispered. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped his rifle lightly and with effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hull-o!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "O-o!" repeated the grove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor glared anxiously, dreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the figure would disappear. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head rose slowly; the eyes moved. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head sank despondently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "lhank God, he is there," muttered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor, "but he thinks I'm an owl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say--er--hullo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more the beard rose slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say, I'm here!" continued the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatuously. He could see the eyes staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if mildly inquiring in the moonlight. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, old chap, are you English? It's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right! Er--would you mind letting me in?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He perceived the beard to part suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disclosing white teeth. The man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God," murmured the doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He is crazy. Poor feller!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say," he began again, enunciating care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, "I've lost--my--way, y'know. Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">you mind--letting me in? I'm Herd-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wether--Borden Millar Herd wether. Oh</seg><seg type="columnLine">-! Hi! I'm an English doctor, Mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dalen and London. I say, aren't you En-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glish? Par/ez-vous franqais ? Eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still smiling distinctly in the moonlight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man raised a white hand and slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved it toward the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" ejaculated the doctor, shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering involuntarily. ".Am I crazy or are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared. The eyes resumed the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spondent contemplation of the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What on earth am I to do? He thinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm not here, and I thought he wasn't." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pawed at his damp hair. "If I throw any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to attract his attention, he'll think I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lion or some wild animal. And I'm not."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The little doctor was unconscious of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimper in his voice. "I can't stop out</seg><seg type="columnLine">here all uight, -it, and who is he, any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way? But what's he want to dress for?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he complained bitterly and glanced behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at the cavern of the grove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor became aware of an illusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was within a barred cage like a cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive monkey and that the man inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence was free. "There must be wild ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals, or else he wouldn't have this con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">founded fence. Um."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strange man rose to his feet, yawned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stretched his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "O God, he's going to bed!" muttered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor resentfully. "It can't be more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine o'clock." Then desperately, as the tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">black back revealed the swallow tails, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted: "Hii! For God's sake, let me in!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tall figure turned sharply in his direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes!" bawled the doctor. "It's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right! I'm here, I tell you! Herdwetlier!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man was staring in his direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, yes, come and let me in, and I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">i66</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain!" The beard waggled slowly as if in</seg><seg type="columnLine">regretful dissent. "I am here!" yelled Lhe</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor frantically. "Englishman. Doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm lost. Help!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man took two paces, stopped, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke incomprehensible words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No! no!" screamed the doctor. "Speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">English! P cadet franqaisl"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could sec the beard move as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man were talking to himself. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fellow stoo]&gt;ed, picked up a glowing fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brand and slowly walked toward the gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "God, he thinks I'm a gorilla," muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor and involuntarily brought up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ritie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "For God's sake, speak, man!" he yelled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm real, 1 tell you! I'm a white man!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bearded man in full evening dress with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a firebrand in his hand stopped abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stared toward the fence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A white man!" he exclaimed. "Where?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh, my God, where?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here! Here! I'm lost! Let me in! I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man hesitated, moved as if to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the brand, arrested his arm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped again to peer at the fence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who and what are you?" he demanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Are you real--or am I crazy? Speak!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">""No. No. I'm real!" shouted the doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm English, I tell you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      THE man appeared satisfied, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he threw away the firebrand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced with long eager strides '</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the gate, wrenched up the balks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">timber and then, as if suddenly suspicious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped backward clear of the entrance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The doctor walked through, took off his hel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">met and held out his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How d'you do, sir! I'm Herdwether."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The big man gazed down at him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed a hand to his forehead perplexedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose it's all right," he mumbled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"-if I know. Er--how d'vou do!" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the extended hand perfunctorily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I--er--don't quite understand--yet. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">said--are you a white man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes," said the doctor soothingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wliite, I assure you.

I--er--lost my way and--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw your fire; so I just came along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The eyes were still regarding him rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a great child, uncertain as to w-hether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the visitor was a tramp or an angel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My name's Herdwether--Borden Millar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herdwether.

Oh."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gazing incredulously, the man shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">l&gt;eard as if trying to throw off an illusion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sorry.

Warren-Dukely, the explorer?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed the doctor in astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The man giggled, throwing Ijack his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I beg your pardon!" he added more</seg><seg type="columnLine">rationally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not at all," said the doctor. "Not at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. Er--I wonder if you'd mind if we sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">down? I--er--I'm rather fagged out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fagged out, what?" The words ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to act as a restorative. "I say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm awfully sorry. Of course! Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">along." He started off toward the fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped abruptly and, murmuring, "For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten the door, old boy!" hurried back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">readjusted the balks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor waited for him. trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch a glimpse of the face. The man re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned with great eager strides and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor's amazement caught him by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and spun him around face to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God Almighty!" he exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's good!" He dropped him as sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly. "I say, I beg your pardon!

I haven't seen a white man for years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 don't know. I--but come and sit down."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He strode forward to the hut, his swallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails flirting in the moonlight, and emerged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragging another camp-chair. "Sit down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man. By the way, I didn't quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch? Herwether?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Herdwether," said the doctor, sitting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he almost giggled as he saw the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick up his tails as he sat as if he were in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dukely still stared a little incredulously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The doctor observed in the fire-glow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gauntness of the cheek-bones and the sunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Embarrassed, he looked at the fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He can't be quite crazy if he knows it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but what on earth is he dressed for!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Conscious of the eyes devouring him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat still, considerately waiting for his host to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My God, it's good to see you!" exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dukely at length. "I--d'you know I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Tree of Life</seg><seg type="columnLine">your voice calling, but--but, - it, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought I was dreaming."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understand," said the doctor quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"One gets rather ratty after a while.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Begin to see things if you're not careful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Er--V you camping near here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," assented the doctor. "Down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basa-something's village, wherever that is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was out shooting, y'know, and got lost."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he stole a glance at the man, a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeve crept out, and a hand lightly touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm. Involuntarily the doctor started.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet he had noticed that the hand was well</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept, the nails polished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was silence for some minutes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest murmured and whispered and wept.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet the sinister note was missing to the doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor's ears. Twice he glanced up at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearded gaunt face. The man continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stare almost like a yokel gawping at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a circus fat lady. The doctor was embar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rassed. A thousand questions leaped to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Er," he broke out at length. - "I wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether you have such a thing as a glass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water? I'm simply parched."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dukely leaped from his chair as if gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly, certainly!" he muttered. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">an awful rotter!" and he disappeared into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hut to emerge writh a calabash of water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, thanks very much!" The doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated, glanced at the hut and up at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall man in evening dress. He fumbled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hip pocket. "Um. I--you don't mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I--do you care for whisky?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whisky!" echoed Dukely. The eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightened at the glint of a silver flask and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were masked politely. "Good God, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't tasted whisky for--oh thanks!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He almost grabbed, swallowed at a gulp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tot of spirit which the doctor had prof-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erred in the screw-cap; then he gasped, shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his head at Lhe calabash. The doctor took</seg><seg type="columnLine">his share and a deep drink of water. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed the calabash on the ground beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, the man sat down slowly and fell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing at his visitor again without speaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God," thought the doctor, "is he</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to stare at me all night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Er by the way," said he desperately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"have you--are you staying here long?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man started and seemed to shiver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said slowly--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'm going to be married in a day or</seg><seg type="columnLine">so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes, ah, of course," assented the doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor politely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm the King of the Wood, y'know."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, yes, yes," ejaculated the doctor as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, "My God, he's as mad as a hatter."</seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     THE man with the beard laughed,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     a rusty throaty sound, and stroked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     his nose delicately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I beg your pardon," said he. "I'm a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little ratty.

The doctor looked away. "Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite--yet." He stared at the fire medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatively. "By the way, what did you say</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were here for, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm on a commission; economic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">social investigation, y'know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Social, eh?

Not at all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you do! Oh yes. Quite natural.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should myself. By the way, you're not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hurry, are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh no, not at all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The teeth gleamed through the beard</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a smile at the fire.

"But have another."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks, old man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The skinny white hand again just re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frained from grabbing the screw-cap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the Lord, that's good!" he gasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he handed back the flask.

"That's awfully good of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you! No, don't bother for a match."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bent forward, picked a firebrand with</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate fingers and sighed at the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">puff. He sat back seemingly absorbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the joy of the inhalation. The doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to note details: that the shirt was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft and yellow, frayed; the parched skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn tightly over an acquiline nose, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the care bestowed on the liands; even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard had been trimmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," began Warren-D ukely reflec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively.

Er--what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mischief was I gassing about?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You were going to tell me how you</seg><seg type="columnLine">became King of the Wood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "King of the Wood? Did I say that--</seg><seg type="columnLine">really? This cigar seems awful strong, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way. Still, years since I smoked one."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he sprang to his feet and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending over -the doctor's chair, touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bare hand as he picked up the calabash.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood with the water in his hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled down at the visitor in a relieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder whether you could spare?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">insinuated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I don't think you had better," observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor quietly. "A little later perhaps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're not accustomed to it, y'know."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Quite right! Quite right! And you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">need it yourself. I'd forgotten that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll need it? Oh, you mean--it isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. I've a good supply with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "So had I, old boy; so had I," muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warren-Dukely as he turned away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the calabash of water in his hand. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair he stopped, glanced at it and threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Tree of Life</seg><seg type="columnLine">it away irritably. "- it, I continually</seg><seg type="columnLine">do that. Carry things about. Still what</seg><seg type="columnLine">does it matter?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sticking the cigar in his mouth, he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to pace up and down before the fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at the ground. The doctor did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not disturb him. Presently he began with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a jerk:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'VE got it, by Jove. I know. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began yarning about that first</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition, didn't I? Well, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Africa seemed to get in my blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I broke off the engagement with Sybil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had to, only decent thing to do. Can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect a woman to wait--like a sergeant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife? An' one can't drag her around</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, eh? 'Sides, I'm not a marrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Never was. Poor old Sybby. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder whether she's still running the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cheshire?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh well, on the second trip I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mania to come through Tchad, pick np</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boyd .Alexander's trail--poor old boy--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and zigzag down through the Albert Lakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and land eventually in Rhodesia. I circled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tchad and went off to the Dinka country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Told you all that though, didn't I? Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never mind. I tacked back here an' barged</seg><seg type="columnLine">into old Basayaguru as you -did, eh? An'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the -- old cutthroat made me King of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Wood!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped to raise his head and emit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that throaty chuckle. The doctor, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him keenly, began to revise his opinion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his sanity. He wheeled round, one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck under the tails of his coat and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other holding the cigar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bally idiot, ain't I?" he demanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You wait, ol' boy! Your inning's next for</seg><seg type="columnLine">King of the Wood." He barked rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than laughed this time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Still, I've played the game, - your</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes!" He appeared to be addressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody unseen, but he said, "No, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean you, Doc." He began to pace again</seg><seg type="columnLine">moodily. "Sorry, ol' chap," he said as</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly. "You'll understand as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I can spit it out. I say, the old boy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">very generous with his ivory an' stuff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"H'm. Thought so. Invited you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">witness the Marriage of the Sacred Tree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Y-yes," admitted the little doctor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering why he felt uneasy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Same hellish trick. Still, it would have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been the same anyway. How many men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have you, Doc?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Twenty-five. Three canoes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"All armed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well--Sniders enough for all of 'em,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh pish!" he waved an impatient hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Wrhat bally rot I'm talking. Isn't a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dog's chance. My dear old boy, I had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fifty--all armed with Martinis."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I'm afraid I don't understand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Good God, of course you don't! I say,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know anything about folklore?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"A little."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Talked about the Sacred Tree, didn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, that's the bloody thing there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He raised a hand to the giant tree above</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him. "Mother of all an' has to have a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">husband every year."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"So I understand. My head man, Ali</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mohammed, told me that they have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">muddled some ancient Arab philosophy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with their own superstitions. Very inter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">esting ceremony, I should imagine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Interestin' ceremony! -!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Agitatedly the tall man began to pace</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up and down before the fire again, sucking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fiercely at the stump of the cigar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'm to be the - thing's husband,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he jerked out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Indeed," said the doctor interestedly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for he knew of many ceremonies prevalent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in Europe as elsewhere of the symbolical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">marriage of a girl to a tree. Then sud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">denly, "Oh, you mean that they've kept</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you here a prisoner for this ceremony of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">theirs?

I mean of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">course I'll help you to-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Warren-Dukely wheeled upon him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swiftly and, pointing his cigar at him,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cried:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But you - fool. I've told you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you're trapped for the next husband."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Husband!" repeated the little doctor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bewilderedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But what--w'hat happens to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Me? I'm sacrificed to this confounded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ju-ju. Are you blind? The night of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">marriage orgy they carve me up, wipe out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">your camp and stick you here to make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">magic for twelve moons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My God!" ejaculated the little doctor,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">half rising to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">iyo</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">WARREN-DUKELY hurled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar stump into the fire, turned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heel and flung his body into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. The doctor remained for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring incredulously; then, as if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped the import of the man's words</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had decided that they were sane, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up abruptly and came over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warren-Dukely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This--this seems incredible!

"Sit down, old boy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Herdwether returned to his chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusedly, unable yet to decide whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">or no the story was the result of a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered brain. Warren-Dukely dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his chair close beside the doctor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaned forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My brain's all right now, Doc. Er--</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgive me, but I can't resist touching you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see if you're there, y'know. By the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's why I dress sometimes. Just to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep myself sane. Helps.

Sit down, man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Suddenly he sprang to his height and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slapped the doctor on the shoulder so that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he sat down hurriedly. Then, tilting the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">opera hat upon the side of his head like a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">comedian, he lifted up his beard toward the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moon and trolled in a husky tenor:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, landlord, fill the flowing bowl until it doth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   run over--ove-er!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For tonight we'll mem-, merry be!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For tonieht we'll merry, merry be!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For tonight we'll merry, mcrr-y b-e-e-!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tomorrow we'll be so-ber!''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the last w'ord he snatched off his hat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and stood bareheaded in the moonlight as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the forest answered coldly--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">\ "O-be-r."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Listen!" he cried, gesturing largely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"There's my faithful pal!

"For</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">God's sake, buck up! I'm neither drunk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nor crazy! But, Lord, you're the first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">entertainment I've had for twelve moons!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fourteen moons! Moon! Moons! Moons!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing but moons! Wilde knew-little</seg><seg type="columnLine">about moons to what I know! I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched; I've studied; I've wooed--every</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody one of the fourteen moons!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down!" said the doctor sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tall figure wheeled toward him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down, and we'll have a drink.

You dear old duck, I haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">had such a time since ma died!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hat went careering wildly through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moonlight, turned a somersault and</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled drunkenly on one rim. Warren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dukely dragged his chair a foot, lumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it and caught his hand to his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry, old man; I'll be good. Fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead with that drink though." Then in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dreary voice as the doctor pulled out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flask, "You know' you haven't an idea as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to what this means to me. One gets used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to anything in life. But--well, I did want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak to a white man once more. Tribal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, but--" He dropped his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">to watch at the gurgle of liquid. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, Doc, old pal, I'm so - glad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see you! I feel like a bally woman wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comin her lover an' all that sort of thin*.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm glad, but I guess you ain't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, drink this, and you'll feel better,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the doctor, proffering the screw-cap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks!" Warren-Dukely gulped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquor at a draft. "Lord, how it bites!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now you have a drink, an' I'll try to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you what sort of a picnic you're in for.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh, thanks a million times!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He accepted the cigar, lighted it with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brand, leaned back and puffed reflectively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The distant anthem pulsed steadily. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">night-bird squawked persistently. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint vibration of the drum just reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. After lighting his cigar, the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">said quietly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know, Dukely, I can't quite realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, you can't! It's taken me</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve moons to realize it.

We can't be murdered by these</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I object, I admit." The throaty chuckle</seg><seg type="columnLine">wTas repeated. "Now let me tell you, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">then you'll understand, I'll guarantee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Er. H'm. My mind's foggin' again. Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes, I know-."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared up at the sinister boughs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant tree. The eyes hardened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nervous twitching of the fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">began again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I think I can do it. You need</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, anyhow--to understand." He leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, kicked the embers of the fire into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blaze and plunged abruptly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you how they caught me, eh?</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the same trick of apparent friendliness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Invited me to the show, y'know. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. Two days before that drum there</seg><seg type="columnLine">began. Sound physiological idea. Works</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em up. All right. On the openin' night</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was led here an' given an orchestra stall</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the orchestra was tunin' up. Same</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon. Same tree. Whole crowd of 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. Mumblin' an' chantin' just beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in the open space. Old chief on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bally throne tiling an' the young 'un.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master of ceremonies--your pal-- Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll bet he's been your special friend, eh?</seg><seg type="columnLine">With his head-dress--looked like a lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">mayor's hat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, whole bunch of young girls an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">my illustrious predecessor, the King of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wood. He sat beneath the tree there</seg><seg type="columnLine">just outside the gate. Of course. I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">twig the game--then. D'you see 'em in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moonlight? Then that - drum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming--all the time--persistent--seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get in your bally head, y'know, or your</seg><seg type="columnLine">veins--heart. I felt excited myself. Seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">various sort of dances before an' all that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But--somehow this was different. Real</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, I suppose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sort of tiling they never do for white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men except when they're--they're to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the piece de resistance, y'know. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't. They had told me somethin' about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the principle of the thing: the marriage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the husband person--a great big devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the way, more negro than these people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Came from the Kameroons, I believe;</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner of war. They have an amusing</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea that the bigger the man the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lady--I mean the tree--is pleased. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, I suppose. Of course, white man an*</seg><seg type="columnLine">white magic an' all that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, they kept up this - drum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming an' wnigglin' about--usual witch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor business--for the devil of a time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drinkin' all the time native beer, y'know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">172</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fermented corn. Then the girls' stomach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dances an' all that. Meanwhile the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">feller sat up there in the shadow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree, sulky, silent. God knows whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew what was coming. I began to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">bored." Again that throaty chuckle with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a harsh rasp to it. "God--see the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">old thing all over again. Then, just as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon spilled over that big bough there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and covered the big negro, there came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">change. That must have been the mystic</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign, I suppose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, your pal, Yamala, prancing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly ceased his croonin' row and</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted at the fellow, together with a crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">of other black devils.

They had him</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped over there in the moonlight--an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">a knife--old Yamala." The beard jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he were biting his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God--I've seen things. Of course, you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">a doctor an' used to carvin'--but, God, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have made you sick." Again he</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved restlessly in his chair.

Of course, I didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">then that it was an island. Well, I was in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">-of a rage.

She was a courtezan and while living with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Averill plied her trade and some of the neighboring</seg><seg type="columnLine">punchers and owners paid her for favors received in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mavericks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">^YERY also was a land surveyor and knew too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much about the choice bits of Government</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands which some of the big cow outfits had fenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. Between these two tilings the hatred of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these outfits grew to such an extent that one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Averill and Ella were going to the then new</seg><seg type="columnLine">town of Casper they were ambushed on the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">north of the Sweetwater and near the mouth of Dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creek and both were hung on a tree which was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing some four years ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The required coroner's inquest was held, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paties were never prosecuted. It was a cowardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dastardly crime. Cattle Kate was written up</seg><seg type="columnLine">179</seg><seg type="columnLine">i8o</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Lhe newspapers in luri&lt;l and fanciful colors as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashing cowgirl, dead shot and a few other things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing to that but hot air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for McCoy the only one answering to the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scription was Bob McCoy of Therutopolis, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed some few years ago uhder peculiar circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances. He was shot by unknown parties; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body then dragged to the river edge and a nosebag</seg><seg type="columnLine">strapped around his head and then the body a* far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the shoulders put under water. Hob was sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to be pretty swift in the use of a rope. Other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise he was not a particularly hard citizen.--. --. --.</seg><seg type="columnLine">\X70ULDNT it be a sort of good idea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> *	▼ for our magazine to have a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">emblem or sign or whatever you want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">call it? An '"Adventure, its Mark" affair?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Might use it on its stationery some day, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are various little purposes for which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might come in handy. Tried it out, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">example, on the preceding page. Here it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in large size--a kind of coat-of-arms ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangement. Does it get by?</seg><seg type="columnLine">OUR Camp-Fire is the best agency in</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence for collecting hitherto un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">published chanteys, ballads and other sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">songs and rescuing them before they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost forever. It's another job for us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one as interesting as it is worth while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We have been fortunate in getting, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid us in this work, the friendly cooperation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of John F. Lomax, who is perhaps the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority on this subject. With him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide and expert we can be sure that what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we collect will be assessed at its right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and full value.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whenever any of you sends in a hitherto</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpublished chantey or sea-song or a ballad</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Great Lakes or Erie Canal we'll try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have it at our Camp-Fire for the benefit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all of us. And we hope that later on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Lomax will have enough of them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">embody in a book for still more permanent</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Of course original productions have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in this collodion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Some time in the future we might try</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hand at collecting unpublished cowboy</seg><seg type="columnLine">songs and songs of the old West in general.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And perhaps the lumberjack songs some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  •Some of the songs are of course too broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be printable, but some of these have</seg><seg type="columnLine">merits that offset that point and, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have any of Lhe latter, no doubt Mr. Lomax</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be interesled in them. •</seg><seg type="columnLine">tpOLLOWING is a list of the published</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanteys and songs so far as accessible</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Lhe New York Public Library.

The greatest Missouri tract is in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">overflow formed by Cane Creek and Little Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">River. Those best known to the writer are in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mississippi County, Arkansas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Big Lake, Arkansas, is a Government preserve.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can fish there, but commercial fishing is under</seg><seg type="columnLine">control of the Government. It is formed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">widening of Little River and was for many years</seg><seg type="columnLine">the source of much rivalry between clubs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">market hunters, and was the largest shipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">section for wild ducks in the U.

Missouri, and extend into most of north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastern Arkansas. The present conditions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">created by the earthquake of 1813 when the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunk and earthquakes were felt at intervals for</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost a year. Audubon, the naturalist, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable note of it. For a short time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mississippi River ran up-stream.

Anyhow, here is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of interesting comment by two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who know what they're talking about:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Question:--"Just to get in on this gun chatter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let me say that I learned to use a gun at the tender</seg><seg type="columnLine">age of 8, in the big timber of Minnesota. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time that I ever fired a gun was away prior</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that time, however. My mother, sister and</seg><seg type="columnLine">three brothers had allowed me to visit the sugar</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp with them. On the way to camp my oldest</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother shot a ruffled grouse--partridge, we called</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reloaded the single-barreled Harper's Ferry</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothbore, set it against the log cabin, and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gather sap. .All the rest moved off. I tackled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun, got it over a small log, braced my belly</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the butt, locked both middle fingers over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trigger and--gosh, how quick I sat down!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had to set the butt on the ground and cock the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun by pushing down with both hands, but I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I scared the women folks crazy, got a shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Frank, my senior, had a sore spot on my front</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevation, but, Lordy, how big I felt!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have, hunted with Mississippi Yaegers, Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tucky squirrel rifles, the old Harper's Ferry gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">(for years), with paper cartridge Sharps that</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried an ounce round ball, with Belgian muskets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Ballards, Colts, Wessons, Henry, Spencer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">L. C. Smith shotgun, with Winchesters. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">write three Winchesters hang above me on the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">.22 special, .32-.40, and a .45-.70 meat-getter, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry Knibbs calls it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having had a half century of gun experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">I claim to be there to a certain extent, with knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of weapons and 1 smiled with a sincere pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I read what Chas. Beadle said in the February</seg><seg type="columnLine">3rd issue. A .45 automatic will kick itself up if</seg><seg type="columnLine">hred rapidly till it shoots far above the target.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have tried them out on the Beverly Hill Gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">Club range and have had numerous others try</seg><seg type="columnLine">them while I watched. There arc few men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">can hold one down to its work and rattle off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots at the same speed that a fair gunman with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good old six-gun S. A. when spotting his bull</seg><seg type="columnLine">every crack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have seen a man who had used an automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a year try both on a 25-yard target and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">score, rapid fire, was 50 per cent, better with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old gun. Then one of the boys who had an auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic and boasted of its excellence, tried six shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">at speed and his last shot went out at about 15</seg><seg type="columnLine">degrees above the target, each shot kicking it</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher. He simply could not hold it down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I own two D. A. six-guns, but I always use</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as S. A. weapons. In case some guy bats</seg><seg type="columnLine">me over the head and climbs my frame, I may use</seg><seg type="columnLine">the self-cocking device to save his feelings, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise. I agree with Chester, but here is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point for the novice who wants to learn. Get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know' the feel and hang of your gun just as a me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanic learns a tool. A good carpenter ran drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nail straight while he looks away from it. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know' your gun right it flips on the bull as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes from the holster, at any short range, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">190</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  lake ihe empty gun in the privacy of your own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">room and practise drawing and throwing down on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">objects, also swinging directly on the bull from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the holster, without any extra motion. I never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">throw down but shoot on the rise. To prove that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1 understood throwing down 1 have dipped both</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">top and bottom of a 3-inch bull and centered it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the third shot, rapid fire, throwing down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a 44, but I Like my own style better. 1 lose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no motion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My experience with the .32-.20 S. &amp; W.:</seg><seg type="columnLine">I once drilled a jack rabbit through the head at</seg><seg type="columnLine">S3 yards, only to have him go on slowly hopping</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a dazed fashion till I caught him. Never upset</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Yet it tears a thundering hole when the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose touches a bone in a bigger animal. But my</seg><seg type="columnLine">good old Colts .45 is the burglar annihilator, ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant gun, whale-killer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ihe S. &amp; W. .44-.40 will do the work, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">and do it up brown. One I had not long ago used</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a 600-pound grizzly in three shots, whidi isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">so darned bad after all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The .32-.20 may be what old Vincent, up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our mountains here, calls "A - pea shooter,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it is such a beauty and such a performer on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the range and at small game that I love it. 11 will</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay with me till I croak, and then my grandson</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets it if he can shoot right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the argument concerning which gun opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the West, I say the rifle. The six-gun was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrapper's gun, the gun for brawls and murders</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for most of the arrests by officers, but the rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the bulk of the real work in making buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Injuns absent and varmints scary. Let the ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern hoot at the Winchester and praise his Ross</seg><seg type="columnLine">or his Newton, but the .45-.70 or .45-.90 cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wide swath down which decent men could walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the Russo-Turkish war there were many</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russians killed at over two miles range by dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire from .45-.90 Winchesters. A gun that</seg><seg type="columnLine">will do that is no slouch of a cannon. Remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the mine superintendent said in the Led</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horse Claim--"A Winchester is a mighty com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehensive weapon," and many a pioneer thanked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gods that it was so when he was up against</seg><seg type="columnLine">*red or white outlaws. Many such have found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rifle a better weapon, properly handled, than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a six-gun."--E. E. Harriaian, Los Angeles, Calif.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Answer, by Mr. Wiggins:--Mr. Harri man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience with automatics seems to be similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">many others of which I know. I think the revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">at high speed lines up more naturally and accurately</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the automatic. The double action is beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">all doubt quicker than the single action. I con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider either one preferable to an automatic for</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A good shot will draw a revolver and hit a can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from three to six shots when the can is thrown in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">air, the revolver being drawn after it was thrown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Also the revolver, caliber for caliber, seems to have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more killing effect than the automatic, due to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soft lead bullet of the revolver expanding slightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I have never known of an instance where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet from a .45 Colt failed to knock a man off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet. I do not think'the .32- .20 is the equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the .38 special for stopping power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There is no doubt that the rifle killed off most of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the bad characters, but I think the credit should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">go to Col. Colt for origination of the multi-shot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weapon I recollect an instance of a horse thief</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">being killed wjth a 45 Colt at a distance of L'60</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards. Short range weapon, eh?</seg><seg type="columnLine">British Honduras</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A PPARENTLY it's up to some venture-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some soul to penetrate the jungles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ranges of this little known land and</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out what it's like.

No human being could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever see tins far in British Honduras, for a clear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">day is a rare thing, due to the excessive rainfall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at all seasons. The actual temperature is not high,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ranging from 26 to 30 centigrade, but on account</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the humidity it is very oppressive and quickly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saps the vitality. It is possibly for this reason</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the inhabitants of British Honduras are easily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the laziest of all Central America.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">y There are very few white people in British</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Honduras. The bulk of the population is negro</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and mulatto who speak a poor kind of English</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which puzzles a newcomer, a few pure Carib</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Indians, mixed Carib-Ncgro breeds, and Spanish-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Indian or Spanish-Negro mixtures. The entire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">colony is sparsely settled and is distributed as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">follows: District of Beliz, 5,000; Corozal, 1,804;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Orange Walk, 3,700; Stann Creek, 5,166; Toledo,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">2,400; and Cayo, 2,000.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Very Utile is known of the interior of this country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As small as it is the people are too lazy to go back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into it and see what it is like.

The British government</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">keeps a few negro soldiers from Jamaica stationed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at various points to preserve order. The colony</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is ruled by a governor, assisted by a congress of ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">members.

In the hill country com, rice, manioc</seg><seg type="columnLine">(from which tapioca is made), cotton, aloe, coffee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cacao (chocolate), oranges, bananas, rubber,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pepper, and many other products thrive easily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The price of land (government Crown land) is nom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inally fixed at five dollars a hectare (over two acres).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Traces of gold, silver and lead have been found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some of the creeks of this country, but nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any note. The formation of the Cockscombs</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a hard granite with quartz veins cropping out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in places. Hunting placer ground is a rather tedious</seg><seg type="columnLine">process, due to the heavy growth of jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lowland was once sea-bottom and was doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less built up to its present level by coral growth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There have been a few small placer operations</seg><seg type="columnLine">at various points in the colony but I have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of one that amounted to much. For my</seg><seg type="columnLine">part T would not suggest British Honduras if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are thinking of trying to locate placer ground or</seg><seg type="columnLine">dredging ground. However, it will only cost you</seg><seg type="columnLine">a §5 tax to try it out. That is what the govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment charges for prospecting license.
