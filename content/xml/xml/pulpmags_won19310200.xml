            <seg type="columnLine">most of these unknowable things are prob-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">of our own minds.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The human being, after all, is only a</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It is so with the human mind. The</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">inadequate to comprehend what it is all</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">For instance, a few hundred years ago,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">it fell back on his chest again. A horrible</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I picked up the machine in the periscope</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">him. I remained several miles behind, not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wishing to alarm him, but he seemed deter-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mined to shake us off. He executed a num-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I followed him with ease, however, and he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Fifteen minutes or so*-later, Dalton re-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in a silent convoy. There was no sign from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them; they kept their distance in perfect</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">formation. We could not guess their inten-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tions. There was not a hostile move from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">any of them. The members of our party</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">wheeling about as though to cut off our</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">without some misgivings, but the creatures</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seemed friendly enough, waving their arms</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and giving voice to questioning hoots. One</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of their number advanced and extended his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">To pass the time, we examined the walls</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">about two feet high and a little over a foot</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wide. The blocks were joined together by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a tongue and groove in each, neatly polished</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to a perfect fit. Several heavy bars of metal</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">while the Ganymedians slashed open La-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">This trip of exploration served to pass</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the time while the guns were being made.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Finally the hour of departure arrived with</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">munition. We took off"with a rush amid</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">headed for the cloudy land surrounding the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ocean. We five had worn our air-envelopes,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for they gave protection from the poisoned</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">vided an easy means of conversation at a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">distance, through the radio equipment. As</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the miles flew away below us a tension grew</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the entire crew. We realized more keen-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ly now than at any time before our desper-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ate situation. At all costs we must regain</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the Comet; yet we would have a battle on</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">*The construction and functioning of the projectiles</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were as follows: There were three concentric shells,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the outermost of heavy aluminum, the second of brit-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tle clay, and the third of copper. Between the first</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and second was a layer of hydrogen chloride, frozen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at --110 degrees Centigrade. Between the second and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">third was supercooled ice, The shock of discharge</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">broke the second shell, mixing the ice and hydrogen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chloride, which were melted by the heat of the pro-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">jectile's passage through Ganymede's atmosphere, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at the same time kept the copper shell cool. The solu-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tion of hydrogen chloride in water formed hydro-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chloric acid, which destroyed the aluminum shell. This</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">acid does not attack copper as it does aluminum,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">so the inner shell reached the earth intact. Inside</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it was a mixture of sulphur, manganese dioxide and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">potassium chlorate. The last contains oxygen in com-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bination, which it gives up when heated to about 200</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">degrees Centigrade in the presence of manganese di-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">oxide. The heating was accomplished by friction with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the earth's atmosphere. Sulphur burns in pure oxygen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with a brilliant blue flame, the resulting; gas (sulphur</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dioxide) serving in this case to burst the copper case</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and make the conflagration visible.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">knives. Planes patrolled the air above the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The commander of the plane evidently</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought likewise, for he headed up toward</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">called, and I made a suggestion.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"I think it best," I offered, "that you</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Ganymedians, disembarked and stole into</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">disturb the normal course of events, as Mr. Nicholson,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">has pictured it.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">However our publishing of such time traveling</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stories, as a change from our former policy, is basea</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on two thoughts:</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The first is that although logically the time traveling</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">episode will lead to the sort of absurdity Mr. Nicholson,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pointed out, logic may not be the whole truth of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">matter. Time traveling neccessarily means a projec-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tion into the fourth dimension and an entering into a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">new order of life. Before the Einstein theory was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">propounded, people would have received its edicts with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">derision as being contrary to logic. The idea of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">constancy of the velocity of light for example is absurd</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">until it is explained by the reduction in length of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">body and the reduction of time. Even this idea of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">change of time between two bodies one of which is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">moving at or near the speed of light, (as Dr. Breuer</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pointed out so well in "The Time Valve") is logically</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">absurd, yet true.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So we must realize that the laws of nature we per-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ceive and the things we call logic are not the whole</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">truth of nature and we must be prepared to see flomo</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of our logical notions rudely shattered.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This- leads to the second reason for permitting time</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">traveling stories. Once we admit that time traveling</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is theoretically possible, the allowing of the time travel-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">er to take part in that world of the past or future</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">(we are not inclined very much to permit such past</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time traveling stories for the past is fixed) gives</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him the opportunity to develop a much better story.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">After all the reason for a time traveling story is nob</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">so much to travel in time but to show what our future</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">civilization is to be like. If the story shows in »</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">vivid, interesting and imaginative manner what our</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">race of the future is to be like, then it has served its</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">purpose. Of course Mr. Nicholson is right in saying</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that the only safe way of preserving logic in timo</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">traveling is by suspended animation. But who of our</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">readers would want every story to open, "And as he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes, they met a strange sight."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">We hope this explains our point of view on time</seg>
