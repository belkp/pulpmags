                        <span type="columnLine">He was satisfied in his own mind that</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">close to the ground, to my mind, now on</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">was his job to keep her off the ground.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">Down at the far end of the field he</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">pointed her blunt old nose at the sky and</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">lifted her in a zoom that was terrific, and</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">leveled her just as she would have</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">stalled. He turned a wing-tip up there,</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">steam, so I must have been out for some</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">time. I felt of my mouth to see how</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">another one—a memory of that tense</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">as he had been, the long walk had done</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">effect. But he had reached that stage</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">where he was surly and defiant. He</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">demanded a drink and Stronk refused</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">it. Stronk intended that Kay should</span>

                        <span type="columnLine"> While Stronk debated between using</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">his fists upon Kay or leaving him</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">lay, Kay settled the question by falling</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">asleep. There was little likelihood that</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">he would awaken before Stronk could</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">return for him. Stronk cursed the snor-</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">ing Kay and moved on with Astra.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">Astra took hope: something might yet</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">turn up! Stronk told her his plan. He</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">would take her to the plane, bind her</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">and leave her in the rear cock-pit while</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">he returned for Kay.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> But all hope fled after they reached</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">the plane and Stronk had trussed her</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">up. He bound her arms close to her</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">sides and fastened her ankles together</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">He placed her in the rear cock-pit and</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">covered it over with a tarpaulin that was</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">secured and held down on all sides by</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">snaps. In her trussed and cramped</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">condition, she was far from comfortable;</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">and all hope of escaping unaided fled.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">For the first time her thoughts centered</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">upon Kay.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> Kay had repulsed her by his drunken-</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">talked about in his maudlin maunderings</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">she felt a certain degree of pity for him.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">Garbled though it was, Astra had been</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">able to piece Kay's story together</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">enough to understand that he had taken</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">to drink because a woman had proved</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">unfaithful to him. She had heard</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">stories of men who had taken to drink</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">for that reason; but Astra knew little</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">of men. His diatribe against women,</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">she considered the effect of the liquor,</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">that he hated all women seemed incon-</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">ceivable. But under any circumstances,</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">it was toward Kay that she must look</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">for aid now. If he carried her aboard</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">the ship, her last hope would be gone.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">But she vowed to herself that the pic-</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">ture Stronk had painted of a moon-lit</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">deck would never be a reality. Then a</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">chagrined flush overspread her face,</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">there was something in her back-pocket</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">that was causing her discomfort. She</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">had not thought of it once at a time</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">when it might have been of service, nor</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">had Stronk discovered it. It was her</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">fell into a fretful slumber. That day</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">he was not angry, and he did not under-</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">on hands and knees, she was struggling</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">to her feet. He bent over to grasp her</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">arms and she whirled upon her back and</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">lay flat, drawing her legs up like the</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">sent him reeling backward. A groping</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">He lay motionless.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> Astra sprang to her feet and advanced</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">over him. Her face went deathly white.</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">Stronk reached a decision. To stop</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">and then as past events came back to</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">erected the canopy over him, he knew</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">that she had not abandoned him. She</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">had gone for help, he told himself. He</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">found the mackinaw, her mackinaw,</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">were bullion cubes. He had instructed</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">with other supplies. Kay wished now</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">them. Glancing over the side, Peter</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">found himself staring directly down at</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">the broad body and great wings of the</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">black ship. She had turned North dur-</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">ing the flight, and was now winging her</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">way steadily into California, toward</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">some mysterious destination known only</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">to those hooded men who crouched in</span>

                        <span type="columnLine"> Donovan, his face a question mark,</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">glanced back at the pilot. His jaw was</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">set, his mouth grim, and the joy of</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">battle blazed in his gray eyes. Peter</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">knew what Donovan was asking him;</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">he knew the question written on the</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">white face ahead. Could he go on and</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">fight the big ship? Did he have the</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">strength and the courage to pilot his</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">crippled plane into another attack?</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> Peter set his teeth and nodded. He</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">could. With his own gun jammed, his</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">landing gear smashed to splinters, one</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">wing wobbling flabbily, he was ready to</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">go in and finish the job.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> Donovan nodded his approval and</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">turned again to his gun. Peter nosed</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">the plane down and dived.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> The men in the big ship below had</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">located their enemy and were making</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">desperate effort to get away. The twin</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">motors roared furiously. From the</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">rear cockpit came the steady pounding</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">of a gun.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> Peter grinned as he heard the familiar</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">big plane, he reflected. But he must</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">stick to his job, pilot the Jenny to the</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">last. They must bring that black ship</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">down, hang on its tail and fight it until</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">it was either driven to earth or the</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">pilots were killed. That ship had the</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">precious cargo they were after. In it</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">lay the hope of solving the mystery of</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">the Border smugglers.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> Donovan poured a stream of fire into</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">the body of the big ship as they flashed</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">by. Peter turned, banked, and came</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">roaring back to the attack again.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> He noticed the big plane was losing</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">altitude steadily. The ground below,</span>

                        <span type="columnLine"> Again and again he dived and heard</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">steering a wobbly course. He refused</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">the offer of a sampan, fell overboard</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">and decided to swim out to the plane.</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">crawled out over the left wing. McGill</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">was watching him out of the corner of</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">his eye. Gales turned, the wind drum-</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">ming in his ears and clattering his</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">clothes. He waved a hand and grinned</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">recklessly. McGill waved back and</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">grinned too. These men had long ago</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">learned to cover their inner emotions</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">with a brazen, hard-boiled grin.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> Then — suddenly — Gales was off,</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">dropping plummet-like. A small bit of</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">white ballooned out and an instant later</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">the big parachute sprang open with a</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">boom.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> McGill was circling the yacht again</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">and watching the descent of his partner.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">He grinned and spat sharply and</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">climbed high up into the cloudy, windy</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">sky.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> Gales swung pendulum-like as he</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">drifted down toward the creaming</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">water. He kept up this motion, swing-</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">ing his body back and forth so that when</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">lie landed the spread of the parachute</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">would not envelop him. He struck well</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">ofT the lee bow of the yacht and fought</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">clear of the parachute, unfastening the</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">straps with one hand while he swam</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">with the other.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> Free, he began swimming in a world</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">of flying sea-spray and vaguely was</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">aware that the yacht had altered her</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">course and was bearing down to pick</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">him up. Two seaman w'ere standing in</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">the lee bow—Malays, they were, scantily</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">clad. The yacht drew closer, and one of</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">the Malays braced himself to heave a</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">line. Then the line snaked out and</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">Gales grabbed at it, caught it in one</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">hand and hung on grimly.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> The first thing he did when he was</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">hauled on deck was to look up and wave</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">toward McGill who was still circling</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">the craft. Then the plane spiraled</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">downward, well astern of the yacht,</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">straightened out and roared by. McGill</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">flung up an arm as he passed and then</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">zoomed away, heading north.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> A moment later Gales was confronted</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">by a short, stocky, blowzy-faced man</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">who wore the braid of rank.</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">seemed out of control.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> Stevens glanced back and through the</span>

                        <span type="columnLine"> The plane, they knew, was running</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">up they could see Twombly in the pit of</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">the other ship, head hanging forward,</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">to death on the earth below. The credit</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">for his still being in the sky was due to</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">the wing. His hands still clung to the</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">strut. Stevens grew frigid. The under</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">Stevens gently swung over; and Fare-</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">ton whirled off, falling astride the tail</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">and punching his fingers through the</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">linen for a hold.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> Stevens frantically banked his plane</span>

                        <span type="columnLine"> Fareton crawled rapidly up the tail</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">of Twombly's crate, and fell inside the</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">cockpit. Sitting on Twombly's lap,</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">grotesquely high, he shot on the gas</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">and the plane bored ahead steadily.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> As Stevens arched to the other</span>

                        <span type="columnLine"> Stevens was too shaken to question.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">Gladly he complied; he banked right</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">and bee-lined.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> As Twombly's plane eased down</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">again, Fareton strove to get himself in a</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">position whereby he could work the</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">stick more easily. Having done this he</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">tried to arouse Twombly. But Twom-</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">bly was not to be aroused. The man</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">was as though dead.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> Fareton leveled off again and headed</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">into the wind.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> Fareton's compass straightened him.</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">for the plane, Stevens' own D.H. was</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">almost out of sight. Taking it easy,</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">Fareton throttled back.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> Now an avalanche of emotion, in con-</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">before in his life and he had no desire</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">to repeat it. His one wish, now that he</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">was steadied agrftn, was to get back to</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">his tent and take a rest.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine"> The ironic thought struck him that</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">2,000 feet I went into my first loop.</span>
