The villa on the top of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain commanded a vision of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley, vine-clad and cottage-studded. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an irregular bowl of green, dotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with stone houses which were white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed to almost painful brilliancy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The valley was three and a third miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">at its greatest width.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a marble Cupid spurting water in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a most peculiar way into a wall basin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I smiled and commented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is one like that in Brussels and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   386</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">another in Madrid.

So, I wrote a</seg><seg type="columnLine">check, took his bill of sale and became</seg><seg type="columnLine">the owner of a mountain, topped by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone house that seemed to be half ruin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he did not know, and I did not tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that I considered the fountain alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth the price that I had paid. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had come to Italy to buy that fountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I could; buy it and take it back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">America with me. I knew all about that</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious piece of marble. George Sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brook had written to me about it. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">one letter, and then he had gone on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">goodness knows where. George was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, always on the move. Now I owned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fountain and was already planning</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I should place it in my New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. Certainly not in the rose garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat down on a marble bench and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down on die valley.

The surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mountains were high enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw a constant shadow on some part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the valley except at high noon. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no sign of life, but I was sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vineyards were alive with husband-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and their families.

I asked in English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They simply smiled and waved their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hands.

They came and bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrote on the wall and left, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">my real-estate friend sold the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. A fine racket!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Downstairs, outdoors, under the grape-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vine, eating a good Italian meal, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wonderful view, I came to laugh at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my suspicions. I ate spaghetti, olives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark bread and wine. Silence hung heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily over the sullen sleepy afternoon. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky became copper-colored. It was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rain. The old man came and showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a place to put my car, a recess in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the house, open at one end, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheltered from the weather. The stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor was black with grease; more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">one automobile had been kept there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Other cars have been here," I ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All the masters had cars," the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Back on the stone gallery I waited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storm to break. At last it came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a solid wall of gray wetness across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley. Nearer and nearer it came till it</seg><seg type="columnLine">deluged my villa and drove me inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman was lighting candles. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took one from her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to look through the house," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She made no protest; so I started ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploring the first floor. One room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently the sleeping-quarters- for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">servants; another was the kitchen, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remaining two might have served in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the olds days for dining-room and draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-room. There was little furniture, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls were gray with time and mold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One flight of stone stairs led upward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bedroom, another to the cellar. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to go downstairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The)' were steps, not made of masonry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but apparently carved out of the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock. The cellar was simply a cubical</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole in the mountain. It all looked very;</seg><seg type="columnLine">TIGER CAT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">389</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">old. I had the uneasy feeling that orig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inal! y that cellar had been a tomb and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that later the house had been built over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. But, once at the bottom, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to indicate a sepulcher. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">small casks of wine, some junk, odds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope and rusty iron, those were in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners; otherwise, the room was empty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dusty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''It is an odd room," I commented to</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. It seemed in some way out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">place and out of shape and size for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">villa above it. I had expected something</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, something larger, gloomier. Walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around, I examined the walls, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then something came to my alert senses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three sides of the room were carved</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of rock, but the remaining side was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of masonry, and in that side there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. A door! And why should a door</seg><seg type="columnLine">be there except to lead to another room?</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a door, and that presupposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">something on the other side. And what</seg><seg type="columnLine">a door it was! More of a barricade dian</seg><seg type="columnLine">a partition. The iron hinges were built</seg><seg type="columnLine">to support weight and give complete de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fense and support. There was a keyhole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if the key corresponded with the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hole, it was the largest that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever heard of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Naturally, I wanted to open the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As master of the villa, I had a right to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upstairs the old woman seemed unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand me and ended by telling me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see her husband. He, in turn, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">incapable of following my stream of talk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last, I took him to the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to the keyhole. In English, Ital-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian and sign language I told him rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphatically that I wanted the key to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that door. At last he was willing to admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he understood my questions. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head. He had never had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">key to that door. Yes, he knew that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was such a door, but he had never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other side. It was very old. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps his ancestors understood about it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but they were all dead. lie made me</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired, so much so that I rested by placing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand on the butt of the upper hinge. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that he was deceiving -me. Lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">there all his life and never saw the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">open!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you have no key to that door?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I repeated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. I have no key."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who has the key?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The owner of the house."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I own it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, you are the master; but I mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one who owns it all the time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So, the various masters do not really</seg><seg type="columnLine">buy the place?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They buy it, but they come and go."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But the owner keeps on selling it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">owning it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Must be a profitable business.

I told the man that I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be back by supper, and I went to my bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room to change, preparatory to making an</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon call.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the room I found my hand black</seg><seg type="columnLine">with oil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that told me a good many things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was the hand that had rested against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper hinge of the door. I washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand, changed my clothes and drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">my car to Sorona.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fortunately, the Donna Marchesi</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at home. I might have met her</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, but I now saw her ethereal beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time. A least, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ethereal at the first moment. In some</seg><seg type="columnLine">590</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ways she was the most beautiful woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had ever seen: skin white as milk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair a tawny red, piled in great masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her head, and eyes of a peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">green, with pupils that were slots instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of circles. She wore her nails long, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were tinted red to match the Titian</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her hair. She seemed surprized to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">me call on her, and more surprized to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear of my errand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You bought the villa?'1 she asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes. Though, when I bought it, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know that you were the owrner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The agent never stated whom he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know," she said with a smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Franco is peculiar that way. He always</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretends that he owns the place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No doubt he has used it more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I fear so. The place seems to be un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunate. I sell it with a reserve clause.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The owner must live there. And no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to want to stay; so the place reverts</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems to be an old place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very old. It has been in my family</seg><seg type="columnLine">for generations. I have tried to get rid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, but what can I do when the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">men w'ill not stay?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shrugged her shoulders expressive-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. I countered with,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps if they knew, as I do, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you owned the property, they would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">content to stay, for ever, in Sorona."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Prettily said," she answered. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room became silent, and I heard her</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy breathing, like the deep purr of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They come and go," she said at last.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And, when they go, you sell to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Naturally, and with the hope that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one will stay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have come for the key," I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluntly, "the key to the cellar door."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you sure you want it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Absolutely! It is my villa and my cel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar and my door. I want the key. I w'ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see what is on the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then it was that I saw the pupils</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her eyes narrow to livid slits. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at me for a second, for five, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then opening a drawer in a cabinet near</seg><seg type="columnLine">her chair, she took out the key and</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed it to me. It was a tool worthy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door that it was supposed to open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being fully eight inches long and a pound</seg><seg type="columnLine">in weight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking it, I thanked her and said good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bye. Fifteen minutes later I was back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">profuse in my apologies: I was tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental, I explained, and I frequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed my mind. Whatever was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side of the door could stay there, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as I was concerned. Then again I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kissed her hand farewell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the side street I passed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door of a locksmidi and waited W'hile</seg><seg type="columnLine">he completed a key. He was following a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wax impression of the original key. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour later I was on the way back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">villa, with the key in my pocket, a key</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was sure would unlock the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was confident that the lady with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cat eyes felt sure that I had lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">all interest in that door and what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The full moon was just appearing over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains when I drove my car up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the villa. I was tired, but happy. Taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the candlestick in my hand, which candle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick was handed to me with a deep bow</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the old woman, I ascended the stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my bedroom. And soon I was fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I awoke with a start. The moon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still shining. It was midnight. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard, or thought I heard, a deep moan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. It sounded a little like waves beat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on a rockbound coast. Then it ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">and w-as replaced by a musical element</seg><seg type="columnLine">TIGER CAT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">391</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that came in certain stately measures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those sounds were in the room, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from far away; only by straining my</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of sound to the utmost could I hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slippers on my feet, flashlight in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and the key in the pocket of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressing-gown, I slowly descended the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs. Loud snores from the servants'</seg><seg type="columnLine">room told, or seemed to tell, of their deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumbers. Down into the cellar I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put the key into the hole of the lock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The key turned easily--no rust there--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the springs and the tumblers had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">well oiled, like the hinges. It was evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent that the door had been used often.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turning the light on the hinges, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had made my hand black with oil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earnestly I damned the servants. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew about the door. They knew what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the other side!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as I was about to open the door I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a woman's voice singing in Italian;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it sounded like a selection from an opera.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was followed by applause, and then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moaning, and one shrill cry, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone had been hurt. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt now as to where the sounds that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard in my room had come from; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come from the other side of the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a mystery there for me to solve.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I was not ready to solve it; so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the key noiselessly, and with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door locked, tiptoed back to my bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There I tried to put two and two to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. They made five, seven, a million</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague admixtures of impossible results,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all filled with weird forebodings. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">never did they make four, and till they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did, I knew the answers to be wrong, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">two and two had to make four.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many changes of masters! One after</seg><seg type="columnLine">another they came and bought and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. A whitewashed wall. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrets were covered with that white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wash? A door in a cellar. And what</seg><seg type="columnLine">deviltry went on behind it? A key and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a well-oiled lock, and servants that knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything. In vain the question came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. What is back of the door? There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no ready answer. But, Donna Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chesi knew! Was it her voice that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard? She knew almost everything about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, but there was one thing that I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she did not. She did not know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could pass through the door and find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out what was on the other side. She did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know that I had a key.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day I pleaded indisposition</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spent most of the hours idling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowsing in my chamber. Not till nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight did I venture down. The serv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants were certainly asleep that time. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">dose of chloral in their wine had attended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the certainty of their slumbers. Fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed, with an automatic in my pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I reached the cellar and opened the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It swung noiselessly on its well-greased</seg><seg type="columnLine">hinges. The darkness on the other side</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the blackness of hell. An indescrib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able odor came to me, a prison smell and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it the soft half sob, half laugh of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping children, dreaming in their sleep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I flashed the light around the room. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'as not a room but a cavern, a cave that</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended far into the distance, the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">supported by stone pillars, set at regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals. As far as my light would</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry I saw the long rows of white</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And to each pillar was bound a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by chains. They were resting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone floor, twenty or more of them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all asleep. Snores, grunts and weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighs came from them, but not a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyelid opened. Even when I flashed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light in their faces their eyes were shut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And those faces sickened me; white</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drawn and filled with the lines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep suffering. All were covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">scars; long, narrow, deep scars, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh and red, others old and dead-white.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last, the sunken eyelids and the inabil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">392</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ity to see my flashlight and respond told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me the nauseating truth. Those men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all blind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A pleasant sight! One blind man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking eternally into the blackness of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, and chained to a pillar of stone--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was bad enough; but multiply that</seg><seg type="columnLine">by twenty! Was it worse? Could it be</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse? Could twenty men suffer more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than one man? And then a thought came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, a terrible, impossible thought, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible that I doubted my logic. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now two and two were beginning to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">four. Could those men be the masters?</seg><seg type="columnLine">They came and bought and left--to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the cellar and stay there!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh! Donna Marchesi!" I whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How about those cat-eyes? If you had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand in this, you are not a woman. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a tiger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought that I understood part of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The latest master came to her for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">key to the cellar, and then, when he once</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through the door he never left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She and her servants were not there to</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome me that night, because she did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not koow that I had a key.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought came to me that perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of those sleeping men was George</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seabrook. He and I used to play tennis</seg><seg type="columnLine">together and we knew each other like</seg><seg type="columnLine">brothers. He had a large scar on the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his right hand; a livid star-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">scar. With that in mind, I walked care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully from sleeping man to sleeping man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at their right hands. And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a right hand with a scar that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped like the one I knew so well. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">that blind man, only a skin-covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeleton, chained to a bed of stone! That</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be my gay young tennis player,</seg><seg type="columnLine">George!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The discovery nauseated me. What did</seg><seg type="columnLine">it mean? What could it mean? If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donna Marchesi was back of all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">misery, what was her motive?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down the long cave-like room I went.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There seemed to be no end to it, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of the columns were surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with empty chains. Only those near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door had their human flies in the trap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the opposite direction the rows of pil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars strctched into a far oblivion. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that at the end there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black mouth of a tunnel, but I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be sure and dared not go that far to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explore the truth. Then, out of that tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel, I heard a voice come, a singing voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slipping my shoes off, I ran back near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and hid as best I could in a dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">recess, back of a far piece of stone. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there in the darkness, my torch out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the handle of the revolver in my hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The singing grew louder and louder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the singer came into view. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was none other than Donna Marchesi!</seg><seg type="columnLine">She carried a lantern in one hand and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">basket in the other. Hanging the lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a nail, she took the basket and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one sleeping man to another. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">each her performance was the same; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened them with a kick in the face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, when they sat up crying with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain, she placed a hard roll of bread in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their blind, trembling, outstretched hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With all fed, there was silence save for</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnawing teeth breaking through the hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">crusts. The poor devils were hungry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">starving slowly to death, and how they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolfed the bread! She laughed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal delight as they cried for more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Standing under the lamp, a lovely devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her decollete dress, she laughed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. I swear I saw her yellow eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dilated in the semi-darkness!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly she gave the command,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up! you dogs, up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Like well-trained animals they rose to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">J their feet, clumsily, but as fast as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could under the handicap of trembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs and heavy chains. Two were slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">in obeying, and those she struck across</seg><seg type="columnLine">TIGER CAT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">393</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the face with a small whip, till they</seg><seg type="columnLine">whined with pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They stood there in silence, twenty odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind men, chained against as many pil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars of stone; and then the woman, stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the middle of them, started to sing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a well-trained voice, but metallic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her high notes had in them the cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a wild animal. No feminine softness</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. She sang from an Italian opera,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I knew that I had heard that song</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. While she sang, her audience</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited silently. At last she finished, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they started to applaud. Shrunken hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat noisily against shrunken hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She seemed to watch them carefully, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she were measuring the degree of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their appreciation. One man did not sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isfy her. She went over and dug into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face with long strokes of those long</seg><seg type="columnLine">red nails until his face was red and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers bloody. And when she finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">her second song that man clapped louder</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any of them. He had learned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She ended by giving them each another</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll and a dipper of water. Then, lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">and basket in her hands, she walked away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disappeared down the tunnel. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind men, crying and cursing in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">impotent rage, sank down on their stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">beds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I went to my friend, and took his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "George! George Seabrook!" I whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat up and cried, "Who calls me?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who is there?"'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him, and he started to cry. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last he became quiet enough to talk to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What he told me, with slight variants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the story of all the men there and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the men who had been there but who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had died. Each man had been master for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day or a week. Each had found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellar door and had come to the Donna</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marchesi for the key. Some had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious and had written their thoughts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the wall of their bedroom. But one</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all had, in the end, found their</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity more than they could resist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had opened the door. On the other side</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been overpowered and chained</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a pillar, and there they had remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">till they died. Some of them lived longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the rest. Smith of Boston had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">there over two years, though he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coughing badly and did not think that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could last much longer. Seabrook told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me their names. They were the best blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of America, with three Englishmen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one Frenchman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And are you all blind?" I whispered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreading the answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. That happens the first night we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are here. She does it with her nails."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And she comes every night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Every night. She feeds us and sings</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us and we applaud. When one of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">dies, she unchains the body, and throws</seg><seg type="columnLine">it down a hole somewhere. She talks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us about that hole sometimes and brags</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she is going to fill it up before she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stops."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But who is helping her?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think it is the real-estate man. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, the old devils upstairs help. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that they must drug us. Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men say that they went to sleep in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their beds and woke, chained to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">posts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My voice trembled as I bent over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered in his ear, "What would you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, George, if she came and sang, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that you were not chained? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other men not chained?

They did not want to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve my story. I gave them names, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">TIGER CAT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">395</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they had to admit that there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiries, but they felt that the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">details were nightmares, resulting from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an over-use of Italian wines. But I in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted that I was not drunk with new</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine. At last, they called in the chief of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the detective bureau. He knew Franco,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the real-estate agent; also the lady in</seg><seg type="columnLine">question. And he had heard something</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the villa; not much, but vague whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will be there Saturday night," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised.

Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard the Donna Marchesi sing to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience that would never hiss her.

They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cut through a link in the chain, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in such a way that the Tiger Cat would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not suspect that they had gained their</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberty. Were they pleased to have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope of freedom? I am not sure, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were delighted at another prospect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next night I doubled the tips to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the old servants. With tears of gratitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their eyes, they thanked me as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">called me their dear master. I put them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep as though they were babies. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wondered at the time if they would ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">recover from the dose of chloral I gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. I did not even bother to tie them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but just tossed them on their beds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At half past ten, automobiles began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive with darkened lights. We had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthy conference, and soon after eleven</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went through the door. I lost no time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in making sure that each of the blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">mice was a free man, but I insisted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they act as though bound till the proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. They were trembling, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not from fear, not that time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back in my hiding-place I w'aited, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon I heard the singing voice. Ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes later the Donna Marchesi had</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lantern hung on the nail. Ah! She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more beautiful that night than I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever seen her. Dressed in filmy white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her beautiful body, lovely hair, long lithe</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs would have bound any man to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">through eternity. She seemed to sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">that beauty, for, after giving out the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply of rolls, she varied her program.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She told her audience how she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed that evening for their special</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure. She described her jewels and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her costume. She almost became grand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iose as she told of her beauty, and, driv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the dagger, she twisted it as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded them that never would they be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to see her, never touch her or kiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hand. All they could do was to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sing, applaud and at last die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of all the terrible things in her life</seg><seg type="columnLine">that little talk to those blind men wfas</seg><seg type="columnLine">the climax.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then she sang. I watched her</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely, and I saw what I suspected. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">sang with her eyes closed. Was she in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancy seeming that she was in an opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house before thousands of spellbound ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirers? Who knows? But ever as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">396</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sang that night her eyes were closed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as she came to a close, waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the usual applause, her eyes were closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She waited in the silence for the clap</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hands. It did not come. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific anger, she whirled to her basket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and readied for her whip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dogs!" she cried. "Have you so soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot your lesson?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then she realized that the twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind men were closing in on her. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were silent, but their outstretched hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were feeling for something that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted very much. Even when her whip</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to cut, they were silent. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">one man touched her. To her credit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no sign of fear. She knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had happened. She must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, but she was not afraid. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">single scream was nothing but the battle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry of the tiger cat going into action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a single cry, and that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. The men reached for what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted in silence. For a while they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all in a struggling group on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, but soon they were all on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. It was simply a mass, and under</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mass was a biting, scratching, fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, dying animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I couldn't stand it. I had planned it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">all, I wanted it all to happen, but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came, I just couldn't stand it. Covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sweat of fear, I ran to the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unlocked it. I swung it open, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the doorway, closed it and locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it again. The men, waiting for me in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellar, looked on with doubt. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were right in thinking that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">tale was an alcoholic one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give me whisky!" I gasped, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes I had recovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Open the door," I ordered. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring the blind men out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One at a time they were brought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kitchen, and identified.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I sat in self-reproachful thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorrowing for the drink that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed, behold, one passed by w'hom I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized. He was my old schoolfellow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paul Dubois, now a priest in holy orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">and attached to the Cathedral of Saint</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He took me to his quarters, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, pious man, and gave me luncheon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was Friday and a fast day, so w^e</seg><seg type="columnLine">fasted.

When we were so filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fasting that we could not eat another</seg><seg type="columnLine">morsel my old friend took me to another</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest, a native of New Orleans whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock of local lore was second only to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous capacity for fine champagne.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morbleu, how I admire that one! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, attend me very carefully, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends.

When this country bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and your army came to occupy the forts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this young girl fell in love with a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer, a Lieutenant Philip Merriweil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tenez, army love in those times was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">different than it is today, it seems.

In her lovesick illness she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had for constant company a slave, an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">mulatress known to most as Maman Dra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gonne, but to Julie simply as grand'tante,</seg><seg type="columnLine">great-aunt. She had nursed our little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Julie at the breast, and all her life she</seg><seg type="columnLine">fostered and attended her. To her little</seg><seg type="columnLine">white 'mams ell e' she was all gentleness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kindness, but to others she was fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">and frightful, for she was a 'conjon</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman,' adept at obeah, the black magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Congo, and among the blacks she</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruled as queen by force of fear, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whites were wont to treat her with re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spect and, it was more than merely whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered, retain her services upon occasion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She could sell protection to the duelist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he who bore her charm would surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquer on the field of honor; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">brewed love-drafts which turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts and heads of the most capricious</seg><seg type="columnLine">coquettes or the most constant wives, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion warranted; by merely staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixedly at someone she could cause him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take sick and die, and--here we com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mence to tread upon our own terrain--</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was said to have the power of chang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to a snake at will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very good.

When poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Julie died of heartbreak it was old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maman Dragonne--the little white one's</seg><seg type="columnLine">grand'tante--who watched beside her</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed. It is said she stood beside her mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tress' coffin and called a curse upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fickle lover; swore he would come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and die beside the body of the sweetheart</seg><seg type="columnLine">he deserted. She also made a prophecy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Julie should have many loves, but her</seg><seg type="columnLine">body should not know corruption nor her</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit rest until she could find one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep his promise and return to her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">words of love upon his lips. Those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed her should die horribly, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">who kept his pledge would bring her</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest and peace.

Then, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strife was done, he went to the grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">banquet tendered to the victors.

From an inner pocket he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a tiny flask of ruby glass and snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">its stopper loose.

That, I was told, was why the</seg><seg type="columnLine">original owners had moved out some</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty years after building the place.

Extrem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ists sometimes said the house was "un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky," but that is as far as even they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">went. What was really beyond dispute</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that a frightful proportion of persons</seg><seg type="columnLine">died there; or more accurately, had died</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, since after some peculiar happen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings over sixty years ago the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become deserted through the sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossibility of renting it. These persons</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not all cut off suddenly by any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause; rather did it seem that their vitality</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'as insidiously sapped, so that each one</seg><seg type="columnLine">died the sooner from whatever tendency</seg><seg type="columnLine">to weakness he may have naturally had.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And those who did not die displayed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">varying degree a type of anemia or con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumption, and sometimes a decline of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental faculties, whidi spoke ill for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">salubriousness of the building. Neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boring houses, it must be added, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely free from the noxious quality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This much I knew before my insistent</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioning led my uncle to show me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes which finally embarked us both on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hideous investigation. In my child-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood the shunned house was vacant, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">barren, gnarled and terrible old trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, queerly pale grass and nightmar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishly misshapen weeds in the high terraced</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard where birds never lingered. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys used to overrun the place, and I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">still recall my youthful terror not only at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morbid strangeness of this sinister</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetation, but at the eldritdi atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">and odor of the dilapidated house, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlocked front door was often entered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">quest of shudders. The small-paned win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows were largely broken, and a name-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less air of desolation hung round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">precarious panelling, shaky interior shut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters, peeling wall-paper, falling plaster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rickety staircases, and sudi fragments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">battered furniture as still remained. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust and cobwebs added their touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fearful; and brave indeed was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy who would voluntarily ascend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder to the attic, a vast raftered length</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted only by small blinking windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the gable ends, and filled with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SHUNNED HOUSE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">421</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">massed wreckage of chests, chairs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning-wheels which infinite years of</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposit had shrouded and festooned into</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous and hellish shapes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But after all, the attic was not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most terrible part of the house. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dank, humid cellar which somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">exerted the strongest repulsion on us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though it was wholly above ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the street side, w'ith only a thin door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and window-pierced brick wall to sep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arate it from the busy sidewalk. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely knew whether to haunt it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectral fascination, or to shun it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sake of our souls and our sanity. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing, the bad odor of the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">was strongest there; and for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, we did not like the white fungous</seg><seg type="columnLine">growths whidi occasionally sprang up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainy summer weather from the hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth floor.

My</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle's carefully compiled record began</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the building of the structure in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1763, and followed the theme with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual amount of detail. The shunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, it seems, was first inhabited by</seg><seg type="columnLine">William Harris and his wife Rhoby Dex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, with their children, Elkanah, bom</seg><seg type="columnLine">in 1755, Abigail, born in 1757, William,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jr., born in 1759, and Ruth, bom in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1761.

After Brown's death</seg><seg type="columnLine">in 1761, the new firm of Nicholas Brown</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&amp;	Company made him master of the brig</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prudence, Providence-built, of 120 tons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus enabling him to erect the new home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead he had desired ever since his mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The site he had chosen--a recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened part of the new' and fashion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able Back Street, which ran along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the hill above crowded Cheap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side--was all that could be wished, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building did justice to the location.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the best that moderate means</seg><seg type="columnLine">could afford, and Harris hastened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move in before the birth of a fifth child</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'hich the family expected. That child,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boy, came in December; but was still-</seg><seg type="columnLine">born.

He died the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next year--a sad year indeed, since it</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked the death of William Harris him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, enfeebled as he was by the climate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Martinique, where his occupation had</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept him for considerable periods during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preceding decade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The widowed Rhoby Harris never re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered from the shock of her husband's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, and the passing of her first-born</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elkanah two years later was the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow to her reason. In 1768 she fell vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tim to a mild form of insanity, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereafter confined to the upper part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house; her elder maiden sister, Mercy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dexter, having moved in to take charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the family. Mercy was a plain, raw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boned woman of great strength; but her</seg><seg type="columnLine">health visibly declined from the time of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her advent. She was greatly devoted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her unfortunate sister, and had an especial</seg><seg type="columnLine">affection for her only surviving nephew</seg><seg type="columnLine">William, who from a sturdy infant had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become a sickly, spindling lad. In this</seg><seg type="columnLine">year the servant Mehitabel died, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other servant, Preserved Smith, left with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out coherent explanation--or at least,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with only some wild tales and a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaint that he disliked the smell of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. For a time Mercy could secure no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more help, since the seven deaths and</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of madness, all occurring within five</seg><seg type="columnLine">years' space, had begun to set in motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body of fireside rumor which later be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came so bizarre. Ultimately, however, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained new servants from out of town;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ann White, a morose woman from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of North Kingstown now set off as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the township of Exeter, arid a capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boston man named Zenas Low.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was Ann White who first gave def-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inite shape to the sinister idle talk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mercy should have known better than to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hire anyone from the Nooseneck Hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, for that remote bit of backwoods</seg><seg type="columnLine">was then, as now, a seat of the most un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable superstitions. As lately as</seg><seg type="columnLine">1892 an Exeter community exhumed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead body and ceremoniously burnt its</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart in order to prevent certain alleged</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitations injurious to the public health</seg><seg type="columnLine">and peace, and one may imagine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of view of the same section in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1768. Ann's tongue was perniciously ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive, and within a few months Mercy</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharged her, filling her place with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faithful and amiable Amazon from New-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port, Maria Robbins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile poor Rhoby Harris, in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">madness, gave voice to dreams and</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginings of the most hideous sort. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">times her screams became insupportable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for long periods she would utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieking horrors which necessitated her</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's temporary residence with his cousin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peleg Harris, in Presbyterian Lane near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new college building. The boy would</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to improve after these visits, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mercy been as wise as she was well-mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, she would have let him live perma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nently with Peleg. Just what Mrs. Harris</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried out in her fits of violence, tradition</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitates to say; or rather, presents such</seg><seg type="columnLine">extravagant accounts that they nullify</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves through sheer absurdity. Cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly it sounds absurd to hear that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman educated only in the rudiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of French often shouted for hours in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coarse and idiomatic form of that lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage, or that the same person, alone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">424</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded, complained wildly of a staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing which bit and chewed at her.

William Harris,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite his scant sixteen years and feeble</seg><seg type="columnLine">constitution, managed to enlist in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Army of Observation under General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greene; and from that time on enjoyed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady rise in health and prestige. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">1780, as a captain in the Rhode Island</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces in New Jersey under Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angell, he met and married Phebe Het-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field of Elizabethtown, whom he brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Providence upon his honorable dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge in the following year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young soldier's return was not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of unmitigated happiness.

But Mercy Dexter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">once robust frame had undergone a sad</seg><seg type="columnLine">and curious decay, so that she was now a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped and pathetic figure w-ith hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice and disconcerting pallor--qualities</seg><seg type="columnLine">shared to a singular degree by the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining servant Maria. In the autumn</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 1782 Phebe Harris gave birth to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">still-born daughter, and on the fifteenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the next May Mercy Dexter took leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a useful, austere, and virtuous life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> William Harris, at last thoroughly con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced of the radically unhealthful nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his abode, now took steps toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">quitting it and closing it for ever. Secur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing temporary quarters for himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife at the newly opened Golden Ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inn, he arranged for the building of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new and finer house in Westminster</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street, in the growing part of the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the Great Bridge. There, in 1785,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his son Dutee was born; and there the</seg><seg type="columnLine">family dwelt till the encroachments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">commerce drove them back across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river and over the hill to Angell Street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the newer East Side residence district,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the late Archer Harris built his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumptuous but hideous French-roofed</seg><seg type="columnLine">mansion in 1876. William and Phebe</seg><seg type="columnLine">both succumbed to the yellow fever epi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demic of 1797, but Dutee was brought up</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his cousin Rathbone Harris, Peleg's</seg><seg type="columnLine">son.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rathbone was a practical man, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rented the Benefit Street house despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">William's wish to keep it vacant.

It is likely that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt only vexation when, in 1804, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town council ordered him to fumigate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place with sulfur, tar, and gum camphor</seg><seg type="columnLine">on account of the much-discussed deaths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of four persons, presumably caused by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the then diminishing fever epidemic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They said the place had a febrile smell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dutee himself thought little of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, for he grew up to be a privateers-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and served with distinction on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vigilant under Captain Cahoone in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">War of 1812. He returned unharmed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">married in 1814, and became a father on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that memorable night of September 23,</seg><seg type="columnLine">1815, when a great gale drove the waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bay over half the town, and floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tall sloop well up Westminster Street</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that its masts almost tapped the Harris</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows in symbolic affirmation that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new boy, Welcome, was a seaman's son.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Welcome did not survive his father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but lived to perish gloriously at Fred-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ericksburg in 1862.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression was confirmed by my uncle's</seg><seg type="columnLine">less systematic array of miscellaneous data</seg><seg type="columnLine">--legends transcribed from servant gos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sip, cuttings from die papers, copies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death certificates by fellow-physicians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the like. All of this material I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope to give, for my uncle was a tireless</seg><seg type="columnLine">antiquarian and very deeply interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shunned house; but I may refer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">several dominant points which earn notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">by their recurrence through many reports</seg><seg type="columnLine">from diverse sources. For example, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant gossip was practically unanimous</seg><seg type="columnLine">in attributing to the fungous and mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">odorous cellar of the house a vast su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">premacy in evil influence. There had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">servants--Ann White especially--who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not use the cellar kitchen, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least three well-defined legends bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the queer quasi-human or diabolic</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlines assumed by tree-roots and</seg><seg type="columnLine">patches of mold in that region. These</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">latter narratives interested me profoundly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on account of what I had seen in my boy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood, but I felt that most of the signifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cance had in each case been largely ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scured by additions from the common</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock of local ghost lore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ann White, with her Exeter supersti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, had promulgated the most extrava-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gant and at the same time most consistent</seg><seg type="columnLine">tale; alleging that there must lie buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the house one of those vampires</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the dead who retain their bodily form</seg><seg type="columnLine">and live on the blood or breath of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">living--whose hideous legions send their</seg><seg type="columnLine">preying shapes or spirits abroad by night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To destroy a vampire one must, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandmothers say, exhume it and burn its</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, or at least drive a stake through</seg><seg type="columnLine">that organ; and Ann's dogged insistence</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a search under the cellar had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominent in bringing about her dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her tales, however, commanded a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience, and were the more readily ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted because the house indeed stood on</seg><seg type="columnLine">land once used for burial purposes. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">me their interest depended less on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstance than on the peculiarly ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">propriate way in which they dovetailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with certain other things--the complaint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the departing servant Preserved Smith,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had preceded Ann and never heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her, that something "sucked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath" at night; the death-certificates of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fever victims of 1804, issued by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Chad Hopkins, and showing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four deceased persons all unaccountably</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacking in blood; and the obscure pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sages of poor Rhoby Harris's ravings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where she complained of the sharp teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a glassy-eyed, half-visible presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Free from unwarranted superstitition</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I am, these things produced in</seg><seg type="columnLine">me an odd sensation, which was intensi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied by a pair of widely separated news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper cuttings relating to deaths in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shunned house--one from the Providence</seg><seg type="columnLine">426</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Gazette and Country-]ournal of April</seg><seg type="columnLine">12, 1815, and the other from the Daily</seg><seg type="columnLine">Transcript and Chronicle of October 27,</seg><seg type="columnLine">1845--each of which detailed an ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pallingly grisly circumstance whose dupli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation was remarkable. It seems that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">both instances the dying person, in 1815</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gentle old lady named Stafford and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1845 a schoolteacher of middle age</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Eleazar Durfee, became trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured in a horrible way, glaring glassily</seg><seg type="columnLine">and attempting to bite the throat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attending physician. Even more puzzling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, was the final case which put an</seg><seg type="columnLine">end to the renting of the house--a scries</seg><seg type="columnLine">of anemia deaths preceded by progressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">madnesses wherein the patient would</seg><seg type="columnLine">craftily attempt the lives of his relatives</seg><seg type="columnLine">by incisions in the neck or wrist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was in I860 and 1861, when my</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle had just begun his medical prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tise; and before leaving for the front he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard much of it from his elder profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional colleagues. The really inexplicable</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was the way in which the victims--</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorant people, for the ill-smelling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">widely shunned house could now be</seg><seg type="columnLine">rented to no others -- would babble</seg><seg type="columnLine">maledictions in French, a language they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not possibly have studied to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent. It made one think of poor Rhoby</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harris nearly a century before, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved my uncle that he commenced col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lecting historical data on the house after</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening, some time subsequent to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">return from the war, to the first-hand ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of Doctors Chase and Whitmarsh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indeed, I could see that my uncle had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought deeply on the subject, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was glad of my own interest--an</seg><seg type="columnLine">open-minded and sympathetic interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">which enabled him to discuss with me</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters at which others would merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">have laughed. His fancy had not gone so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as mine, but he felt that the place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rare in its imaginative potentialities, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy of note as an inspiration in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field of the grotesque and macabre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For my part, I wras disposed to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole subject with profound seriousness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began at once not only to review the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence, but to accumulate as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more as I could. I talked with the elderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Archer Harris, then owner of the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">many times before his death in 1916; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained from him and his still surviving</seg><seg type="columnLine">maiden sister Alice an authentic corro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boration of all the family data my uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">had collectcd. When, however, I asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">them what connection with France or its</seg><seg type="columnLine">language the house could have, they con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessed themselves as frankly baffled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorant as I. Archer knew nothing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that Miss Harris could say was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old allusion her grandfather, Dutee</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harris, had heard of might have shed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little light. The old seaman, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">survived his son Welcome's death in bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle by two years, had not himself known</seg><seg type="columnLine">the legend, but recalled that his earliest</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurse, the ancient Maria Robbins, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkly aware of something that might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have lent a weird significance to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">French raving of Rhoby Harris, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had so often heard during the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">days of that hapless woman. Maria had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been at the shunned house from 1769 till</seg><seg type="columnLine">the removal of the family in 1783, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen Mercy Dexter die. Once she</seg><seg type="columnLine">hinted to the child Dutee of a somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar circumstance in Mercy's last</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments, but he had soon forgotten all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it save that it was something pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culiar. The granddaughter, moreover, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called even this much with difficulty. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her brother were not so much in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested in the house as was Archer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">son Carrington, the present owner, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrhom I talked after my experience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Having exhausted the Harris family</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the information it could fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nish, I turned my attention to early town</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SHUNNED HOUSE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">427</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> records and deeds with a zeal more pene-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> trating than that which my uncle had oc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> casionally shown in the same work. What</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wished was a comprehensive history of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the site from its very settlement in 1636</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> --or even before, if any Narragansett</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indian legend could be unearthed to sup-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ply the data. I found, at the start, that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the land had been part of the long strip</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of home lot granted originally to John</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throckmorton; one of many similar strips</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> beginning at the Town Street beside the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> river and extending up over the hill to a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> line roughly corresponding with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> modern Hope Street. The Throckmorton</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lot had later, of course, been much sub-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> divided; and I became very assiduous in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tracing that section through which Back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> or Benefit Street was later run. It had, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> rumor indeed said, been the Throck-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> morton graveyard; but as I examined the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> records more carefully, I found that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> graves had all been transferred at an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> early date to the North Burial Ground on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the Pawtucket West Road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Then suddenly I came--by a rare piece</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of chance, since it was not in the main</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> body of records and might easily have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> been missed--upon something which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> aroused my keenest eagerness, fitting in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as it did with several of the queerest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> phases of the affair. It was the record of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a lease, in 1697, of a small tract of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ground to an Etienne Roulet and wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the French element had appeared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> --that, and another deeper element of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> horror which the name conjured up from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the darkest recesses of my weird and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> heterogeneous reading--and I feverishly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> studied the platting of the locality as it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> had been before the cutting through and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> partial straightening of Back Street be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tween 1747 and 1758. I found what I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> had half expected, that where the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> shunned house now stood the Roulets had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> laid out their graveyard behind a one-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> - story and attic cottage, and that no record</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of any transfer of graves existed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">document, indeed, ended in much con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion; and I was forced to ransack both</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Rhode Island Historical Society and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shepley Library before t could find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">local door which the name of Etienne</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roulet would unlock. In the end I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">find something; something of such vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">but monstrous import that I set about at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once to examine the cellar of the shunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">house itself with a new and excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">minuteness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Roulets, it seemed, had come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1696 from East Greenwich, down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west shore of Narragansett Bay. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were Huguenots from Canude, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountered much opposition before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Providence selectmen allowed them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">settle in the town. Unpopularity had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogged them in East Greenwich, whither</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had come in 1686, after the revoca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the Edict of Nantes, and rumor</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that the cause of dislike extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond mere racial and national</seg><seg type="columnLine">prejudice, or the land disputes which in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volved other French settlers with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">English in rivalries which not even Gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernor Andros could quell. But their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ardent Protestantism--too ardent, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered -- and their evident distress</seg><seg type="columnLine">when virtually driven from the village</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the bay, had moved the sympathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the town fathers. Here the strangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been granted a haven; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarthy Etienne Roulet, less apt at agri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culture than at reading queer books and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing queer diagrams, was given a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerical post in the warehouse at Pardon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tillinghast's wharf, far south in Town</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street. There had, however, been a riot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some sort later on--perhaps forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years later, after old Roulet's death--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no one seemed to hear of the family</seg><seg type="columnLine">after that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For a century and more, it appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Roulets had been well remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and frequently discussed as vivid ind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">428</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dents in the quiet life of a New England</seg><seg type="columnLine">seaport. Etienne's son Paul, a surly fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low whose erratic conduct had probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">provoked the riot which wiped out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">family, was particularly a source of specu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation; and though Providence never</seg><seg type="columnLine">shared the witchcraft panics of her Puri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tan neighbors, it was freely intimated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">old wives that his prayers were neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered at the proper time nor directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the proper object. All this had</seg><seg type="columnLine">undoubtedly formed the basis of the leg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">end known by old Maria Robbins. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">relation it had to the French ravings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rhoby Harris and other inhabitants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shunned house, imagination or fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture discovery alone could determine. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered how many of those who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known the legends realized that addi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional link with the terrible which my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wider reading had given me; that om-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inous item in the annals of morbid horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiich tells of the creature Jacques</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roulet, of Caude, who in 1598 was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demned to death as a demoniac but after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward saved from the stake by the Paris</seg><seg type="columnLine">parliament and shut in a madhouse. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been found covered with blood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shreds of flesh in a wood, shortly after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the killing and rending of a boy by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of wolves. One wolf wras seen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lope away unhurt. Surely a pretty hearth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side tale, with a queer significance as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">name and place; but I decided that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Providence gossips could not have gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally known of it. Had they known, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coincidence of names would have brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">some drastic and frightened action--in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, might not its limited whispering</seg><seg type="columnLine">have precipitated the finaL riot which</seg><seg type="columnLine">erased the Roulets from the town?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I now visited the accursed place with</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased frequency; studying the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholesome vegetation of the garden, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amining all the walls of the building,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and poring over every inch of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">earthen cellar floor. Finally, with Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rington Harris's permission, I fitted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">key to the disused door opening from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellar directly upon Benefit Street, pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferring to have a more immediate'access</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the outside world than the dark stairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground-floor hall, and front door could</seg><seg type="columnLine">give. There, w'here morbidity lurked most</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly, I searched and poked during</seg><seg type="columnLine">long afternoons when the sunlight filtered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in through the cobwebbed above-ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows, and a sense of security glowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the unlocked door which placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me only a few feet from the placid side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk outside. Nodiing new rewarded my</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts--only the same depressing musti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and faint suggestions of noxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">odors and nitrous outlines on the floor--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I fancy diat many pedestrians must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have watched me curiously through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken panes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length, upon a suggestion of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle's, I decided to try the spot noctur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nally; and one stormy midnight ran die</seg><seg type="columnLine">beams of an electric torch over the moldy</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor with its uncanny shapes and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted, half-phosphorescent fungi. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">place had dispirited me curiously that</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening, and I was almost prepared when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw--or thought I saw--amidst the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitish deposits a particularly sharp defi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nition of die "huddled form" I had sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected from boyhood. Its clearness was</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishing and unprecedented--and as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched I seemed to see again the thin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellowish, shimmering exhalation which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had startled me on that rainy afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">so many years before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above the anthropomorphic patch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mold by the fireplace it rose; a subtle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickish, almost luminous vapor which as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it hung trembling in the dampness</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to develop vague and shocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestions of form, gradually trailing off</seg><seg type="columnLine">into nebulous decay and passing up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blackness of the great chimney with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fetor in its wake. It was truly horrible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SHUNNED HOUSE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">429</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and the more so to me because of what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew of the spot. Refusing to flee, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched it fade--and as I watched I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was in turn watching me greedily</seg><seg type="columnLine">with eyes more imaginable than visible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I told my uncle about it he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly aroused; and after a tense hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reflection, arrived at a definite and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drastic decision. Weighing in his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the importance of the matter, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">significance of our relation to it, he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted that we both test--and if possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy--the horror of the house by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">joint night or nights of aggressive vigil</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that musty and fungus-cursed cellar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">On Wednesday, June 25, 1919,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a proper notification of Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rington Harris which did not include</seg><seg type="columnLine">surmises as to what we expected to find,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my uncle and I conveyed to the shunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">house two camp chairs and a folding</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp cot, together with some scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism of greater weight and intri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cacy. These we placed in the cellar dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the day, screening the windows with</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper and planning to return in the eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning for our first vigil. We had locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door from the cellar to the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor; and having a key to the outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellar door, were prepared to leave our</seg><seg type="columnLine">expensive and delicate apparatus--which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had obtained secretly and at great</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost--as many days as our vigils might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be protracted. It was our design to sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">up together till very late, and then watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">singly till dawn in two-hour stretches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself first and then my companion; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inactive member resting on the cot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The natural leadership with which my</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle procured die instruments from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratories of Brown University and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cranston Street Armory, and instinctively</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumed direction of our venture, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous commentary on the potential</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vitality and resilience of a man of eighty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. Elihu Whipple had lived according</seg><seg type="columnLine">to die hygienic laws he had preached as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a physician, and but for what happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">later would be here in full vigor today.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only two persons suspected what did</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen--Carrington Harris and myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had to tell Harris because he owned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house and deserved to know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone out of it. Then too, we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken to him in advance of our quest;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I felt after my uncle's going that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would understand and assist me in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitally necessary' public explanations. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned very pale, but agreed to help me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and decided that it would now be safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rent the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To declare that we were not nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that rainy night of watching would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">an exaggeration both gross and ridicu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous. We w'ere not, as I have said, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any sense childishly superstitious, but sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">entific study and reflection had taught us</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the known universe of three dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions embraces the merest fraction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole cosmos of substance and energy.

How long it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might require to evoke and extinguish</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing, wre had no notion.

Such was our frame of mind as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we talked--far into the night, till my</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle's growing drowsiness made me re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mind him to lie down for his two-hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something like fear chilled me as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat there in die small hours alone--I say</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, for one who sits by a' sleeper is</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed alone; perhaps more alone dian</seg><seg type="columnLine">he can realize. My uncle breathed heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily, his deep inhalations and exhalations</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied by the rain outside, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">punctuated by another nerve - racking</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of distant dripping water within--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the house was repulsively damp even</seg><seg type="columnLine">in dry weather, and in this storm posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively swamp-like. I studied die loose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">antique masonry of die walls in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungus-light and the feeble rays whidi</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole in from the street tiirough the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screened window; and once, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisome atmosphere of the place seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to sicken me, I opened the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked up and down die street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feasting my eyes on familiar sights and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my nostrils on wholesome air. Still noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing occurred to reward my watching; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I yawned repeatedly, fatigue getting die</seg><seg type="columnLine">better of apprehension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the stirring of my uncle in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep attracted my notice. He had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">restlessly on the cot several times during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter half of the first hour, but now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was breadiing with unusual irregu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larity, occasionally heaving a sigh whidi</seg><seg type="columnLine">held more dian a few of the qualities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a choking moan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned my electric flashlight on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found his face averted; so rising and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing to the other side of the cot, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">again flashed the light to see if he seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any pain. What I saw unnerved me</seg><seg type="columnLine">most surprizingly, considering its relative</seg><seg type="columnLine">triviality. It must have been merely the</seg><seg type="columnLine">association of any odd circumstance with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sinister nature of our location and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission, for surely the drcumstance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in itself frightful or unnatural. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely that my uncle's facial expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, disturbed no doubt by the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">432</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams which our situation prompted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">betrayed considerable agitation, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed not at all characteristic of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His habitual expression was one of kindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and well-bred calm, whereas now a vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ety of emotions seemed struggling within</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. I think, on the whole, that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">this variety which chiefly disturbed me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My uncle, as he gasped and tossed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing perturbation and with eyes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had now started open, seemed not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">but many men, and suggested a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality of alienage from himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">All at once he commenced to mutter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I did not like the look of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and teeth as he spoke. The words</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at first indistinguishable, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">--with a tremendous start--I recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about them which filled me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with icy fear till I recalled the breadth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my uncle's education and the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minable translations he had made from</seg><seg type="columnLine">anthropological and antiquarian articles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Revue des Deux Mondes. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">venerable Elihu Whipple was muttering</seg><seg type="columnLine">in French, and the few phrases I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguish seemed connected with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkest myths he had ever adapted from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the famous Paris magazine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly a perspiration broke out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sleeper's forehead, and he leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly up, half awake. The jumble of</seg><seg type="columnLine">French changed to a cry in English, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hoarse voice shouted excitedly, "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath, my breath!" Then the awakening</seg><seg type="columnLine">became complete, and with a subsidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of facial expression to the normal state</seg><seg type="columnLine">my uncle seized my hand and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">relate a dream whose nucleus of signifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cance I could only surmise with a kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of awe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had, he said, floated off from a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary series of dream-pictures into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene whose strangeness was related to</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing he had ever read. It was of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'orld, and yet not of it--a shadowy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">geometrical confusion in which could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen elements of familiar things in most</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfamiliar and perturbing combinations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a suggestion of queerly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered pictures superimposed one upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">another; an arrangement in which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">essentials of time as well as of space</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed dissolved and mixed in the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">illogical fashion. In this kaleidoscopic</seg><seg type="columnLine">vortex of phantasmal images wrere occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional snap-shots, if one might use the</seg><seg type="columnLine">term, of singular clearness but unaccount-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able heterogeneity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once my uncle thought he lay in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">carelessly dug open pit, with a crowd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry faces framed by straggling locks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and three-cornered hats frowning down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him. Again he seemed to be in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior of a house--an old house, appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently--but the details and inhabitants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were constantly changing, and he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">never be certain of the faces or the furni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, or even of the room itself, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors and windows seemed in just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">great a state of flux as the presumably</seg><seg type="columnLine">more mobile objects. It was queer--</seg><seg type="columnLine">damnably queer--and my uncle spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost sheepishly, as if half expecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be believed, when he declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the strange faces many had un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistakably borne the features of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harris family. And all the while there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a personal sensation of choking, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if some pervasive presence had spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself through his body and sought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">possess itself of his vital processes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shuddered at the thought of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">vital processes, worn as they were by</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighty-one years of continuous function-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, in conflict with unknown forces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the youngest and strongest system</seg><seg type="columnLine">might well be afraid; but in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment reflected that dreams are only</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams, and that these uncomfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions could be, at most, no more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">my uncle's reaction to the investigations</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                    W.

I seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound and gagged, and taunted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoing yells of distant multitudes who</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirsted for my blood.

It was not a strong or</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a fairly strong light; certainly not</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly strong enough to read an average</seg><seg type="columnLine">book by. But it cast a shadow of myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the cot on the floor, and had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellowish, penetrating force that hinted</seg><seg type="columnLine">. W.

For on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears rang the reverberations of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocking scream, while my nostrils re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volted at the stendi which filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. My mind, as alert as my senses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized the gravely unusual; and al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most automatically I leaped up and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to grasp the destructive instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments which we had left trained on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moldy spot before the fireplace. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, I dreaded what I was to see; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scream had been in my uncle's voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I knew not against what menace I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have to defend him and myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet after all, the sight was worse than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had dreaded.

Out of the fungus-ridden</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth steamed up a vaporous corpse-light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow and diseased, which bubbled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapped to a gigantic height in vague out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines half human and half monstrous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which I could see the chimney</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fireplace beyond.

I say that I saw this thing, but it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">only in conscious retrospection that I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely traced its damnable approach to</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. At the time, it was to me only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">seetliing, dimly phosphorescent cloud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungous loathsomeness, enveloping and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolving to an abhorrent plasticity the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one object on which all my attention was</seg><seg type="columnLine">focussed.

In that dim blend of blue and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow the form of my uncle had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced a nauseous liquefaction whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">essence eludes all description, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">whidi there played across his vanishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">face such changes of identity as only</seg><seg type="columnLine">madness can conceive. He was at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">a devil and a multitude, a charnel-house</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a pageant. Lit by the mixed and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain beams, that gelatinous face as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed a dozen--a score--a hundred--</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspects; grinning, as it sank to the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a body that melted like tallow, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caricatured likeness of legions strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet not strange.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw the features of the Harris line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">masculine and feminine, adult and infan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tile, and other features old and young,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coarse and refined, familiar and unfa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar. For a second there flashed a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">degraded counterfeit of a miniature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor mad Rhoby Harris that I had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the School of Design museum, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">another time I thought I caught the raw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boned image of Mercy Dexter as I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called her from a painting in Carring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton Harris's house. It was frightful be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond conception; toward the last, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curious blend of servant and baby</seg><seg type="columnLine">visages flickered close to the fungous floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a pool of greenish grease was</seg><seg type="columnLine">spreading, it seemed as though the shift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing features fought against themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strove to form contours like those â </seg><seg type="columnLine">of my uncle's kindly face. I like to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he existed at that moment, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tried to bid me farewell. It seems to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me I hiccupped a farewell from my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">parched throat as I lurched out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street; a thin stream of grease following</seg><seg type="columnLine">me through the door to the rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drenched sidewalk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The rest is shadowy and monstrous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no one in the soaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, and in all the world there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one I dared tell. I walked aimlessly south</seg><seg type="columnLine">past College Hill and the Athenaeum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">down Hopkins Street, and over the bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the business section where tall build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings seemed to guard me as modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">material things guard the world from</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient and unwholesome wonder. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray dawn unfolded wetly from the east,</seg><seg type="columnLine">silhouetting the archaic hill and its vener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able steeples, and beckoning me to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where my terrible work was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfinished. And in the end I went, wet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatless, and dazed in the morning light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and entered that awful door in Benefit</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street which I had left ajar, and which</seg><seg type="columnLine">still swung cryptically in full sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">early householders to whom I dared not</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The grease was gone, for the moldy</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor was porous. And in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fireplace was no vestige of the giant dou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SHUNNED HOUSE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">435</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bled-up form traced in niter. I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the cot, the chairs, the instruments, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglected hat, and the yellowed straw hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my uncle. Dazedness was uppermost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I could scarcely recall what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream and what was reality. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought trickled back, and I knew that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had witnessed things more horrible than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had dreamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sitting down, I tried to conjecture as</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly as sanity would let me just what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened, and how I might end the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror, if indeed it had been real. Matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed not to be, nor ether, nor any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else conceivable by mortal mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What, then, but some exotic emanation;</seg><seg type="columnLine">some vampirish vapor such as Exeter</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustics tell of as lurking over certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">churchyards? This I felt was the clue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again I looked at the floor before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fireplace where the mold and niter</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken strange forms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In ten minutes my mind was made up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and taking my hat I set out for home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I bathed, ate, and gave by tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone an order for a pickax, a spade, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">military gas-mask, and six carboys of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulfuric acid, all to be delivered the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning at the cellar door of the shunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">house in Benefit Street. After that I tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sleep; and failing, passed the hours in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading and in the composition of inane</seg><seg type="columnLine">verses to counteract my mood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At eleven a. m. the next day I com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced digging. It was sunny weather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was glad of that. I was still alone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for as much as I feared the unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror I sought, there was more fear in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought of telling anybody. Later I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Harris only through sheer necessity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and because he had heard odd tales from</seg><seg type="columnLine">old people which disposed him ever so</seg><seg type="columnLine">little toward belief. As I turned up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinking black earth in front of the fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, my spade causing a viscous yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">ichor to ooze from die white fungi whidi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it severed, I trembled at the dubious</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts of what I might uncover. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrets of inner earth are not good for</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind, and this seemed to me one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My hand shook perceptibly, but still I</seg><seg type="columnLine">delved; after a while standing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">large hole I had made. With the deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening of the hole, which was about six</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet square, the evil smell increased; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I lost all doubt of my imminent contact</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the hellish thing whose emanations</seg><seg type="columnLine">had cursed die house for over a century</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a half. I wondered what it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">look like--what its form and substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be, and how big it might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">waxed through long ages of life-sucking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At length I climbed out of the hole and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispersed the heaped-up dirt, then arrang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the great carboys of acid around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">near two sides, so that when necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might empty them all down the aperture</seg><seg type="columnLine">in quick succession. After that I dumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth only along the other two sides;</seg><seg type="columnLine">working more slowly and donning my</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas-mask as die smell grew. I was nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnerved at my proximity to a nameless</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing at the bottom of a pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly my spade struck something</seg><seg type="columnLine">softer than earth. I shuddered, and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a motion as if to climb out of the hole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was now as deep as my neck. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage returned, and I scraped away</seg><seg type="columnLine">more dirt in the light of the electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">tordi I had provided. The surface I un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered was fishy and glassy--a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">semi-putrid congealed jelly with sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of translucency. I scraped further,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw that it had form. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rift where a part of the substance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded over. The exposed area was huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and roughly cylindrical; like a mammoth</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft blue-white stovepipe doubled in two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its largest part some two feet in diameter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still more I scraped, and then abruptly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">436</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped out of the hole and away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">filthy thing; frantically unstopping and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilting the heavy carboys, and precipitat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their corrosive contents one after an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other down that charnel gulf and upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unthinkable abnormality whose titan</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbow I had seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The blinding maelstrom of greenish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow vapor which surged tempestu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously up from that hole as the floods of</seg><seg type="columnLine">acid descended, will never leave my</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory. All along the hill people tell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yellow day, when virulent and hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible fumes arose from the factory waste</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumped in the Providence River, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how mistaken they are as to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">source. They tell, too, of the hideous</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar which at the same time came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">some disordered water-pipe or gas main</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground--but again I could correct</seg><seg type="columnLine">them if I dared. It was unspeakably</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocking, and I do not see how I lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it. I did faint after emptying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fourth carboy, which I had to handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the fumes had began to penetrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mask; but when I recovered I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the hole was emitting no fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two remaining carboys I emptied</seg><seg type="columnLine">down without particular result, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time I felt it safe to shovel the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the pit.

The dampness was less fetid, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the strange fungi had withered to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of harmless grayish powder which</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew ash-like along the floor. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's nethermost terrors had perished</seg><seg type="columnLine">for ever; and if there be a hell, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">received at last the demon soul of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhallowed thing. And as I patted down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last spadeful of mold, I shed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first of the many tears with which I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid unaffected tribute to my beloved</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle's memory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next spring no more pale grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strange weeds came up in the shunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">house's terraced garden, and shortly after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward Carrington Harris rented the place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is still spectral, but its strangeness</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinates me, and I shall find mixed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my relief a queer regret when it is torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to make way for a tawdry shop or</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulgar apartment building.

As I am the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in complete possession of the facts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it behooves me to give this astounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">information to the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jason Carse was a brilliant and respect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed criminologist, and at the time of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrest he was recognized as one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest students of the modern world, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact which has made his case one of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralleled notoriety. I was his roommate</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the several years we spent in law</seg><seg type="columnLine">school, and, although he shot to the pin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nacle of his branch of jurisprudence while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was left to more prosaic routine, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">never lost the contact which has now be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come so valuable. Our correspondence</seg><seg type="columnLine">was frequent and regular since we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">graduated, and I can say with justifiable</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride that Carse respected my friendship</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as that of any other acquaint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, if not more. It was this intimacy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his personal life which has enabled</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, as friend and confidant, to witness</seg><seg type="columnLine">the revolting atavism which resulted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such outrageous crimes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I obtained my first hazy acquaintance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the crimes three months ago when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I received Carse's letter from Vienna. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had just discovered sensational evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a famous criminal case--one of recur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent human decapitation--and his conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent enthusiasm was so rabid that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid the morbidity of such matters was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to pervert his senses. For sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral years I had become progressively</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of Carse's melancholic attitude, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had often recommended that he take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacation from criminal cases. His indefat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">igable enthusiasm for research was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">against my advice, and he had gone re*</seg><seg type="columnLine">lentlessly ahead to the tragic climax</seg><seg type="columnLine">which my greatest fears could not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined. This letter from Vienna, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager with indomitable il faut travailler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">confirmed my suspicion that Carse had</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended into the depressing rut of</seg><seg type="columnLine">monomania.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he returned to America shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward I crossed the country to spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few days with him, but he was so sickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and irritable that I could do nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheer his spirits. He continually brooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the case he had been investigating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I should have known at that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a dangerous neurotic compul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion stirring in his subconscious mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Less than a week after my departure</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the city the first of the horrific head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting crimes was committed and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual drama got under way. I can re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">call reading the sensational accounts in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newspapers and my anxious fear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fresh display of criminal perversion</seg><seg type="columnLine">would excite Carse into a state nearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysteria. I telegraphed him that same</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, begging his refusal to bother with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case and requesting that he come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit me. His reply was swift and brief;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had already commenced his investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gations of the head-hunting crime and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing on earth could deter him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his set course.

In none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the murders had the victim been as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saulted, but the head had disappeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly for ever.

Carse expressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the belief that the murderer was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip of some inherent savagery, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ghastly murders would continue until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wore himself out by the sheer expen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diture of energy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I reached the city shortly after sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, and at once I felt the awful tension</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had settled upon everyone in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men and women moved furtively, air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port officials and police examined every</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange face with cold and scrutinizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion, and even my taxi-driver, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small mousy man, kept his fear-laden</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark eyes continually reverting to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror as he whirled me through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight evening traffic.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was virtually a stranger as we met, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hallway and shook hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish you'd go to a hotel," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluntly. "I don't want anyone here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I didn't go to a hotel. I told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">flatly that there was no other course open</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me but to stay and take care of him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for obviously he w^asn't taking care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, and his dismissal of the house-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold help had precipitated a needless bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den on his already over-laden shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He needed food, for he w'as thin to ema-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciation, and I made him dress at once and</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompany me to a restaurant where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that he ate a decent meal. I then led</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to the theater, a particularly lively</seg><seg type="columnLine">musical comedy, and kept him in his seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the curtain had fallen. But my ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forts seemed of no avail, as he was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinually depressed and absorbed in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own reflections. That night before retir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing he came to my room and again asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to leave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's for your own good," he said w'ith</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange harshness. "For God's sake be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve what I say!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For the next several days I watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him sink lower and lower into de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spondency of so contagious a nature that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt the insufferable pangs of it myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He worked late at night on the murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases, referring constantly to autopsy pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tocols and police memoranda, and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than once I saw him reading his Bible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On several occasions he visited the county</seg><seg type="columnLine">morgue and examined the remains of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Head-hunter's victims, and following</seg><seg type="columnLine">each such visit he lapsed into a state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental and physical agitation that ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted him widiin a few hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nights were almost unbearable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I would lie awake for hours listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mumbles and moans which came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his room, oftentimes distinguishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">such words as "God forbid it! God forbid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it!" and frequently he would scream the</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'Ord "Head-hunter." There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt that Carse had delved too deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">into this case, and that hour by hour he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was descending into the clutch of a dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous neurosis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During my stay w'ith him I engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">several servants, but he discharged them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I w'as unable to reconcile him to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of view. His resentment of my visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">became more acute as the days passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was beginning to fear that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcibly eject me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was easy to explain this increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">irritability, for I myself, as w^ell as every</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul in the city, w-as nen-ously awaiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next prowl of the Head-hunter, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it I recognized more fuel for the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">that wras burning Carse's reason. He wras</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for the fatal Monday night as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man waits for his doom, and each hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">found him closer to a mental attack. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunday afternoon I discovered him in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">room packing my luggage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must go now," he said. "1 ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preciate your interest in me, but now you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must go--you must!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tremor of anxiety in his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly convinced me that he w'as right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but doggedly I clung to my set purpose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save him in spite of himself. I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave him alone in face of the develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments which would occur sometime be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween then and Tuesday morning, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told him so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fool!" he exploded; "I can do noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with you. Stay if you wish--but it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">on your own head!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The irony of that final statement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether intentional or not, is something</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shall remember to my grave. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that Carse meant it literally--on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own head--but I was unable to shake</seg><seg type="columnLine">his words out of my ears, and through-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the night and the following day they</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung about me like a dirge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carse did not sleep at all that Sunday</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE HOMICIDAL DIARY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">441</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">night, but paced up and down in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">study while a fierce, alarming expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardened on his features.

Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral times I saw him bend over a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">book and study it with the intent regard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a disciple, and each time that he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred to a certain page he pounded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist on the desk and cried to himself:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"God forbid!

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets were deserted throughout the day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with but few exceptions the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedestrians were police officers, who now</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled in pairs or squads. The evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers were brutally frank in predicting</seg><seg type="columnLine">that before dawn a sixth headless corpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be discovered, and this expecta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was shared by all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carse was at home all day and refused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to answer the telephone or to allow me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to answer it for him.

He shrugged and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to his study. I watched him for a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">while and saw that he was studying that</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer little book which so deeply affected</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and I again heard him utter those</seg><seg type="columnLine">despairing words: "God ,forbid! God</seg><seg type="columnLine">forbid!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I went to bed at a little after ten and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to sleep, but the city-wide ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement seeped into my room and kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">me tossing from the thrusts of night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mares. At midnight Carse came up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped just outside my door, obviously</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening to determine whether I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep. The silence was uncanny for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment; then I heard a sharp metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">clicking and he went on to his room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After he had closed his door, I swept my</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet aside and went to my own door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carse had locked it from the outside!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I called to him for an explanation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this conduct, but he either didn't hear me</seg><seg type="columnLine">or chose to ignore my requests, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house remained grimly silent. Returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bed, I managed somehow to doze off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At two o'clock I was awakened by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of someone's walking in the hall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. I sat bolt-upright in bed and heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unmistakable approach of footsteps</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming down the corridor from Carse's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedroom. The tread was stealthy and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined, and as it drew closer to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">room I was conscious of a cold mask of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat clinging to my face, because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">footsteps did not sound like those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jason Carse!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The feeling hit me and hit me again</seg><seg type="columnLine">until T was left stunned with the horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. It did not sound like Carse! But</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it was not Carse, who was it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wanted to call out his name, yet I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt, with some indefinable sense, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the treader in the hall was unaware that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was in the house, and for that reason it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not have been Carse. I was afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make an outcry, and I sat stricken with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread as the footsteps went past my door</seg><seg type="columnLine">descending the stairs. A moment later</seg><seg type="columnLine">442</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a noise of cutlery being moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the kitchen, and the front door opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it had come, that strange prescience</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished and I tried to reason out what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had heard.

I sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">for hours on the bed working up a deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mination to shake the truth out of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he returned, but shortly after four</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock my strength ran out of me and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook with fear as I heard that awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghost-like tread ascending the stairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My heart beat wildly when the person</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached my door and twisted the knob to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thought flashed through my head:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thank God the door was locked!

For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment there were no sounds from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intruder, but I did hear a faint tap-tap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tap like that of a liquid falling to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden floor. In a minute the knob was</seg><seg type="columnLine">released and the footsteps continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hall to Carsc's room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Any attempt to explain my thoughts as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sat smoking throughout the night would</seg><seg type="columnLine">only add to the confusion of these rev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">elations.

Then I heard him in the hallway</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on the stairs. I heard the splashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water and the sound of scrubbing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I pounded on the door for him to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me out, but it was not until nearly noon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tiiat he finished his chores and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened my door.

About</seg><seg type="columnLine">six months after it was published I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived a letter from a man who was once</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emil Drukker's personal servant.

He told me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drukker had written each entry while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory of the crime was still fresh in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind.

It was a cruel, Teu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonic head, and I knew that it was Emil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drukker's head hanging in a gallows</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope. Then he smiled at me; a horrible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivid, real smile, and the head vanished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From then on, for how long I cannot say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sat as a spectator and watched the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete action of Drukker's Number One.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw Drukker leave his house and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk down a dark street with no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">illumination than a few scattered electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights.

He first tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk with the woman, but she was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested; so he pulled out the knife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought it sweeping down across her</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. The blood spurted like a foun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain and overran Drukker's hand, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">only laughed and pushed the woman to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, then knelt over her and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan a horrible sawing movement with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knife.

During the trial, as you may re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member, I sought to introduce the diary</seg><seg type="columnLine">as major evidence in support of Carse's</seg><seg type="columnLine">somnambulistic manias, but it was waived</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of court with ridicule and contempt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One must admit that Carse's story' as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told it to me, and as I later reiterated it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the court, was fantastic and highly im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable.

For one thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hypnotic examination by competent state</seg><seg type="columnLine">alienists was completely unsuccessful in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attempt to bring forth his subcon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious knowledge of any of the six mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders. Secondly, Carse was unable, despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">his most intense and willing efforts, to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">construct even the smallest part of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the crimes. His only acquaintance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his own alleged activities was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to him in dreams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A further significant fact, which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">court ignored as irrelevant, was the ghast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly identity of Carse's supposed crimes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">those confessed by Emil Drukker.

This fact alone presupposes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the statement that there was a horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unnatural bondage between Emil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drukker and Jason Carse--the bondage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the diary'!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One night of eadi week for six weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jason Carse was compelled by some un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known power to dream about a murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">confessed and described in Drukker's di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ary.

It seemed as if every article of</seg><seg type="columnLine">furniture was just as I had walked away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from diem, well toward half a century</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. It was raining outside, and I sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone in the gloomy, smoky old place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pondering the sweet and bitter mysteries</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I sat thus, staring out with un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing eyes at the rain which was by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time beating down smartly on the pave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, I became conscious that someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the room was staring at me. I had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that there was anyone else in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LONG ARM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">451</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, low-ceilinged place except the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequious proprietor who had served me</seg><seg type="columnLine">my cigar and coffee. Now I realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who sat in the corner diagonally</seg><seg type="columnLine">across from me was studying me curiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">from over his newspaper. His face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one that I had seen before. Suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">across all the years, I remembered him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in that same moment he rose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came toward me with his hand held out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had been in school together, in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Gymnasium. He had been a strange fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low with few friends, but had enjoyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reputation of being the best student in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his class. But in his last year in the Gym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nasium he had, for what reason I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, excited the animosity of a cantank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erous old professor who had publicly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared that Gustav was not the kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy who should have a Gymnasium di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploma and that he, the professor, was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined never to give him a passing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And she went, too, like the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">452</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grade. My father had admired the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much, and at one juncture when my</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks looked perilously low, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed Gustav to tutor me. Gustav</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been so successful that Father was</seg><seg type="columnLine">delighted and made him a present of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver cigarette case with Gustav's initials</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mine engraved on it. I remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">all this very distinctly as we shook hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I was doing fast thinking, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the life of me I couldn't remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">his strange last name. I had a feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was a very foreign name, Polish</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Croatian or something of the sort. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he mentioned this and that, I fear I</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered him a little absently and inco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">herently. The name was almost there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The syllables flitted tantalizingly just out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my reach. But I was sure the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">began with a B. Wasn't it a Bam- or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ban-something? Ah! I had it. Banaoto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vich!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From that moment the conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">went more easily. I was surprized and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased when Banaotovich drew his silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigarette-case out of his pocket to prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me how highly he thought of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor deceased father. We were soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">launched on a cordial exchange of child-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood memories. Banaotovich seemed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-hearted fellow after all, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered why in my childhood I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never been quite comfortable in his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany. I remembered that other boys of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the group had admitted to me confiden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tially that they were more than a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The longer we talked the more inti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate, the more in the nature of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutual confession, our conversation be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. I admitted to Banaotovich that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hifalutin fashion in which I had left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town to win fame and fortune years be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, had been asinine in the extreme,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that it served me just right to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sneak back unknown and penniless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Banaotovich rejoined that for all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride in his school marks he had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained a person of no importance, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the pot had not die slightest inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of making itself ridiculous by calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">die kettle black. He seemed almost pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully inclined to run himself down. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could feel in his manner a sort of pathetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching out for sympathy and consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation. And it began to seem as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were about to tell me something or ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">me for something. But whatever he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell seemed hard to say, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow in coming over his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Banaotovich ordered two bottles of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy native wine. I drank sparingly of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because it goes to my head. But Banaoto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vich swallowed two or three glassfuls</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hasty succession, and his cheeks grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed. There was a pause. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he leaned across the table toward me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in a hoarse, excited whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Modersohn," he said anxiously, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to make a confession to you--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible confession. It may turn you</seg><seg type="columnLine">against me completely. Maybe you don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to hear it. If you don't, say so, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll go home. But it seems as if I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell somebody about it. It seems as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've got to find somebody who under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands me and can excuse me, or it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill me. Shall I tell you? Shall I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was startled. I was reasonably sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Banaotovich was no criminal, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had lived half a century in his native</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, undisturbed and from all he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me solvent and respected. I had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways known that he was a queer fish, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooding, solitary sort of person, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled myself to listen to some harmless</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of psychopathy which meant nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">except to the unfortunate subject.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear fellow," I said, no doubt a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little patronizingly, "I am sure you</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't anything to confess that will</seg><seg type="columnLine">make you out an outrageous rascal, but if</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LONG ARM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">453:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it will do you any good to tell me your</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubles, I am ready to listen to them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thank you," said Banaotovich in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling voice. "I've done nothing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they can put me behind the bars for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But I--I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared at me sternly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I've done worse things," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemnly, "than some poor fellows that</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been strung up by the neck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked to death!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I laughed, a little nervously. "Tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">your story, if you like," I said, "and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me decide just how black you are. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't a great deal of apprehension.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're all of us poor miserable sinners, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as that's concerned. I could tell you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">things about myself-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Banaotovich was not listening to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all. He had fallen suddenly into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit of black brooding. After a minute or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, he looked up and asked sharply:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do you remember Wolansky?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolansky was the Greek professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had threatened to vote against Bana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">otovich when he was finishing his course</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Gymnasium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," said I. "And I remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">well how he abused you that last year.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If there ever was a cantankerous old</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoundrel, Wolansky was just that identi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal individual!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe," he said absently; then after</seg><seg type="columnLine">another pause:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you remember that Wolansky</seg><seg type="columnLine">died suddenly, just a litle while before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the school year?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded. "I imagine that was a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of good luck for you," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Banaotovich. "If he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived, I should never have had my di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploma. As it was, I finished with honors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If Wolansky hadn't died when he did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd have been ruined.

I had a feeling for years</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his business was a disgrace to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">family, and I made no bones about tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him so. There were ugly scenes. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought several times of leaving home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally, Father told me one day that</seg><seg type="columnLine">since I didn't approve of the way he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">his money, he was doing me the favor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">disinheriting me. I told him that was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right with me, that I'd rather starve than</seg><seg type="columnLine">live on money that was stained with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood of poor debtors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I thought at the time that I meant it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But about that time I had become inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested in a young woman.

But this one appeared to like me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when I made advances to her, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't repel me. I am no connoisseur of</seg><seg type="columnLine">female beauty, but I think she was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually attractive, and at that time I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">half mad about her. Still waters run deep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, she had me under her spell so</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely that I changed my mind about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Father's money.

He was very cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and non-committal. Finally I asked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">outright if he would reconsider his de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision to leave me penniless. He told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was I that had made the decision, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, and that he had no use for wishy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">washy people that changed their minds</seg><seg type="columnLine">like weather-cocks. He was very sarcastic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I lost my temper and answered him back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had a terrible quarrel, and finally he</seg><seg type="columnLine">--he struck me.

The night of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooding that hardened into a devilish</seg><seg type="columnLine">decision, the vision of the long arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing, stretching, crawling--but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far this time, only through two walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and across our own house.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was miserable, and I had a feeling that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she might understand and be brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer to me by sympathy. Now that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of it, I can see that I was an egre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gious idiot, but I discovered long ago that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we aren't rational beings after all.

Perhaps that didn't have much to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it--but I had never been happy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. However that may be, one evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she seemed unusually approachable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had just the same impulse that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I met you here tonight, and I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her about Wolansky and Father. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">pooh-poohed it all just as you did. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was afraid. I could see that.

For a long time she tried to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">cordial and natural in my presence, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a sham and the poor thing couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep it up. Each of us knew as well what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the mind of the other as if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had talked the situation over frankly for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours.

Thar go's Treachery</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Instinct can save itself where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentary delay of reason would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatal.

The wine sang in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">veins and suddenly life seemed wild,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet, thrilling. It was good to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done with die old and outworn things of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world he had known, to sit here with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this company in feast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were a good crowd, he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmly, as he drained the goblet again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were making his men welcome, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">now Mike Shinn was standing up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellowing an Irish song, and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing and applauding. Morrow was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinking heavily, silently, and the lank</seg><seg type="columnLine">Texan had his arm around the girl next</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, and only Blacky Cain's dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">predatory face still remained watchful as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gangster sat there. What the deuce</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Blacky so watchful about?--every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one here was their friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thargo's powerful face had a smile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete friendliness on it. Damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">good scout, Thargo--by heaven, he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men would help Thargo conquer</seg><seg type="columnLine">those superstitious Dordonans! And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl Yala swaying languorously closer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, perfumed white shoulders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">breasts rising out of her red chiton like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great lily, brooding sweetness of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">black eyes making Clark's swimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses reel!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are many men of the outer world as</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard and handsome of face as you, lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">from outside?" she whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That may be," Clark laughed, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">ot this I'm sure--no women of that outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">world are as beautiful as you, princess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her eyes were melting as she swayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer, and slender satin fingers touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twined about his in electrical con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then as he bent unsteadily toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yala, Clark just glimpsed an upward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning flash of her dark eyes, directed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at Thargo. It chilled instantly through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winy haze around Clark's brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danger here! shouted an alarmed voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside him. He realized suddenly how</seg><seg type="columnLine">near he was to intoxication. That wine--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd already tossed off three or four gob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets of it. And Yala was proffering him</seg><seg type="columnLine">another beaker of the black stuff, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wine brings gracious compliments</seg><seg type="columnLine">from you, lord from outside. I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear more--so drink."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark took the goblet. But now his</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-hazy brain raced. Yala was trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get him drunk, that was certain, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the glance he had intercepted, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it was at Thargo's orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless he took the goblet. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he raised it, Clark feigned a far greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazedness than he felt, letting his gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">wander dully, making his tongue thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shouldn't drink any more," he mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered thickly to the leaning princess.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Doesn't take much--to knock me out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you do not wish, surely, to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prive me of further compliments?" Yala's</seg><seg type="columnLine">red, ripe mouth pouted bewitchingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark laughed unsteadily, though in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly he was cold and alert. "Never--</seg><seg type="columnLine">never say no to a lady. Here's to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drained the goblet. The heady wine</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his half-numbed senses spin, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolutely kept his head. Yet he feigned</seg><seg type="columnLine">now a complete intoxication, hurled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass away with a drunken laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yala, I could give you compliments</seg><seg type="columnLine">all night," he said maudlinly. "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">most -- most beautiful woman -- ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As his eyelids pretended to droop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clark caught again that significant glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the girl to her brother. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was leaning, her warm breath whispering</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Would wou rather tell me those</seg><seg type="columnLine">468</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">things where there are not so many to</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen, lord from outside?" she mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, that's what we need --- a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more quiet,'' Clark said sleepily.

"1 will take you where it is quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and where you can tell me all those</seg><seg type="columnLine">things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her soft hand under his elbow im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled him to his feet. Clark swayed un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily, blinking owlishly over the torch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit hall and the noisy, riotous feasters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His dulled gaze was really keenly alert.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He perceived that Shinn and Link Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son were at the height of merriment with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their Red neighbors, and that Morrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still drinking heavily. But Blacky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cain was still alert, could be depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to w-atch the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">None of the feasters, in the din of</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter, clinking goblets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting voices, noticcd as Clark Stan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nard stumbled out of the hall with Yala</seg><seg type="columnLine">half supporting him. Yet Clark glimpsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thargo looking keenly after them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stumbled with the princess of</seg><seg type="columnLine">K'Lamm down shadowy stone halls, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally into a great chamber which</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed of femininity. Silken hangings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yellowf were on the walls, in the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of low-burning torches. Across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was a low, soft silken couch, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">above it a great window looked across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">starlit roofs of K'Lamm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yala spoke a few' soft w'ords, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two submissivc-looking girls who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried forward, hastily withdrew. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red princess led Clark to the coudi, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he sat down unsteadily, looking heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily about, she* poured more of the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine from a flagon in the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She drank also, her dark eyes look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over the rim of the glass with an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression tliat, despite himself, stirred his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">blood. Then she held the glass to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, her fingertips caressing his cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Drink w'ith me to our--friendship,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she murmured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark drank. His brain seemed to float</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside his skull as the additional alcohol</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped into his blood, but every fiber in</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was taut and alert. He blinked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yala as though she was hard for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see. She came temptingly closer to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Does the w'ine make me look--more</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful?" she asked provocatively. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms went softly around his neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't need wine for that," muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clark. He set his lips against her half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened ones, his hands tightening on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare, perfumed shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew the kiss was as feigned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her part as on his ow-n. But for all that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was none the less wildly thrilling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then as she drew back a little from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">embrace, eyes seardiing his dazed-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, Yala asked him seductively:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord, tell me--am I more beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the Dordonan girl you took captive</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Lurain?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Much--much more beautiful," stam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered Clark, his eyelids drooping. "She's</seg><seg type="columnLine">just--little wildcat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Has Lurain asked you and your men</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help Dordona in the coming war?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yala asked him swiftly. "Has she made</seg><seg type="columnLine">any offers to get you to ally yourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Dordona?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, Clark knew suddenly, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered the reason for this subtle</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptation by Yala. Thargo was suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious! Suspicious that Clark might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed with the Dordonan girl to aid her</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, that he might be intending to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tray K'Lamm! Thargo had had this girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one capable of tempting an angel, get</seg><seg type="columnLine">him intoxicated to question him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lurain has not asked me to help Dor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dona," Clark said thickly, his eyes clos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, his body swaying sleepily against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yala. "I--wouldn't listen to her if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAKE OF LIFE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">469</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">did. The Dordonans she led tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill me and my men. We're--going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help Thargo conquer their city."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard the hiss of Yala's indrawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. Then she murmured softly, "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are tired, lord from outside. You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He let himself fall like a log onto the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft couch as she lowered him. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Yala stand up quickly. She bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him as he lay with eyes closed, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath warm on his face. He breathed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">long snores, pretending heavy, drunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Satisfied, Yala went to the door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber and uttered a low call. Almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once, Clark heard the tramp of heavier</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet entering the chamber, two pairs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The first voice that spoke was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thargo's. He guessed the Red king had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been waiting outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You heard?" Yala was saying swiftly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He is safely on our side--he will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to do with Dordona."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I heard," Thargo said. 'T was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious because he would not give up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Dordonan princess to us. But no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt he is keeping the girl for himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply because she is pretty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That half-boy fighting cat!" said Yala</seg><seg type="columnLine">scornfully. "What would any man want</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voice of Thargo's companion in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrupted. It was an age-cracked, ominous</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice Clark guessed to be that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">withered old counsellor he had seen with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thargo when he had first met the Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Better to slay all these strangers to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, by surprize, and make sure," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned. "We of KLamm have more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than enough force to conquer Dordona</seg><seg type="columnLine">and win to the lake. We do not need the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers' help."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, we will not slay them, Shama--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet," Thargo said authoritatively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Their weapons are powerful, from what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dral says. They might kill many of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we slew them all, and that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be bad for the minds of our people at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time when we are on the-very verge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our long-planned attack on Dordona.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, why not make use of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers to make our conquest even</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is what we shall do," he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued in a hard, rapid voice. "Four days</seg><seg type="columnLine">from now, as we have planned, we ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attack Dordona, and the strangers go</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us. In the attack on the Black city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will put them in the forefront. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as we have won Dordona and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">way down to the Lake of Life lies clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and open, then we shall turn suddenly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strangers and kill them all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">S. The Fight at the Gate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all Clark Stannard could do to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep his body from stiffening betray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly as he lay in pretended drunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, listening to those calmly treacher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous words. Blind fury burned in him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard Thargo's callous plan to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of him, then dispose of him. Yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to preserve his appearance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">intoxicated stupor. His muscles tensed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard Thargo's strong step come over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the couch, and he knew that the Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">king was looking down at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This drunken fool!" said Thargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemptuously. "If he is a sample of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men of the outside world, they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be hard for us to rule, once we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk of the lake and are immortal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be not so sure," warned the old coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sellor, Shama. "This man and his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rades have courage and cunning, or they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not have penetrated the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains no men ever came through</seg><seg type="columnLine">before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was not cunning enough," Thargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">said scornfully, "to prevent a woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes from making a sot of him. You did</seg><seg type="columnLine">470</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">well what I asked, my sister. In fact, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">task did not seem distasteful to you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps not," Yala said' with a soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh. "Fool he may be, but this man is</seg><seg type="columnLine">--different. Until he and his men ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">with your forces to Dordona four days</seg><seg type="columnLine">hence, I think to find him amusing.''</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is your affair," Thargo said in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">differently. "Best get him back to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chambers now before his men miss him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shama and I return to the feast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark heard the ruthless plotter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aged counsellor leave. Then Yala</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent over him, holding a pungent liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his nose and shaking him softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wake, lord from outside," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenderly. "You must not stay here longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">--my brother would be angry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark was careful to awake slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinking and rubbing his eyes dazedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"More wine," he muttered thickly. "Got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have more wine--so I can tell you--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">how beautiful you are-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You shall have opportunity for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the next few days," Yala promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a provocative smile. "You had best</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to your chambers now and sleep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nsy lord. It seems that you are almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome by my beauty--or the wine!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She went to the door and called, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clark stumbled to his feet. A warrior in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crimson armor answered quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This soldier will conduct you to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">chambers," Yala told him. "Until to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow, lord from outside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her fingers clung warmly to his in</seg><seg type="columnLine">caressing promise. Clark nodded dazedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and staggered out into the hall. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled with his guide by shadowy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">torchlit corridors, up a stair to the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. The warrior took him to the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their chambers, bowed and left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Clark's apparently owlish gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">took in the fact that now there were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">score of armored guards posted unob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusively along the corridor outside their</seg><seg type="columnLine">chambers. That showed that Thargo was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">still taking no chances--and that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to make things difficult.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ephraim quell looked up in surprize</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Clark stumbled into the torch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit rooms and slammed the door. Quell's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes ran over Clark's disordered hair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed face, and the girl Lurain, sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">taut as a trapped tigress in a chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched with bitter contempt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a Book that says, 'Wine is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocker, strong drink is raging,' "</seg><seg type="columnLine">twanged Quell, his bony face condemna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. "Figger you might ought to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">read that, before you went down there."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm not drunk," Clark rasped. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've found out a lot and it adds up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">total news that our lives are not worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">a plugged nickel if we stay around here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quell jumped to his feet in alarm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Go down and get the others up</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," Clark told him. "Don't appear too</seg><seg type="columnLine">urgent about it--but get them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ephraim Quell nodded tightly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out of the room. Clark Stannard</seg><seg type="columnLine">went rapidly across the room to Lurain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark s mind, racing at top speed ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">since lie had discovered Thargo's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">templated treachery, had hit upon a des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate plan. It was a hazardous one but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only one, as far as he could see, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would give him and his men a chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the Lake of Life now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To stay longer in K'Lamm would</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely allow Thargo to make pawns of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and then kill them.

"I've discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Thargo intends to kill me and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, as soon as we've helped him con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quer your city of Dordona."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am glad!" she blazed. "Now you</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAKE OF LIFE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">471</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">learn the full evil of these Red spawn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They will kill me, but you also will die."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Listen, you and your men came spy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on K'Lamm to learn when Thargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his forces will attack your city, didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?" Clark demanded, heedless of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate. "Well, I can tell you that. Thargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his men will ride toward Dordona</seg><seg type="columnLine">in four days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Four days?" whispered Lurain, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face suddenly going dead w'hite. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we did not dream he would attack so</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon--my people will be surprized--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will overwhelm Dordona!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly," rasped Clark. "He will, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less w'e carry a warning to Dordona."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You mean you strangers will help me</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape, help me warn Dordona?" the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed, with sudden desperate hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will,'' Clark said grimly, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is more, we will fight on the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Dordona in the coming battle. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen how powerful our weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">are--it may be that our help will turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tide against K'Lamm. But, for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, there is a price."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What price, for your aid?" Lurain de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The price," Clark told her, "is this:</seg><seg type="columnLine">that when we reach Dordona, you shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">take me down the pit to the Lake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Life, so that I may fill a flask with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining waters to take back to the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside. For that price, I and my men</seg><seg type="columnLine">will aid your people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" flamed Lurain, leaping erect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face blazing with wrath. "By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, never will I pay that price! Ages on</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages have we of Dordona faidifully</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeyed the commandments given us long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago by the Guardians below. Never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">we permitted one blasphemer to descend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lake. To allow you to do so would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be supreme sacrilege. I reject your pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posal. I would rather die!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Dordona will die too, if it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned," Clark pointed out. 'Yes, all its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> people will perish when Thargo leads the</seg><seg type="columnLine">armies to K'Lamm into the city in sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize attack. And then Thargo will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to descend to the lake and drink of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Guardians are there and will</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy Thargo and liis horde if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare descend," Lurain retorted fiercely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you so sure the Guardians are</seg><seg type="columnLine">there?" Clark said. "Are you sure they</seg><seg type="columnLine">exist? None in your city has seen them</seg><seg type="columnLine">for ages."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Guardians are there!'' Complete,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unshakable faith of generations rang in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's voice. "Though Thargo and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spawn doubt their existence, they exist</seg><seg type="columnLine">and still wrard the sacred lake. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers are vast and they will slay any</seg><seg type="columnLine">who approaches the lake, doubt it not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But then, why not agree to let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">descend to the lake?" Clark pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. "If the Guardians are there, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not let me touch the shining waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway, will they? The blame will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be yours, for you warned me. And by</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreeing to let me go down there, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will save Dordona from surprize and</seg><seg type="columnLine">death."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lurain's face expressed doubt, hesita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, agony for her imperilled city. Clark</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung on her answer. He was hoping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's blind faith in the legended</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guardians of the lake was strong enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that she would agree to let him go,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she supposed, to his death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said finally, her voice low and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken, "It is true that the Guardians</seg><seg type="columnLine">will kill you when you descend to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake. The sin of letting you descend</seg><seg type="columnLine">there will be on my soul. But--Dordona</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be warned in time to prepare for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thargo's attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, I agree," she continued with</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate resolution on her face. "Help</seg><seg type="columnLine">me escape from K'Lamm, promise to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">my city your help in the coming w^ar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when we reach Dordona I will show</seg><seg type="columnLine">472</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you how you may descend the sacred</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!" Clark exclaimed, his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickening with excitement. "Now if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can just get safely out of K'Lamm-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The door opened, and Ephraim Quell</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly entered, followed by Clark's</seg><seg type="columnLine">other four followers. Mike Shinn was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting drunk, bawling a song, his bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered face glistening. Link Wilson too</seg><seg type="columnLine">was flushed with wine, but Lieutenant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morrow and Blacky Cain were sober--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first because the drink had not affected</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, the second from abstinence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What's the lay, chief?" rasped Blacky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Something wrong?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A lot wrong," Clark snapped. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">told them in curt sentences of Thargo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">plot. A vicious oath ripped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gangster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Double-crossing us, eh? We'll go</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and put the blast on him, damn</seg><seg type="columnLine">him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Sure, I'll choke the dirty scut with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me bare hands!" raged Mike Shinn furi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen," Clark rapped, "we'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">all we can do to escape this trap with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out bothering for revenge on Thargo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're going to get out of here, at once--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and join the people of Dordona."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Rapidly he told them of the agreement</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had made with Lurain. The Dordonan</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl stood tense and pale as he talked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It's a great idea!" exclaimed Blacky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The gangster laughed. "We'll hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thargo a double-cross, and when we get</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this other burg, Dordona, we can easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift the water from the lake below."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How are we going to get out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">K'Lamm?" Lieutenant Morrow asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. "How out of this palace, even?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can't go down through the palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself," Clark said emphatically. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards posted out there in the corridor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> would give the alarm. There's the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll have to take out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed to one of the big, open</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows, that looked out across the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">city and the starry sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll slide down from that window</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a rope of some kind," Clark' said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. "Behind the palace I noticed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">court where the horses of the palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards are evidently kept at night. If we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can sneak back there and get mounts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll make a dash out through the city."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's the idea," approved Link Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, his eyes lighting. "We can ride right</seg><seg type="columnLine">out through these kombres."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What if the gates of the city wall are</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed?" Morrow asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark shrugged. 'T don't think they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be. I doubt if they close those gates</seg><seg type="columnLine">every night--this city fears no attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Dordona."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The six adventurers acted rapidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While Ephraim Quell listened watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully at the door, Clark and the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore down the wall hangings and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verted them into heavy, knotted rope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They tied the end of the rope to a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest, then dropped it into the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men quickly shouldered their</seg><seg type="columnLine">packs. Clark peered from the window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were no sentries in the palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard immediately beneath, though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard movement of some at the front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building. The walled courts in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear of the palace were silent except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an occasional stamping of the restless</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses back there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Clark hung for a moment, transfixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the weird beauty of the scene.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The moon was rising above the mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall in the east, a flood of silvery light</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring across the prisoned land. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathed in the moon slept the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">K'Lamm, a sea of dully gleaming roofs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and streets and squares. Solemn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAKE OF LIFE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">473</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">somber bulked the dark mountains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched above die city. Then Clark</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stannard snapped out of the spell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, that moonlight will make</seg><seg type="columnLine">it harder for us," he whispered urgently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lurain, you follow me closely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Stannar," she whispered, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximating as closely as she could the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name she had heard the others call him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark swung over the stone window-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail and slid softly down the knotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope through the moonlight, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. He poised there in the shadow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun in hand. No sound broke the sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Lurain was following, her black</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal-mesh tunic gleaming in the silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon. Mike Shinn and Lieutenant Mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row came after, and in a moment they all</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in the shadow of the looming</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace wall, their pistols glinting in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They moved at once toward the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sleeping palace, stepping sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly on the stone paving. There seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no guards outside the big building.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither were there any outside the broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden door of the walled horse-court.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door creaked, and . they slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were a score of horses in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">court, and as the strangers entered, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals stamped nervously, tossed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads suspiciously in the moonlight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clark's gaze searched the court desper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately. But it was Link Wilson who spot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted the saddles and bridles, hanging on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rail at one side of the court. Quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">they grasped these and approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">restless horses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The horses snorted, stamped, wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with hoofs ringing loudly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paving. Clark cursed inwardly as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">again approached the nervous steeds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Link Wilson talked to the horses in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, soothing monotone as he advanced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ex-cowboy was soon saddling one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, and Morrow too and also Lurain</seg><seg type="columnLine">had got others to stand still. Clark</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that the girl worked as silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swiftly as any of the men, her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing no particle of fear in the silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. His heart warmed again to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud, unwavering courage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got one of the restive horses by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mane, and quickly attached the high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer saddle and the rude bridle. Quell</seg><seg type="columnLine">also managed to saddle one, but Mike</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shinn and Blacky were having the devil's</seg><seg type="columnLine">own time, hanging onto horses that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun to plunge and rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help Mike, Link," whispered Clark</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly to the Texan. As the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeyed, Clark hurried to aid the gang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster, leading his own saddled steed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This damned goat has got the devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in him!" whispered Blacky furi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously as Clark reached him. "I wish we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a good eight-cylinder jaloppy for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">getaway, instead of these plugs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark grabbed the saddle from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gangster and threw it over the plunging,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rearing animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guards!" cried Lurain suddenly, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver voice stabbing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark whirled, still holding the mane</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plunging horse. Two armored</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, attracted by the commotion in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse-court, stood framed in the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened door, staring. Then with a yell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of alarm, drawing their sw'ords, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blacky Cain's automatic sprang into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and with a snarl on his lips, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gangster shot. The reports cracked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">close succession and the two charging</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers fell in heaps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That ties it!" cried the gangster.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now we got to crash our way out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More guards come," called Lurain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">high voice, completely calm and unfear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful but urgent, as she snatched up one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swords of the fallen men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The yell of alarm had been repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">474</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">near the looming palace, and there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clank of running men. Clark Stannard</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought furiously to tie the girths of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling horse. He finally succeeded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he yelled to Blacky Cain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here you are! Mount at once, all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now an uproar was spreading through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole pile of the hexagonal palace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouts and clash of arms could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard from all around it, converging on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horse-court.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark swung into the saddle. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked the reins to control the rearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal, he saw that outside the horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">court a scattered body of twenty or</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty Red guards were rushing forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">with drawn swords gleaming in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll have to break out through</seg><seg type="columnLine">them!" Clark yelled. "Ride!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he dug his heels into his steed's</seg><seg type="columnLine">flanks. The nervous animal needed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">further urging, and sprang forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the door with hoofs clanging on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pavement. Right beside Clark rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">Link Wilson, the Texan sitting easily in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle, the rest thundering after.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Straight into the scattered band of</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards at the door of the court they rode.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clark glimpsed their drawn swords, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the boom of a gun beside him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the din of hoofs and yells. Link</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilson had drawn one of his forty-fives</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was shooting as they charged. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the guards slumped down as the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">slugs hit them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They crashed th rough the other guards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mad whirlwind of riders and steeds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soldiers and stabbing swords seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to spin around them. Then, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftness of a cinema film, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the soldiers, riding full tilt</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the big palace toward the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenue that led to the city wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Other guards ran wildly out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace, swords raised in the moonlight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clark had his own gun out now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired, and heard Link Wilson's pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">booming again. He saw Lurain bending</seg><seg type="columnLine">low over her mount's neck and slashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a guard whose spear struck toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. The man went down and she rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">right over him, and the little band raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">clattering down the wide street of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakening city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The spawn of K'Lamm cannot stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">against us, Stannar!" cried Lurain's silver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pealing voice as she rode.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yippee!" yelled Link Wilson, the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowboy, drunk with reckless excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his horse galloped furiously over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The whole city is rousing!" shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Morrow, spurring his horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside Clark's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They thundered down that wide dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">street to the accompaniment of mad yells</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rage from behind them, and startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries along the street.

Behind that line, a half-dozen other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red warriors were slowly forcing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great valves shut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ride through them!" Clark shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's now or never.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They crashed into that solid line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards--and stopped! For these soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed their bridles and stirrups and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung to them, holding them, stabbing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with their swords. The crazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses whirled and plunged in a mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">inferno of struggle, the riders rising like</seg><seg type="columnLine">swimmers above a wave of armored men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slashing swords.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark felt a blade sear along his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, and glimpsed the brutal face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red warrior stabbing at him. His gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked in his hand and the man fell with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his forehead driven in. Clark shot again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to clear away the men clinging to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bridle. Link Wilson's heavy gun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">booming, while Blacky Cain, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing and a frozen killer mask on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, was viciously shooting the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to pull him down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dordona! Dordona!" pealed a silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry from the girl Lurain, wielding her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword with wildcat swiftness and fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gates were almost closed! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">from far back at the palace of Thargo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of soldiers were coming on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">run. Clark had a cold, sinking sense that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were trapped. Then he heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Out of my way, you scum!" Ephraim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quell shouted, forcing through his at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tackers, clubbing his reversed gun on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quell broke through them. Clark</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the bony Yankee skipper break</seg><seg type="columnLine">through on his mount to the half-dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who now had pushed the gates</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a foot of closing. Ephraim Quell's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun-butt smashed down among them, sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">them reeling, his horse trampling them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Yankee leaped from his horse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly pulled on one of the great valves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pulled it open a few yards, by fren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zied, tremendous effort. But the men he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had scattered were on their feet again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing at him and stabbing with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">swords. Quell reeled back from them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark shouted, his voice ringing over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mad din, and the others heard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed desperately forward. The horses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maddened by the struggle to the pitch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzy, surged forward crazily toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gate-opening that promised freedom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trampling down the clinging guards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark's gun blazed the last of its clip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the men stabbing at Quell fell. Link</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilson spurred in, grabbed the Yankee</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper's horse, helped haul the bony</seg><seg type="columnLine">seaman up onto it. Then before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards they had broken through could</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach them again, their horses were bolt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out through the opened gates. Wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the battle and unaccustomed gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, they plunged for freedom, Clark's</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Lurain's steeds jamming momentarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the narrow opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they were all out in the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight of the plain, the dark walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and confusion and raging shouts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">K'Lamm behind them. Plunging, racing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snorting, the horses galloped wildly over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moonlit sea of grass and brush. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild uproar of the Red city receded</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Which way to Dordona?" cried Clark</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Lurain, shouting to her over the rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We follow the way now," she cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Due east from here it lies--we go to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, and along it to my city."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the horses were settling to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">.476</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">steady, rushing lope as their frenzy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic quieted a little. Clark turned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle, but there was no sign of pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit as yet from K'Lamm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But none of them had escaped un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scathed. Mike Shinn had a bleeding cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his forehead; Blacky Cain had one</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeve slashed to ribbons; the rest all had</seg><seg type="columnLine">small cut or stab wounds. Only Ephraim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quell, riding grimly forward with jacket</seg><seg type="columnLine">buttoned tightly against the wind, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to have escaped without injury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark leaned toward the Dordonan</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl riding close beside him. Lurain had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cut across one bare knee, but it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious. As they galloped, she looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">tautly back to where K'Lamm had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped from sight in the moonlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They will try to follow but they can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not trail us by night, and they dare not</seg><seg type="columnLine">go too close to Dordona in small parties,''</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said. Then she laughed. "I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to see Thargo's face now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ahead in the dim moonlight there soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed vaguely a long, low line of dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. It marked the river, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached it in a quarter-hour. The dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of the stream was loud, as it raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the swiftness of a mountain-flume</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Dordona.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As they rode along it, heading east, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first gray streak of dawn showed ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clark's hopes were soaring. Every beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hoofs brought them nearer to Dor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dona, where lay the pit that was entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Lake of Life. He'd yet succeed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching it--lie had the girl's word now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could descend to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ephraim quell suddenly toppled</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffly from his horse. They reined in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily and Clark ran to the Yankee's</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Quell's bony face was a ghastly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff mask, his eyes closed. From under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his coat welled a dark stain, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clark ripped the coat open, he saw that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath it had been concealed two deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword-wounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God! Quell was badly wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he kept the gate from closing, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie said nothing to us!" Clark exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ephraim Quells glazed eyes flickered</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Clark's drawn, tense countenance. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile glimmered in them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm--'bout ready to cast anchor,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quell muttered. "Felt the life running</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of me, as I rode-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quell, you're not dying!" Clark said</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately. "We'll get you to Dordona,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pull you through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I'm done for," whispered the sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. "And--I don't mind. Ever since</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ship burned and they took my certifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate, I--haven't cared much about liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His glazed eyes fixed on the eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, pale with dawn. A cool breeze had</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun to blow from there, stirring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass. The Yankee skipper's lips moved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost inaudibly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fair skies and a good wind -- to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day-" he whispered. Then his head</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lolled laxly, his eyes dull, dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark let him down and got to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a hard lump in his throat but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he made his voice harsh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mike--Blacky--keep a watch to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south and west. Link and Morrow and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will bury him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the paling dawn, they scooped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave under a tree beside the roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, using a little camp-spade from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the packs. White mists of morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">made everything unreal as they put Ephra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">im Quell's stiff body into the shallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave, and covered it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mount! Forward!'' Clark ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again they galloped, hoofs thudding</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the river roar, bearing them on</seg><seg type="columnLine">through swirling white mists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm kind of glad," said Link Wilson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawling voice finally, "that we buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">him where he can hear water.''</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAKE OF LIFE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">477</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah," muttered Mike Shinn. "Quell</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a good guy. He was a great guy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later, Lurain suddenly reined</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her horse and pointed eagerly ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is Dordona!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five miles ahead rose the eastern wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great crater, the mighty, looming</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier of the mountains. Close under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowning cliffs brooded ancient, crum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling Dordona. Black, silent, brooding</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a withered ancient who has long ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen from greatness, it lay in the chill</seg><seg type="columnLine">white mists, strange contrast to the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which they had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind the black battlements of an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling w'all whose top had crumbled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">places, rose a mass of antique towers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">roofs of dull black stone, weathered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winds and rains of ages. Under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-gate in the dilapidated wall ran the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring, mill-race river they had fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed. It ran straight toward a building</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the center of the city, a huge black</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome that towered two hundred feet into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gates in the black wall were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed open as they approached. Soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in black armor waved their swords in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and yelled joyful greetings to Lurain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding now at the head of the little troop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as they rode on into the city, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">somber, crumbling buildings poured men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women w'ith shouts of gladness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lurain! The princess Lurain has re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned!" they shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark Stannard, looking about keenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that indeed Dordona had long passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the zenith of its glory'. Many of the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone buildings w'ere untenanted, falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ruins. Green grass grew between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks of black paving in the streets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the people pouring forth were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly so numerous as the Reds, he saw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clark sensed despair under their momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary joy, read hopelessness on their pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces, the hopelessness of great fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, we'll be the white-haired boys in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this joint for bringing back the girl,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike Shinn said happily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There aren't enough men here to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fend this city properly," Lieutenant Mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row told Clark keenly.

"From what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thargo said, the population of this place</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been steadily dwindling for a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We go to die Temple of the Shaft,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lurain called to Clark. "My father, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lord Kimor, will be there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They rode after her toward the huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black-domed temple that brooded at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the city. It loomed massively in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of them, incomparably the largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most ancient building they had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this land. For it was old, the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">paving in front of it worn deep by ages</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tramping feet, its slot-windows crum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling at the edges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Guards took their horses, and swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">open die high bronze doors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple. Lurain led the way inside, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">slim, boyish figure striding widi her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheathed sword rattling on the stone floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clark and his men, following her inside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused for a moment, thunderstruck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The interior of the temple was one co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lossal room, dim and dusky and vast, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">only illumination shafts of sunlight from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slot-like window-s. And it was throb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing and quivering to a thunder of bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing sound that was deafening, an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken, tremendous roar of waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The racing river from outside ran right</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the temple, through a gap in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. The waters rushed with blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed across die floor of the vast room, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deep, wide canal, towrard a round, black</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening a hundred feet across that</seg><seg type="columnLine">yawned at the center of the floor. Into</seg><seg type="columnLine">this gaping abyss, the river tumbled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reverberating thunder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">478</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark and his men moved nearer die</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit, stood on the very edge of the abyss.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He peered down into an impenetrable</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness that seemed to go down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowels of the earth. He could make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the vertical sides of the pit were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough rock, in which had been carved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps of a narrow, spiraling stair. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of this stair was closed by a barred</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate guarded by Black warriors. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raging cataract of waters, leaping out over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the pit, tumbled down its</seg><seg type="columnLine">center in a tremendous waterfall, drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping into the dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God! this must be the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the cavern far below--to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lake of Life!" exclaimed Clark, stupefi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, I don't hanker to go down</seg><seg type="columnLine">there,'' said Mike Shinn, awed.

Clark Stan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nard and his men went out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets of the crumbling black city for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Apparently they sauntered idly, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in reality were mapping a route to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple, one that they could follow with</seg><seg type="columnLine">less chance of being observed. He noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Dordonan people now shunned them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at them in half-veiled hate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">News of their blasphemy had apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread in the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Night fell, and Clark watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon rise over the ancient city. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">after some hours had passed, he led the</seg><seg type="columnLine">480</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">others into the dark back rooms of dieir</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwelling, intending to slip out that way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as he entered the darkness there, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpsed a moving figure in the black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. Instantly he leaped at the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped him by the throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a spy!" he grated. "If they've</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out what we're planning, we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunk." And he rasped in the language of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dordona to his prisoner, "One shout and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Release me -- I will not shout,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped a voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lurain!" he exclaimed. "What in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">W'orld-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dragged the girl over to one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows, where the moonlight illumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated her white, strange face and distend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you doing, spying on us?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clark demanded, his face hardening as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I came to fulfill the promise I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made you, to lead you down to the holy</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake!" she gasped.

"Stannar, why did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell my father Kimor you wished to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scend to the lake? That was madness!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you had promised me that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would see that I got down the shaft,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clark said bewilderedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You do not understand," Lurain told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "I made that promise, yes--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I meant was that I would secretly</seg><seg type="columnLine">take you down the shaft; for if my father</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew of it he would slay us instantly for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sacrilege--yes, even me, his daughter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought you understood that and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be silent about the lake until I could ful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill my promise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord,4 I've misjudged you, Lurain,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clark told her impulsively. "Come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of it, it was rather asinine of me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurt out my whole business without mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sure how things stood. But I hadn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had time to think, I guess, in the rush of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our escape."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I had to pretend ignorance when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you reproached me," she said. "But I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">come now, Stannar. I shall fulfill my</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise and take you down to the cavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Lake of Life. The sin will be on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head, not on my father and people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And my sin will be expiated, for surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Guardians will slay us down there for</seg><seg type="columnLine">our sacrilege."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was trembling violently, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">her voice was steady.

"There are no Guardians down</seg><seg type="columnLine">there--that is legend only. Even if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were there, I have my weapon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said nothing, but he knew she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced of the futility of all human</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons against those mysterious ward-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers. He turned to his four men, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened tensely in the dark room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll stay here," Clark told them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I should be back by morning with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters from the lake, if all goes well."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why don't we go with you?" Blacky</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when Lurain understood the ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, she shook her head.

The girl, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, carried a short, pointed metal bar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She led by deserted alleys of crumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins, not toward the great temple, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward a ruined, deserted stone building</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quarter-milc from the great dome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CLARK followed her wonderingly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">die ruin. She led across a room</seg><seg type="columnLine">strewn with debris of crumbling stone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knelt on die corner of the stone floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knelt puzzledly beside her, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tiny flashlight beam on the weathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks of the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dig out these blocks," whispered Lu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain, pointing to the floor. "I will hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I don't-" Clark began, then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">halted and obeyed. It was evident diat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lurain knew what she was about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the metal bar she had brought, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon dug out four of the big blocks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was revealed beneath them a dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">burrow-like opening in the earth, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of a horizontal underground pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage. Lurain dropped quickly down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">diis, and Clark followed. Turning his</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam, he discovered the passage was</seg><seg type="columnLine">\V.

They were of the rebels</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that time who finally left Dordona to</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the city K'Laipm. They could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter the pit from the temple, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stair-head there is always guarded, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw. So they dug this passage, opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the pit below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just as they finished their sacrilegious</seg><seg type="columnLine">work," she continued, "their plot was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected.

"Let's get on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led the way, flashing his beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. As they advanced in the passage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they heard a dull roar that became louder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and louder. Clark knew it was the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cataract falling into the sacred</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft, and his excitement increased. Lu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain, pressing on behind him, was shiver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They reached the end of the passage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They crouched, petrified by the stupefy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing view ahead.

The steps were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not four feet wide, grown with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slimy green moss of ages, drenched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripping with spray. Looking up, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could just glimpse the moonlit interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great temple, could just see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads of the armored guards on duty at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head of the stair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking down, he could see nothing--</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but an unplumbed abyss of dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness into which the waters tumbled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">round whose side dropped the coils of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiral stair. Clark's nerves shrank, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">palled for the moment from the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of venturing down into that enigmatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulf, along that slippery, ancient way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then his jaw set in renewed resolution.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Below lay what he had come so far to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lurain, we go downward now," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told the girl, raising his voice over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar.

This setting, restrain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly w'orked up in blue-grays and blue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks, w'as not the first thing to catdi the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye, however. The front of the picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">w-as filled with lively dancing creatures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as pink, plump and naked as cherubs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as patently evil as the meditations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Satan in his rare idle moments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I counted those dancers. There w'ere</seg><seg type="columnLine">tw'elve of them, ranged in a half-circle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were cavorting in evident glee</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a central object--a prone cross,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which appeared to be made of two stout</seg><seg type="columnLine">logs w'ith some of the bark still upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. To this cross a pair of the pink</seg><seg type="columnLine">things--that makes fourteen--kneeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swinging blocky-looking hammers or</seg><seg type="columnLine">mauls, spiked a human figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I say human when I speak of that fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure, and I withhold the w'ord in describ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the dancers and their hammer-wield-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fellows. There is a reason. The su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pine victim on the cross was a beautifully</seg><seg type="columnLine">represented male body, as clear and anat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">omically correct as an illustration in a sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gical textbook. The head w'as w'rithed</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, as if in pain, and I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the face or its expression; but in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortured tenseness of the muscles, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slat)' white sheen of the skin with jagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaks of vivid gore upon it, agonized</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature wras plain and doubly plain. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                   483</seg><seg type="columnLine">484</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could almost see the painted limbs writhe</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the transfixing nails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the same token, the dancers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammerers were so dynamically done as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to seem half in motion before my eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So muclf for the sound skill of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">painter. Yet, where the crucified prisoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all clarity, these others were all fog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No lines, no angles, no muscles--their</seg><seg type="columnLine">features could not be seen or sensed. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not even sure if they had hair or not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was as if each was picked out with a ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light in that surrounding dusk, light</seg><seg type="columnLine">that revealed and yet shimmered indis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctly; light, too, that had absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of comfort or honesty in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">oi.d on, there!" came a sharp chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenge from the stairs behind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">below me. "What are you doing? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what's that picture doing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I started so that I almost lost my foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and fell upon the speaker--one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Museum guards. He was a slight old</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow and his thin hair was gray, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced upon me with all the righteous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry pluck of a beefy policeman. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude surprized and nettled me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was going to ask somebody that</seg><seg type="columnLine">same question," I told him as austerely as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could manage. "What about this pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture? I thought there was a Bocklin hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guard relaxed his forbidding at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titude at first sound of my voice. "Oh, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">beg your pardon, sir. I thought you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody else--the man who brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that thing." He nodded at the picture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the hostile glare came back into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. "It so happened that he talked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me first, then to the curator. Said it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">art--great art--and the Museum must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have it." He lifted his shoulders, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrug or a shudder. "Personally, I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's plain beastly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it was, I grew aware as I looked at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it again. "And the Museum has accepted</seg><seg type="columnLine">it at last?" I prompted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head. "Oh, no, sir. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour ago he was at the back door, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nasty daub there under his arm. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard part of the argument. He got in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulting, and he was told to clear out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take his picture with him. But he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have got in here somehow, and hung it</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself." Walking close to the painting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as gingerly as though he expected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink dancers to leap out at him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to the lower edge of the frame.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If it was a real Museum piece, we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a plate right there, with the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the painter and the title."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I, too, came close. There was no plate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the guard had said. But in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower left-hand corner of the canvas were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawling capitals, pale paint on the dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spelling out the word GOLGOTHA. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath these, in small, barely readable</seg><seg type="columnLine">script:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sold my soul that I might paint a</seg><seg type="columnLine">living picture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No signature or other clue to the ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist's identity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guard had discovered a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">framed rectangle against the wall to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. "Here's the picture he took down,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he informed me, highly relieved. "Help</seg><seg type="columnLine">me put it back, will you, sir? And do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you suppose," here he grew almost wist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, "that we could get rid of this other</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing before someone finds I let the crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool slip past me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took one edge of The Isle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dead and lifted it to help him hang it</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell you what," I offered on sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse; "I'll take this Golgotha piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">home with me, if you like."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Would you do that?" he almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled out in his joy at the suggestion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Would you, to oblige me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To oblige myself," I returned. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">need another picture at my place."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLGOTHA DANCERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">485</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the upshot of it was, he smug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled me and the unwanted painting out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Museum. Never mind how. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done quite enough as it is to jeop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ardize his job and my own welcome up</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was not until I had paid off my taxi</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lugged the unwieldy parallelo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gram of canvas and wood upstairs to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bachelor apartment that I bothered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder if it might be valuable. I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">did find out, but from the first I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply impressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hung over my own fireplace, it looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as large and living as a scene glimpsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a window or, perhaps, on a stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a theater. The capering pink bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught new lights from my lamp, lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">that glossed and intensified their shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">and color but did not reveal any new de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails. I pored once more over the cryptic</seg><seg type="columnLine">legend: I sold my soul that I might paint</seg><seg type="columnLine">a living picture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A living picture--was it that? I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not answer. For all my honest delight in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such things, I cannot be called expert or</seg><seg type="columnLine">even knowing as regards art. Did I even</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the Golgotha painting? I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sure of that, either. And the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inscription, about selling a soul; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was considerably intrigued by that, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">let my thoughts ramble on the subject of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Satanist complexes and the vagaries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-crazy painters. As I read, that eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, I glanced up again and again at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">new possession. Sometimes it seemed ri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diculous, sometimes sinister. Shortly after</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight I rose, gazed once more, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then turned out the parlor lamp. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, or so it seemed, I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">those dancers, so many dim-pink silhou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ettes in the sudden darkness. I went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kitchen for a bit of whisky and water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thence to my bedroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had dreams. In them I was a boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and my mother and sister were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the house to go to a theater where</seg><seg type="columnLine">--think of it!--Richard Mansfield would</seg><seg type="columnLine">play Bean Brummell. I, the youngest, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">told to stay at home and mind the troub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesome furnace. I wept copiously in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointed loneliness, and then Mans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field himself stalked in, in full Brum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mell regalia. He laughed goldenly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched out his hand in warm greeting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I, the lad of my dreams, put out my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, then was frightened when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not loosen his grasp. I tugged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he laughed again. The gold of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter turned suddenly hard, cold. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tugged with all my strength, and woke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something held me tight by the wrist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In my first half-moment of wakeful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness I was aware that die room was filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">widi the pink dancers of the picture, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">nimble, fierce-happy motion. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">man-size, too, or nearly so, visible in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark with the dim radiance of fox-fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On die small scale of the painting they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seemed no more than babyishly</seg><seg type="columnLine">plump; now they were gross, like huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect toads. And, as I awakened fully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were closing in, a menacing ring of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, around my bed. One stood at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">right side, and its grip, clumsy and rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bery-hard like that of a monkey, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed upon my arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw and sensed all this, as I say, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single moment. With the sensing came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the realization of peril, so great that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not stop to wonder at the uncanniness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my visitors. I tried frantically to jerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose. For the moment I did not succeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as I thrashed about, throwing my</seg><seg type="columnLine">body nearly across the bed, a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancer dashed in from the left. It seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clamped my other arm. I felt, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">dian heard, a wave of soft, wordless mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riment from them all. My heart and sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ews seemed to fail, and briefly I lay still</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a daze of horror, pinned down cruci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fix-fashion between my two captors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">486</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was that a hammer raised above me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sprawled?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There rushed and swelled into me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden startled strength that sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">favors the desperate. I screamed like any</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild tiling caught in a trap, rolled some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how out of bed and to my feet. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beings I shook off and the other I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed against the bureau. Freed, I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the bedroom door and the front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the apartment, stumbling and staggering</seg><seg type="columnLine">on fear-weakened legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the dim-shining pink things</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred my way at the very threshold, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others were closing in behind, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a sudden rush. I flung my right fist</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all my strength and weight. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">being bobbed back unresistingly before</seg><seg type="columnLine">my smash, like a rubber toy floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">through water. I plunged past, reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entry and fumbled for the knob of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were all about me then, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber)' palms fumbling at my shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my elbow's, my pajama jacket. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have dragged me down before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could negotiate the lock. A racking shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der possessed me and seemed to flick</seg><seg type="columnLine">them clear. Then I stumbled against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, and purely by good luck my hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell upon a bamboo walking-stick. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled again, in truly hysterical fierceness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laid about me as with a whip. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows did little or no damage to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">unearthly assailants, but they shrank back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">teetering and dancing, to a safe distance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again I had the sense that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing, mocking. For the moment I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had beaten them off, but they were sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me in the end. Just then my groping</seg><seg type="columnLine">free hand pressed a switch. The entry</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang into light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the instant they were not there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Somebody was knocking outside, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with trembling fingers I turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knob of the door. In came a tall, slender</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">girl with a blue lounging-robe caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly around her. Her bright hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">was disordered as though she had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprung from her bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is someone sick?" she asked in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathless voice. "I live down the hall--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard cries." Her round blue eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">studying my face, which must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly pale. "You see, I'm a trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurse, and perhaps-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God you did come!" I broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, unceremoniously but honestly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went before her to turn on ever)' lamp in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parlor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was she who, without guidance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched out my whisky and siphon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed for me a highball of grateful</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. My teeth rang nervously on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the glass as I gulped it down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After that I got my own robe--a becom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one, with satin facings--and sat with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her on the divan to tell of my adventure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I had finished, she gazed long at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the painting of the dancers, then back at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Her eyes, like two chips of the April</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, were full of concern and she held</seg><seg type="columnLine">her rosy low'er lip between her teeth. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that she was wonderfully pretty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What a perfectly terrible nightmare!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was no nightmare," I protested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled and argued the point, tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me all manner of comforting things</seg><seg type="columnLine">about mental associations and their re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flections in vivid dreams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To clinch her point she turned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">painting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This line about a 'living picture' is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peg on which your slumbering mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung the whole fabric," she suggested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her slender fingertip toudiing the painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribble. "Your very literal subconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">self didn't understand that the artist</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant his picture would live only figura-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you sure that's what the artist</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant?" I asked, but finally I let her con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLGOTHA DANCERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">487,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vince me. One can imagine how badly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to be convinced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She mixed me another highball, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short one for herself. Over it she told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">her name Miss Dolby--and finally she</seg><seg type="columnLine">left me with a last comforting assurance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, nightmare or no, I did not sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">again that night. I sat in the parlor</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the lamps, smoking and dipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">into book after book. Countless times I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt my gaze drawn back to the painting</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the fireplace, with the cross and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nail-pierced wretch and the shimmering</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink dancers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the rising sun had filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment with its honest light and cheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt considerably calmer. I slept all</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, and in the afternoon was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to agree with Miss Dolby that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole business had been a bad dream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing more. Dressing, I went down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hall, knocked on her door and invited</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to dinner with me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a good dinner. Afterward we</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to an amusing motion picture, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles Butterworth in it as I remember.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After bidding her good-night, I went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own place. Undressed and in bed, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay awake. My late morning slumber</seg><seg type="columnLine">made my eyes slow to close. Thus it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that T heard the faint shuffle of feet and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting up against my pillows, saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing silhouettes of the Golgotha</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancers. Alive and magnified, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeping into my bedroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not hesitate or shrink this time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sprang up, tense and defiant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, you don't!" I yelled at them. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">they seemed to hesitate before the impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my wild voice, I charged frantically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment I scattered them and got</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the bedroom door, as on the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious night. There was another shindy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the entry; this time they all got hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me, like a pack of hounds, and wres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled me back against the wall. I writhe</seg><seg type="columnLine">even now when I think of the unearthly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hardness of their little gripping paws.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two on each arm were spread-eagling me</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the plaster. The cruciform position</seg><seg type="columnLine">again!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I swore, yelled and kicked. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was in the way of my foot. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated back, unhurt. That was their</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and horror--their ability to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">flabby and non-resistant under smashing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flattening blows. Something tickled my</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm, pricked it. The point of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spike. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Dolby!" I shrieked, as a child</seg><seg type="columnLine">might call for its mother. "Help! Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">D-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door flew open; I must not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked it. "Here I am," came her un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was outlined against the rectangle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light from the hall. My assailants let</seg><seg type="columnLine">go of me to dance toward her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped but did not scream.

But her eyes did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">linger on the woman, nor the tray. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead, they focussed on die still form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. DeBrugh in the sofa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was slumped down, his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted to one side and his mouth hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing open from the shaking Mrs. De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brugh had given him.

She became even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbearable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were little things, like taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">away her privilege of having Saturday</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoons off. And the occasional "for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting" of Letty's weekly pay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once Letty thought of leaving during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night, of packing her few clothes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">going for ever from the house. But that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was foolish.

Perhaps she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not live much longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then one morning Mrs. DeBrugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Letty in to talk with her. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hour Letty had been awaiting--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreading.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a harsh, gloating tone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. DeBrugh's voice as she spoke.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't so! Mrs. DeBrugh was lying!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the will she was afraid of. Letty</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered Mr. DeBrugh's promise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did not complain, however. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">only words were, 'Til leave tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night she packed her things. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no definite plans, but she hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">something would turn up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleep would not come easy, so Letty</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay in bed and thought of old Mr. De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brugh.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened closely, but the whisper was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, noiselessly, she got out of bed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped into slippers, and drew a robe</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her.

Mrs. DeBrugh lay in the bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as in sleep, but Lett)' knew, as she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known about Mr. DeBrugh, that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She quickly called the doctor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometime much later he arrived, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy from lack of sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dead," he remarked, after looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the body.

M. Wilson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">printed below, makes an astonishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">accusation against Weird Tales; as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonishing because this magazine has often</seg><seg type="columnLine">been blamed for a policy the exact opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that attributed to us by Mr. Wilson. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">says, in effect, that our stories lack interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">because the reader knows in advance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will all end happily, the villain will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">defeated and virtue will triumph no matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">what odds are against such an ending. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">recall that Weird Tales was once rebuked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one of the magazines for writers because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our publication of The Seeds of Death by</seg><seg type="columnLine">David H. Keller (July, 1931). The story</seg><seg type="columnLine">was called "immoral" because the hero was</seg><seg type="columnLine">given over to a lingering death, and the vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lainess succeeded in her evil schemes. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our interplanetary stories was criticized by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of our readers because the red-headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">reporter, who had endeared himself to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">readers, was killed on Mars and could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to Earth with die rest of the space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling party. A glance at the August</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue (which is on the stands as this is writ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten) shows at least four stories that refute</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Wilson's accusation against us. In one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these (The Will of the Dead by Loretta</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burrough) a scheming mother, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominated her son's life, wrought a hideous</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom upon her innocent daughter-in-law;</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of which makes a fascinating story but</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not allow virtue to triumph. In another</seg><seg type="columnLine">(The Last Pharaoh by Thomas P. Kelley),</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lovable English girl and her brother had</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies taken from them so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pharaoh and his paramour could acquire their</seg><seg type="columnLine">healthy bodies on which to transplant their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own heads--surely a defeat of all that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">good; the evil deed is not undone either,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though destruction overtakes the guilty</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair at the last. Most of our stories do end</seg><seg type="columnLine">happily because chac is the way the authors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">write them; but our readers can never know</seg><seg type="columnLine">in advance whether the ending will be hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">py or otherwise. Mr. Wilson's letter follows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Does Virtue Always Win?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> G.	M. Wilson, whose letter we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered above, writes from Rosebank, New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York: "I realize that this epistle is slated</seg><seg type="columnLine">for immediate deposit in the nethermost</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths of the wastebasket, but nevertheless</seg><seg type="columnLine">I still am having the satisfaction of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">something off my chest that has been both-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering me for some time. The point I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing up is, I suppose, one of the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentionables of die 'pulps'. It is, to put it</seg><seg type="columnLine">tersely: why must virtue always triumph? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">read some years ago that a writer who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to achieve success with your type of</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine must never let heroism be over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come by villainy. I see that your audiors</seg><seg type="columnLine">have taken this lesson to heart, or perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is your editorial policy to accept only</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories which follow this category. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no doubt that your publication could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be one of the best 'escape mechanisms' in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the literary field; however, it becomes mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">notonous to an extreme after the first two</seg><seg type="columnLine">issues. The remedy is simple: you need only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to vary your menu slightly. Your authors</seg><seg type="columnLine">display enough ingenuity and skill; your</seg><seg type="columnLine">field, that of the uncanny, is interesting; in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, you lack only the quality of variety to</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevate your magazine far above the pulp</seg><seg type="columnLine">class. Why not let the reader have some</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonable doubt as to whether the 'fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired boy' will conquer the nasty villain or</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrosity. As it is now, no one is ever in</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt as to the outcome. Our upright young</seg><seg type="columnLine">American will win, no matter what the odds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is similar to the old-time movie serials</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the hero falls down a thousand-foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff at the end of part nine and comes up</seg><seg type="columnLine">as strong as ever in part ten. It is true that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                    503</seg><seg type="columnLine">504</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIRD TALES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you publish stories of the extraordinary, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">God, it is too extraordinary to stomach hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing right win continually.

The point</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that you have the makings of an excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine, above the class of the usual pulp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet you usually and deliberately tie yourself</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with this one flaw. I suppose you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">a success financially and have a large reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">public, but don't you think you could widen</seg><seg type="columnLine">your appeal and increase your circulation by</seg><seg type="columnLine">adopting the above suggestion? No doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am wrong, for it is your business to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">the psychology of your reading public; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet I'm not so sure I'm wrong. I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's something in all of us that delights</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the exaltation of evil. I am no publicity</seg><seg type="columnLine">hound, but I think if you were to publish</seg><seg type="columnLine">this letter and ask for comments you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">find that many of your readers wrould agree</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me. In any event, if you could answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">me personally and state your reasons for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exclusion of all stories in which the hero</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't triumph, I should be grateful.

You have no kiisks coming. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I have several suggestions diat would tend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make the magazine perfect. The first:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why such a stria policy in your reprint de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment? As matters stand, Weird Tales</seg><seg type="columnLine">readers are given only the shorter stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">from your back issues. Weren't there some</seg><seg type="columnLine">praiseworthy longer ones? Of course there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is die old cry against long reprints--Authors</seg><seg type="columnLine">must eat!--but you could easily circumvcnt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. When you plan to reprint a novelette,</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely skip a reprint for one montii and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make up for it the second month. Or use</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller type. After all, the type in the Eyrie</seg><seg type="columnLine">has not harmed my eyes. The second idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerns those two great writers who died</seg><seg type="columnLine">recendy--Lovecraft and Howard. For a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time they carried the burden of writing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weird Tales largely between them, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great majority of your readers has probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seen either of them. How about pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures? A photograph of each carried inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">your cover. Make good likenesses of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">(they deserve it) and have no writing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the picture! If necessary, charge extra for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that particular issue. Or skip the other il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lustrations. Or even skip the stories. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">give us those photographs. I will close with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an appreciation of Henry Kuttner.
