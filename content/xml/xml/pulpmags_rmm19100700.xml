Then she spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">consolingly to Wally, turned on her heel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked toward the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten minutes later, Mr. Boglip's bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">temper was somewhaf evaporated. He en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the unlighted parlor, found his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife meditatively contemplating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon through a cluster of tree-tops, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">children having gone to bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A week elapsed since the events just</seg><seg type="columnLine">recorded.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning to New Rochelle one evening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Boglip was greeted by his wife with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tales of ill-doing on the part of the kid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dies, to which was added the statement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made with earnest emphasis, that if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to do his duty toward them by</seg><seg type="columnLine">administering the corporal punishment to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they were clearly entitled, the wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself would set the birch a swinging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By an unlucky coincidence, and. as be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, Mr. Boglip, on this particular day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had undergone a great many things</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had led to his discomfort. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">snappy and cross. He replied that Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boglip didn't know what she was talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, and that he proposed to treat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">train his children as he pleased; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was more, he would do as he liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he liked and where he liked around</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own home! With this and a final</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare at Mrs. Boglip, he stamped up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs to where the small culprits were</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Boglip waited for a moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then slipped quietly out of the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She returned in about ten minutes, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">something akin to a grim smile on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.. Above, she could still hear her lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle hubby lecturing his recalcitrant flock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his remarks being occasionally punctu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated by a shrill protest or explanation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally the talk ceased, the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened and the youngsters descended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little later, Mrs. Boglip heard her</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband come down into the hall, rattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly among the sticks in the umbrella-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, retreat into the kitchen, return and</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the door which led into the garden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then she went to the kitchen and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the key to the kennel gone. Again she</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled as grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Boglip, as he made his way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs through the fast falling dusk was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuming furiously.

Before he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">open it, the dog hurled itself at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a small cyclone. Mr. Boglip, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit of as neat footwork as was ever seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside of a sixteen-foot ring, avoided</seg><seg type="columnLine">the onset and put one of the kennels be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween him and his assailant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But like a flash, the dos; turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursued the fleeing legs of the little man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Boglip spun around to the other side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the kennel just in time to preserve</seg><seg type="columnLine">the integrity of his calves. Then he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reverse the motion as the dog made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twice or thrice was this repeated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the creature halted, growled angrily</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to jump across the kennel-roof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Boglip, scared and perspiring, felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">grateful that the quarters of Wally were</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall and had a sloping roof which pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented the paws-of the bulldog from get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting a hold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An inspiration seized on 'Mr. Boglip</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he yelled to the dogs in the kennels</seg><seg type="columnLine">for help.

Mr. Boglip, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dashes of the bulldog permitted, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken cognizance of these facts, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the conclusion that if he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">once gain the kennel-roof he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">BOGLIP'S CANINE PARTY.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">255</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">no difficulty in jumping to the railing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside of the enclosure he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe. Even as he cast about for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">means and moment for his attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain his freedom, he 'thought with gloat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the revenge that he would have on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creature who had caused him so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror 'and loss of perspiration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To stand on the other side of the wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence armed with a sufficient whip and--</seg><seg type="columnLine">'twould be an act of justice at which even</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife could not take exception.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this instant the bulldog, tired of</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely growling, made a vicious rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Mr. Boglip. The little man, using</seg><seg type="columnLine">both hands and feet, vaulted upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, to his delight and amazement, found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself on the kennel-roof. Poising him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, he hopped over the intervening</seg><seg type="columnLine">space between himself and the railing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and. the next instant, found himself on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lawn. The feat was 'the occasion</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a volley of growls from the bulldog</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a chorus of barks from the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Boglip halted not. but made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house, determined that he would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">his revenge while it was hot and handy</seg><seg type="columnLine">In his late encounter he had dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stick which he had taken with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the kennels, but he had, in reserve, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big dog-whip--a cruel, business-like af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair--that could be felt through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickest hide. And when he had this in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand he--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sort of triumphant " yap " caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to pause and look back.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen-door was of the swinging order</seg><seg type="columnLine">and opened inward.

It is understood that when Fred has graduated, Warring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton will place him. He now finds that he is unable to do so. Bonds of the value of half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">million dollars have been stolen, and suspicion points toward Warrington's son. Warrington,</seg><seg type="columnLine">senior, is suspicious of the motives of Montresor, who has gained the friendship of Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warrington, and apparently of Louise, Warrington's daughter. The old man gives the</seg><seg type="columnLine">task of solving the disappearance of the bonds to Erskine. He is to work absolutely in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, receiving no recognition from Warrington, using any means he wishes. He is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take Louise to the opera that night, but Louise, suspecting him, has the coachman drive to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln Park, and there Fred is assaulted by a man whom he believes to be Montresor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erskine is walking on the lake shore, when he meets Barney McGrane, the discharged coach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of the Warringtons, who is very loyal to Miss Warrington. Erskine succeeds in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vincing him that he is Miss Warrington's friend, and the coachman agrees to work with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Others arrive, and Erskine gathers that it is their intention to kill Warrington. He meets</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young fellow, who agrees to confide in him, but as Erskine leads the way from the shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Warrington is mortally stabbed. During his last moments he discloses to Erskine that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bonds are being expressed by Montresor to Tacoma, in a typewriter machine-box.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erskine and Barney decide to leave the city and follow up the box containing the bonds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They arrive at Wapita Falls. Barney sees Louise and her mother alighting from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train, and imparts this intelligence to Erskine, who, meanwhile, has discovered the box</seg><seg type="columnLine">labeled for Tacoma. Securing tickets for the train on which this box has been shipped, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">finds the two women on board, and visits them in their stateroom, where he tells them of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe's death. The two women leave the train near the Washington State line and Erskine fears</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they have stopped to telegraph to Warrington, accusing himself and Barney of bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about the young man's death. Determined to recover the bonds at all costs, he decides</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold up the train behind which he knows carries Montresor and the express box which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is after. He and Barney slip from their Pullman as the train nears Two Rivers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">securing a hand-car, set out for the tunnel-mouth they have selected for the hold-up. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">â¢the way the hand-car runs away and upsets while they are trying to prevent its crashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a freight-train ahead, but both escape with a few bruises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     CHAPTER XVI.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     A Fateful Encounter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HEN McGrane arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the spot at which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Altoona man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting him, Erskine</seg><seg type="columnLine">bade him put down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit - case he carried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then slipped a revolver and cartridge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt into his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Speaking deliberately, Erskine said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Began in the March Railroad Man's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">331</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" As I have told you, this revolver con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains nothing but blank cartridges.

From his match-</seg><seg type="columnLine">box he extracted several matches, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaning forward, peered back along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, faintly at first, but growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter each moment, lie saw the glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the headlight of the approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">train!

With a wild,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exultant thrill he suddenly realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not yet too late to draw back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desperate act he had meditated. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seemed to see again the wan, despair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing face of Andrew Warrington, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered all that Andrew Warrington</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his ears eclioed the words of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general manager's dying son: " My hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">or, and my father's." And he wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">how--if he failed in his quest--Andrew *</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warrington would explain to Louise his</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons for causing her to become ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quainted with "Frederick Erskine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several minutes the headlight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the onrushing locomotive had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared from his view, but the rumble of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approaching train was growing loud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er in his ears. Then, like the crack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mighty whip, goading him on to action,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the detonation of the first of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpedoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He struck a match, and held it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the little tin cylinder between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rails. Before the match went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little ruby glow began to spread be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brighter and brighter grew the red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dish light.

From</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him came the whistling of air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brakes, and a dull, grinding sound that</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured him that the train was slowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. The glow of the flare he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted was so bright that he dared not</seg><seg type="columnLine">look over his shoulder lest the engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the locomotive should see his masked</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, and prepare to offer effectual resist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance or decide to put on speed again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At length he became aware of the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a dark figure, a score of paces far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther on, was crouching beside the track,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he knew it was McGrane. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red light vanished suddenly, a whistle</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded sharply,' and a broad stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow light shot ahead of him along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">track.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The locomotive of the Cascade flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">was close behind him. Turning abrupt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, the Altoona man leaped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">track, and a moment later the great, hiss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing locomotive slowed down beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Erskine looked for McGrane. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irishman already was in action, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only four or five paces away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">â¢	" All right, sir! " McGrane called re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuringly ; then, reaching up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand-rail of the locomotive, he swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself up to the cab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For only a moment did Erskine hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tate; then, as he heard the Irishman</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout " Hands up! " to the occupants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cab, he dashed down to the express-</seg><seg type="columnLine">car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The incidents that followed happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, and ever afterward they seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Erskine like those of a nightmare.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How he entered the express-car he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know. He remembered seeing around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him two or three blanched faces as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at them over his revolver. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had asked the occupants of the car if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had a typewriter aboard. This he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had assured them was all that he wanted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as he spoke he knew by the expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions on the faces of the men he addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they believed him to be mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Satisfied that he was a dangerous luna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic, however, they quickly decided to hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mor him. One of them pointed to a box</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one of the corners of the car. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box were the words, " Anxell Typewri-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ter," and the address he had read in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage-room at Wapiti Falls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He directed the men to take it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side door of the car, and they obeyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. With a thrust of his foot he sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out into the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " When I go close the door, and do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not open it again until you are out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunshot," he commanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he finished speaking he left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car, and the door was closed behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moving quickly, Erskine grasped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope handles of the box and hurried with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to the front of the train. There he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw it on the platform at the doorless</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the baggage-car. This done, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed up his suit-case, and McGrane's</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside it, after which he hurried to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">locomotive and mounted to the cab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as he was about to enter the cab</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dark figure moved toward him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erskine suddenly realized that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking into the muzzle of a revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " McGrane ! " exclaimed the Altoona</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in a warning voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an oath, the dark figure leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him. From the muzzle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver leaped a flash of flame that al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most blinded him, and the report of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver pistol's discharge rang in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears. As he grappled with the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fired at him, Erskine saw that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slighter than McGrane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">â¢	Erskine's left hand had closed around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right wrist of- his adversary, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand gripped the stranger's throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It required only a second or two to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vince Erskine that he was the stronger</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two, and, satisfied of this, he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laxed his hold on the throat of his as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a quick movement of his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, he grasped the still smoking re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver, then swung it against the other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was loaded with ball cartridges, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominated by a spirit of desperation, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was resolved to shoot any one who now</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacked him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">334</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Already his game seemed half lost, for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmasked as he was, he was in imminent</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger of being seen by some one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be able to describe his features</seg><seg type="columnLine">to those who, within a few hours, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">essay the task of running him down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the light of the lantern that hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the gages, Erskine now saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finish of a struggle that had been waged</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the fireman's side of the cab.

Threatened with prosecu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion on the charge of having been con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nected with the death of Joseph War-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rington, and branded as a criminal by his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">father who seemed resolved to sacrifice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his only son to a stern, but misguided,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sense of duty.

The world seemed to have con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted until it was no larger than a pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on-yard, and he felt that no matter where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might turn, he would be unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape the vigilance of scores of unseen</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes that were watching his every move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The unfortunate man knew, too. that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if his father proved to be so unrelenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to carry him on to Weatherbee, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope of escape would lie vain. Even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">his father kept silent on the subject of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hold-up, the men in the express-car</seg><seg type="columnLine">would speak : and Tatlock. the fireman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would- give a careful description of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men he had seen unmasked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this Fred had realized when, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching his father, he had threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to commit suicide if he should be car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried beyond Tyrcone, where the West</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coast Express, which he had left at Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rivers, now was awaiting the passage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cascade Limited. Within his grasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">he held the bonds which represented the</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor of the Warrington family, and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the restoration of those bonds to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper place was to be prevented by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own father's unrelenting sense of duty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now the young man began to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach himself for his failure to take his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father into his confidence. He was satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied that if Andrew Warrington had fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen the situation that confronted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent, he would have been willing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Samuel Erskine should be given as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">information as might be necessary to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able him to act with more intelligence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was too late now to effect this</seg><seg type="columnLine">compromise with the letter of his instruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. While he had found it possible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">descend from the back of the big tender</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the platform of the baggage-car, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was manifestly unable to return by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was resolved that if he passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tyrcone, he would carry out the threat</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had made to his father. Gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">it dawned on Erskine's mind that the lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comotive was slackening speed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man stiffened suddenly, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped back into his trousers-pocket the</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver he had half-drawn out. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit of hopelessness that had dominated</seg><seg type="columnLine">him only a moment before now gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to mingled exultation and self-re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam Erskine, the father, had tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umphed over Sam Erskine, the duty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound engineer, and the son had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">given the benefit of the doubt.

Knowing that this train was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not scheduled to stop at Tyrcone, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only one inference to be drawn from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that it had stopped there to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. The hold-up of the train was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be reported to the proper authorities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a result of the brief stop at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene of the hold-up, due to Erskine's</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompt action in getting the train into</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion, no opportunity had been afford-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the men in the express-car to get into</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication with the conductor or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine-crew.

And so to the unfortunate young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man it seemed clear that a sense of duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">had triumphed over his father's affec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, after all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only for a moment did Frederick Er-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skine hesitate, however ; then, turning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">McGrane, he urged him to greater haste.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Cascade flier had stopped between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waiting West Coast Express and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">station platform, and it was the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the two trains that Erskine now</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heading toward. The car from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he and his companion had leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Two Rivers was the second from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear of the train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scarcely more than a minute sufficed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enable the two men to get between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trains.

When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and his companion had left the train</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Two Rivers, it had been impossible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, for him to close behind him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door through which they had leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the vestibuled platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was scarcely probable that this open</seg><seg type="columnLine">door had escaped the notice of'Some mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the train-crew before Tyrcone was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached; but it was most likely that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">person who had found it open had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascribed the fact to some act of careless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness on the part of one of the trainmen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The return of two men with suit-cases,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken in connection with the report of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hold-up of the Cascade flier, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">even now must be spreading in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the station, most naturally would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be regarded with suspicion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having retreated beyond the porter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">view, Erskine was trying to formulate</seg><seg type="columnLine">some excuse for his presence with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit-case in that part of the car when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly realized that he was standing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the door of the stateroom in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had interviewed Miss Warring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton. Miss Warington had left the train</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Bernardville, and had not returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was most probable, therefore, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stateroom which had been vacated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and her mother was still unoccupied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trying the door, he found that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlocked.

It was essential, however, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he get to his section with the suit-cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the least possible, delay, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be done in a manner that would en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able him to elude observation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Brace up.

These things</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did without appearing to think about</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and this day he whistled and sang</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if there were no hard riddles in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world for men to solve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he started across the river to</seg><seg type="columnLine">troll for pike, she followed him with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes so long as she could, and was glad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him again whenever he passed in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of vision on his way up and down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On his return with several fish, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy; and it seemed strange to her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel so pleased at a man's home-coming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To her that sort of thing had so often</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant the disgruntled return of the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful hunter, or the arrival of a fam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished one with skins to prepare, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing and moccasins to mend, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom food had to-be made ready, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">first partook of it, and of the best thereof,</seg><seg type="columnLine">often leaving scant pickings for the wom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en and xhildren.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was good to see them when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought plenty of food and pelts, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was evil when they were empty-handed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there was no deep pleasure in it, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectation, nothing that could be trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated into a desire for a mere presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now that she felt that sensation, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not understand it, and accepted it as</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the phases of an existence in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unexpected ever occurs. She had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">women that had borne children," and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted how, nearly at once, the instinct had</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened by which the mother and child</seg><seg type="columnLine">became inseparable things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All these things were not clearly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fined in her mind. There had merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened in her a sense of possession such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the child feels for its doll, for even In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dian girl baliies have dolls, and play with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them; and in them, as in others, the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinct of motherliness develops even be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the capacity for love. This girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that one should be grateful for</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindness, and her sentiment appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her as a manifestation of gratitude. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had so much to be thankful for that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not surprise her that this feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">should take a new 'form.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Pierre returned, she was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad, though she scarcely showed it. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">all Indians, she was afraid of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">A HEART OF THE NORTH.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">367</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at, and possessed a sentiment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignity that could only melt away after</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer acquaintance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her face was, therefore, nearly always</seg><seg type="columnLine">impassive when he spoke to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had several fish, and showed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">one that weighed probably ten pounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It isn't so bad." he said. ,l But I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointed. Either there are not many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them or they are not biting well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Plenty pike," she answered, " but on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first of cold weather fish often bite</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went off again to investigate his</seg><seg type="columnLine">set lines, but found only a small dorc and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big chub, which he kept for bait. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaning his fish, he went back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent, intending to cut some more fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood. The ax was very dull, and he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to sharpen it with a small file.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was seated near the girl, in the wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly opened tent, and suddenly she grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm, and he saw that she was pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the opposite shore, perhaps half a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. Looking keenly, he finally caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of a large grayish animal, showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">very indistinctly in the bushes among</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it stood. The two watched it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time, until it moved back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods and ^disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Caribou, wasn't it? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yes. ateck," answered the girl. " Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">doe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pierre took the gun out of its cover, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt in his pockets to see if he had a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridges to spare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I'm going to look." he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She watched him go off pnce more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He left the dog with her. for Paddy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of doubtful utility as a hunter of big</seg><seg type="columnLine">game. The canoe went straight to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other shore, then gently up stream. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl saw Pierre land near the place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had seen the animal. He pulled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe up. and bent down, looking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks, and then waved his hand at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disappeared in the woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then within an hour and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sundown, and she settled down to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently. The time seemed long, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun kept on going lower and lower, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she began to wonder that he did not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, faintly, a long way off to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">east, apparently among the distant hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the river, she heard the booming</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a shot, and then of a second one. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were very faint, for the smokeless powder</seg><seg type="columnLine">made but little noise. In fact, an ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">less well trained than hers would scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">have noticed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came upon her a feeling of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety, for he must be very far away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sun had set. He was only a mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieur, and he might get lost in the woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming home. It would be dark before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a constant subject of laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the guides, both Indians and hab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itants, this amazing ignorance of the peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple they took with them to fish and hunt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some could not see a plain bear-track</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them, and others could not fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low a blazed trail without getting lost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while there were hardly any who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">light a fire in the woods if there was the"</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest bit of rain or wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were strange people, with much</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, most of whom could not speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">French, and who went into raptures over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ouananiche such as the boys at Pointe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bleue sometimes caught with a hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line in the early spring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this man was not so stupid as all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that--he knew something of the woods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps, if he were lost, he would climb a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree to make out his bearings. She ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a big fire, so that he might see</seg><seg type="columnLine">it from a high tree or from the top of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Painfully she dragged herself out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tent. She had not realized how weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was. Every effort cost her pain, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every breath she took stabbed her wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, yet she gritted her teeth and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her hands and knees to the place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the embers were still smoldering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a good deal of wood ready-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut. and she gathered the burning ends</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fanned them with a piece of birch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark. Little by little she added other</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits and splinters and got a flame, upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she placed the cut logs until she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a great bright, fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she realized that all she had would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not last more than half an hour at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate, and took the ax. which Pierre had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left behind, and dragged herself to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had felled some dead trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here she had to rest for a long time</seg><seg type="columnLine">before getting up on her feet. She gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few good blows, and the chips flew in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">workmanlike manner, but presently she</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt faint, the ax dropped out of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">368</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, a dimness came over her eyes,, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world went around and around and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell unconscious upon' the mossy soil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paddy came to her and sniffed at her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">put his paw upon her, and whined a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">times. Then he sat by her and waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently, but as she did not move he</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated these maneuvers, and, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved unsuccessful, uttered a long, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal howl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meanwhile, Pierre had followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tracks of a cow caribou. The animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">was evidently making its way quietly to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the east. In wet and mossy places</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was the quadruple mark of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoof that he knew so well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was already getting late and he won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered whether he would be able to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">her before sundown; it was worth trying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As venison, it was really better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">moose, and the back fat was desirable, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his supply of pork and butter for frying</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pretty low. At any rate, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow on a little farther, cautiously, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would then go back to camp and return</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following morning and make a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In many of the wet places he noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the water had not yet filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks. She was probably quite near. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning she might have traveled very</seg><seg type="columnLine">far. In some mossy places she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped for a moment to crop the lichens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Suddenly, from a distance, to his right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard the call of a stag, and so near</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him as to startle him came the hind's</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer. There was a little clump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">alders close to a brook, about sixty yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and from this emerged the cow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffing in the direction of the stag's call.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something frightened her, or she deci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ded to make a dash toward the stag, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">she started with a great leap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this moment the rifle rang out--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she fell. But she was up again in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant, and Pierre shot once more as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she disappeared among the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pierre then realized that the night was</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling, and that he had hardly been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to see his sights. Still, it was cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain that the first shot had hit her hard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably somewhere about the right fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. The second was very doubtful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was getting dark so fast that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hardly follow her track, but just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as he began to despair of finding her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw his quarry lying upon one side--</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hastily he bled it and gralloched it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and removed a hind leg to take baqk with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. But all this took some time, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever much he hurried. He took birch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark and split some sticks in which he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted pieces of the bark, and planted</seg><seg type="columnLine">them around the carcass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He also placed a handkerchief over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the animal and fastened it with a stone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to scare away the wild prowlers, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to consider the problem before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The weather was good enough and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have lighted a fire and remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">there until morning, but he was rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious about the girl. The idea sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly arose in his mind that while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left her the Carcajou, breaking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">oath, might have come down and cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The notion of such a possibility made</seg><seg type="columnLine">inaction intolerable. He had taken the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun; she was left with no defense. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if this had not happened, sick peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple were never so well in the evening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She needed food, a fire, tea, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">medicine.	v</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, she would not worry about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. She was an Indian and accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to waiting; but, after all, it would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be right to leave her there all night, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no care.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great river was directly west of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and he could certainly fetch it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his compass, though it would be a tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">job through the tangled woods and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The caribou had led him through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard country, yet she had unerringly</seg><seg type="columnLine">found good going, but now it was out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question to follow the back track in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started hurriedly, but in a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time could no longer see his compass. Af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter a while, he lit a match and looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. He had only about a dozen with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would not last very long if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at his compass often, and he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep a few to light a fire with, in case</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not get out of the woods that*</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked on more slowly, bending</seg><seg type="columnLine">every effort to keep his direction. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not see the north star, for the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">A HEART OF THE NORTH.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">369</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was cloudy, and after an interval he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to light another match.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before doing this, however, he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a torch of birch-bark and lighted it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned some time, during which he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped often to consult the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass,' but he soon got up to his knees in</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamps and had to push through im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrable thickets of alders and vines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I-Iis torch went out, but he had seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just before, the tops of a high clump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees in the direction he wanted to fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. They were limned very black</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the fainter darkness, and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time he. managed to keep them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several times he fell, and once sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to his shoulders in the black ooze of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swamp, but succeeded in pulling him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self out. The chill of the night struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and his teeth began to chatter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, a small crescent of light ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared in a rift of the clouds and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to climb a tree to see if he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a glimpse of the river. A tall spruce</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ascended with much difficulty, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">once at the top he could see nothing, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he rested for a moment before begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning his downward journey, he discerned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably less than a mile away, a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickering light. He kept on peering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that direction and the light shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It must be the camp," he sp.id to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moon was showing more brightly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would soon be quite high and it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">help him to continue in the right direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coming down from the tree he picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the gun and the meat, and soon found</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat better going. Lighting an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other torch, he found that he still had</seg><seg type="columnLine">five matches. The air was still and cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he shivered as he went on. Once he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, thinking that he had heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange sound, but decided that it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been the hooting of an owl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time, lie must be getting pret-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty near the river and new courage came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. Falling over dead trees and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbling over rocks, tearing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangles of alders and vines, he suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out upon the shore of the longed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">for river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped, delighted, and wondered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   12	RR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whether he was above or below the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had left the canoe, but on</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking up - stream he saw a flickering</seg><seg type="columnLine">light upon the opposite shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could see his way fairly well now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but stopped suddenly, for in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the light, in the still cold air, arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mournful howl, prolonged, increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in intensity toward the finish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It's Paddy!

In the morning he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">it roar, just for the pleasure of it. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">did most of his cooking upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Annie Marie was getting better. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing was becoming quite easy, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on sunny days, during the afternoon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she sat under a tree, where she spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours gazing at the placid stretch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, and following with her eyes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall young man who, with his pipe ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lastingly going, was fussing with some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preparations for the trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One morning, as he awoke rather late,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was surprised to find her up. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lighted the fire in the little stove and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sitting by it. With a wonderfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">coarse needle and some thread she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mending a hole in one of his heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">woolen socks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Why, Anne Marie," he exclaimed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"what are you doing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned to him with a smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I could not lie down any more,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she replied. " I am better now. Time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get ready for a start."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " But you are not strong enough yet,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he objected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can sit'in the canoe. No work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We'll travel on easily. Get that much</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nearer to Lake St. John."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He reflected for a moment and thought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that it was a wise idea. If she could sit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a canoe it would do her no harm. At</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any rate, they could go on to the head</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the next portage and camp there. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she was not strong enough to walk across,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they could stay there for a day or two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Do you think we could start to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">day?" he asked eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Yes, we'll make ready now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With a joyful feeling he went to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">work, whistling and singing. His energy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemed to propagate itself to Paddy, who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">barked and scampered with delight when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he saw the tent being pulled down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Everything was ready in less than two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hours, including the time he took to go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">across the river to collect his snares,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which he would not leave behind. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">found four rabbits, which he brought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back in triumph. He was really very-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tired of rabbit, but Anne Marie enjoyed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them, and so did Paddy. There were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enough skins to make'a rough blanket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The canoe was rather heavily loaded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when the time came to start. He care-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fully led Anne Marie down to the shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vShe was very weak, and at first it seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as if her legs could only carry her a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very short way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She seemed surprised to realize it, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he assured her that this would soon wear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">away. He, got her comfortably ensconced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the bow of the canoe, and with a last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">look at the place they pushed off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' The journey was on again. It was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fine frosty morning ; the air was clear and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bright and a fair wind blew down the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">river. Pierre paddled strongly and with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">each sweep of the paddle the little craft,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">carried along by the current, went a good</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Again they were watching the shores</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that went by, and noted the indications</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of life along the river. There were ducks,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at times, rising before them a long way</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ahead. But most of the birds, never very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">numerous in that region, had already</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">departed. A couple of loons were swim-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ming about in one broad lakelike expanse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the river, and farther on a lone gull</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gave a rasping cry and sailed away from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the top of a great rock. Then the river</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">narrowed down again and became quite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rapid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">374</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You remember this portage?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anne Marie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I suppose so--why? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " The water is very rapid just before</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching the landing-place. It takes two</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fetch it safely. It would be easy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be carried over the falls. There is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place higher up where they land, at high</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. We must stop there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just as you say, Anne Marie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was nearly noon when they landed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pierre helped the girl out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe. She was pleased to find that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little more steady on her feet than</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they had started. Yet she was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to lie down with her back propped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the bundle of blankets, while Pierre</seg><seg type="columnLine">started a fire and began the never-ending</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiling of the kettle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made a strong stew of caribou</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat, with a little rice. With bread and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tea, this made a fine meal, and Anne</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marie ate with better appetite than she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had manifested for a long time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Let me see, how long is this port-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age?" he inquired between mouthfuls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was ever a surprise to her to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he never remembered exactly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">places over which he had already passed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He recognized everything, but was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit hazy until he reached them. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">deficient in the training which to her was</seg><seg type="columnLine">second nature, and she could hardly un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand that this wonderful man should</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie lacking in any faculty. But then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something out of the common, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be judged by the standards</seg><seg type="columnLine">applicable to her people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It is not far," she replied. " Few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred paces. But there is a hard hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get down. Don't try to carry too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he lit his pipe, and, in the pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his strength, piled up packs on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back until he carried about a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fifty pounds. He followed the path</seg><seg type="columnLine">which generations of Indians had worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the portage and soon came to a steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb that made him stop for a rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then again he went on and reached a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where the way led down a steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crumbling side hill, covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanty herbage everywhere but in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path, where the bare sand showed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered that he had puffed hard on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his upward journey when coming up</seg><seg type="columnLine">that place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly and carefully he made his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. The sand was loose and gave an</seg><seg type="columnLine">insecure footing, and whenever he slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few inches his pack would thump down</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard and give his neck a wrench. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally reached the bottom and placed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">load upon a flat rock, and rested a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">before going back. Two more journeys</seg><seg type="columnLine">consumed nearly an hour, leaving nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more to carry but the blankets and tent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the rifle and a small bag of pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What do you think, Anne Marie?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you want to tr-yJt? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She arose briskly, and he took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining bundles. Placing one arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">around her waist he started slowly. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">progressed steadily while they were on</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly level ground, and Pierre saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it gave her pleasure to feel that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting on so well. After reaching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill, however, she began to breathe hard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and soon stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's too much for you, is it?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With scanty breath she replied that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would be better in a minute, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down for a moment. She then rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, her teeth tightly clenched, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon her mouth was open wide in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to breathe. --!-</seg><seg type="columnLine">" I'll carry you," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lie bent down and with his right arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">encircled her knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Bend down," he directed her, " and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put your arms around my neck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did this so quickly that she had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to protest.

In contemplating</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">suburban service, as it is provided nowadays</seg><seg type="columnLine">with steam locomotives, one cannot help be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing impressed with the general second-hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edness of the equipment that is assigned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this department of the work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both cars and engines are too often of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">type that was common in through traffic as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as twenty or thirty years ago, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a distinctive type of suburban engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">is used at all, it. too, is one that has long</seg><seg type="columnLine">since become antiquated. The ability to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">and start quickly is one of the most important</seg><seg type="columnLine">features of this service, and why we are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting the advantage of that feature is very</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a type, the suburban locomotive has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been practically neglected during the past fif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen years, and that it is subject to improve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments that would make it proportionately as</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable to the service as are other improved</seg><seg type="columnLine">types of locomotives in their respective</seg><seg type="columnLine">classes of work, goes without saying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In England there has been in use for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time a type of four-cylinder compound</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherein the intercepting valve is controlled</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatically by the movement of the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse lever--this principle should prove valu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able in providing a three or four cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">compound suburban engine with the ability to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accelerate rapidity with the least attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the engineer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With engines embodying this feature and</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-weight cars, preferably vestibuled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without bulkheads, similar to those used in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Subway and Elevated service, improved con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions as regards suburban traffic on steam</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines would surely result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"THE FAST FREIGHT ON THE SOO."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN our April issue, we asked for the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">of " The Fast Freight 011 the Soo," which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is sometimes known as "An Ox Team Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Faster than a Freight on the Soo."
