of this gossip had reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears of Fred Erskine prior to his visit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago, and had done much to encourage</seg><seg

type="columnLine">rington, as has been seen, had afforded</seg><seg type="columnLine">material aid in this direction, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in accordance with the advice of the

type="columnLine">shops and several important offices of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pennsylvania Railroad To the railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of high or low degree, however,

prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and in such a case we may be pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that the bonds still are in the pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">session of the original thief On the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">-hand, if my son took them they probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">are in the hands of some other person to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom they have been given as security</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a loan It will be necessary, there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, for you first to learn by whom the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds were

will now tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the second phase of the affair of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the detectives are ignorant"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Then it will be- necessary for me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work also on the theory that the bonds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were

The work began with the sinking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two shafts, one on the Manhattan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one on the New Jersey shore, to provide</seg><seg

ahead The shield moved into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud irresistibly, but it showed a constant</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendency to rise to so marked a degree</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would not have been long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnels came up in the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river The more it rose the greater

STEAM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEFORE entering into a discussion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantages resulting from the use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">superheated steam, it is first necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">define it	,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Superheated steam is nothing more nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than very hot steam It is steam of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a higher temperature than that which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">attains in the boiler in coming to boiler</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This higher temperature cannot be ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained by adding heat to the boiler when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam is in contact with the water from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it is made but the additional heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">will merely serve to make more steam</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If, however, the steam is separated from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water and passed over very hot surfaces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will receive additional heat and will then</seg><seg type="columnLine">become superheated This is what is done</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a locomotive, the steam on its way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders being made to pass through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">superheater apparatus in which the tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture is higher than that of the steam and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it thus receives additional heat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What advantage is there in using this</seg><seg type="columnLine">very hot steam</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When steam enters a locomotive cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">it becomes cooled by coming in contact with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder walls, and it becomes further</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooled by performing work in the cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the steam is of ordinary temperature a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large amount of it is turned into water be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of this cooling process</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As this water has no power and does no</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, all the steam from which it is made</seg><seg type="columnLine">is wasted Furthermore, this water in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders is dangerous, because, as we all</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, if not released it causes broken cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der-heads, pistons, bent piston rpds, etc</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If superheated steam is used, all the heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">that has been added to it may be given up</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it is cooled down to the point of be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming water By adding sufficient heat to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steam, therefore, all the loss of power</seg><seg type="columnLine">which otherwise occurs can be prevented and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great saving in coal and water is thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">effected</seg><seg

type="columnLine">A NEW SPIKE --It is seldom that</seg><seg type="columnLine">patents 011 railroad spikes attract interest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but one, covered by patent No 942,658 De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cember 7 1909, issued to James T Nulty, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is so novel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">possesses such advantages that it cannot pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">without notice and commendation It is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spike which serves two purposes, and serves</seg><seg type="columnLine">them both well Instead of locating the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the spike at the upper end of the shank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr Nulty forms it at the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shank</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The head is similar to the ordinary spike</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and when the lower portion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shank is driven into a tie, the head will</seg><seg type="columnLine">engage and hold the base flange of a rail, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">does the ordinary spike head The " upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">story ' of the spike, so to speak, now per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms its function by being bent or driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">in toward the rail until its upper end bears</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the underside of the rail tread</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Thus the spike not only serves to hold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail in place upon the tie, but also serves to</seg><seg type="columnLine">brace the rail against turning over Such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spike will be decidedly advantageous 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">curves and at other danger points</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg
