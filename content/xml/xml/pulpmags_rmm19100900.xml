One thinks of a cinder pit</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a hole in the ground, but unless one is able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to imagine a very deep hole turned inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and upside down, the cinder pit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far from being a hole in the ground that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a mountain of A'olcanic ashes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of digging down for the cinders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few charges of dynamite, judiciously placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the big cliff, would bring down more</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinders than three crews could haul away in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over one hundred laborers were used in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work at the cinder pit; and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred took care of the unloading and bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasting at various locations along the right-</seg><seg type="columnLine">of-way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bart Goldie came onto the job as road-</seg><seg type="columnLine">master just after the pit had opened that</seg><seg type="columnLine">summer. After he found out what he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">against, he made his headquarters at the pit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making little side trips over the division,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping in close touch with the progress of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coming east one afternoon, a few days</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the pit had opened, I got an order at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ash Fork to set out my string, pick up all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the empty cinder flats in the yard, run to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cinder pit and tie up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, I said a few uncomplimentary</seg><seg type="columnLine">things about certain individuals connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the road, which found a unanimous in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dorsement from the entire crew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After showing our independence by taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty minutes more time than usual in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to eat and putting it down on the delay re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port in a bold, bad hand, we went out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffle the cars and make up our train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was turning dusk when we pulled in on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the siding at the pit and tied up for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. It was evident that we had drawn our</seg><seg type="columnLine">summer vacation; we were to be one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three crews in the hauling service for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, at least, and, I guess, even' one on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew felt rather bellicose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had reached the popping-off stage, my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, and, just as soon as the doghouse was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the clear, I started out to find the jefe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Mexicans call the big boss, and unload</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of my pent-up ire in his vicinity. As a</seg><seg type="columnLine">result I met Bart Goldie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found Bart engaged in a rather extraor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary pastime down at the end of the spur,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a dozen outfit cars served as temporary</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters for the foreign population.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seems that Goldie's education, while it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was really college-made, was mighty weak on</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreign languages, especially Spanish. Quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally he had been forced to make up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">linguistic deficiency by a generous use of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, so generous, in fact, that his fist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when neatly folded and placed in a position</seg><seg type="columnLine">near one's nose, looked like a Gould knuckle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had come in contact with Romero Gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cia's left lamp. When Romero had suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciently returned to consciousness as to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">positive that he had not been caught beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cave-in from the cinder cliff, he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">take kindly to the roadmaster's method of</seg><seg type="columnLine">argument, and planned to take summary re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Romero, unlike the average care-free Mexi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can, was of fair size and of sullen and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiant disposition. He ruled his outfit through</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute force, and had been a source of trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before Bart Goldie came on the job, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stirred up dissension on the least provo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seems that Goldie had insisted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gang was not loading the flats with a rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonable degree of speed. When he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">Romero sitting in the shade smoking a cig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arette, he motioned him back to work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Romero became sullen, and his sullenness</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread with strange contagion to the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gang, and, during the course of the after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon, Romero, acting as ring-leader and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spokesman, informed the new jefe on cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain little matters and endeavored to run in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bluff. Goldie had, in his rebuttal, intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced a knockout argument in the form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right fist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was several hours before the 660</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled in on the siding with the cinder flats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, quite naturally, when I walked around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outfit cars and found a six-footer doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a juggling act with a track gage and a Mexi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can, I wasn't sure whether I had suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped in on a Nicaraguan revolution or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaudeville performance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Goldie thoroughly convinced several of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gang that a gage-iron can be used for</seg><seg type="columnLine">other things besides measuring the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">between rails, and that night they took Ro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mero and two of his mutineers down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terminal for treatment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With three of the gang bowled over, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of them happened to remember that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortillas and frijoles were ready. Wifey</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be awful angry if she had to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">ON SHORT TIME.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">605</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">supper on them, and a prairie dog didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have them beat very much when it came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting into the clear in a hurry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the show was over Goldie turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a'bout and saw me standing near. Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light wasn't extra good, and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtlessly picked up a side-stake as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you want? I'm running this</seg><seg type="columnLine">job! " It was evident that Goldie was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">foaming a little. I promptly dropped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side-stake and hastened to assure him that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all appearances, he was running the</seg><seg type="columnLine">job and that I had no desire to make ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plication for his place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he realized that I was just a harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less conductor, and if not thoroughly civi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lized at least partially domesticated, he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Guess I'm getting nervous," he remarked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Every time I hear a fellow coming up be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind me I think he wants to play mumble-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peg on my back with a butcher knife. Talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">about your football games. Bucking center</seg><seg type="columnLine">is parlor pastime alongside this job. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang will work the way I want, or I'll put</seg><seg type="columnLine">them all in the hospital! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the way he said that last sentence</seg><seg type="columnLine">which prejudiced me against Goldie. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something of the bully in his manner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That evening, over at the mess-room when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were planning the work for the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, he remarked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To-morrow morning, we will leave here</seg><seg type="columnLine">with forty loads and--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have never hauled more than thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five with one of these hogs," I interrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll take forty loads," he continued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as if he had not heard me. "We can</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away from here by six o'clock, get down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the curve below Riordan and have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinders unloaded before the passenger-train</seg><seg type="columnLine">runs us in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, after having been accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leaving the pit at seven o'clock--as we did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first season it was operated--that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour made me very enthusiastic. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never tried to unload even thirty flats on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riordan curves, ahead of the morning pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger, and I made a mental note that Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goldsworthy, our new roadmaster, had some</seg><seg type="columnLine">few things to learn in operating cinder trains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the next morning, when he came down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost kicked in the caboose-door, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that we were going to leave at six</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock with forty loads just as he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's just what we did, and we unloaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the string and were well in the clear when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passenger came along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After I had been working with him for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">week, I learned that when Goldie said: "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">are going to do so-and-so," you could take it</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a part of the Standard Book of Rules.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While he evidently knew more about college</seg><seg type="columnLine">football than he did of train tonnage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinder plows, he had decided views about</seg><seg type="columnLine">ballasting track and improving a right-of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had been working about ten days and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it began to look as if the train-master had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost us all together. I began to feel a long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for an emery-wheel and a real bath with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sandpaper rub-down. We had been eat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing canned corn and corn in the can, three</seg><seg type="columnLine">times a day, until every time one of us tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to yell it sounded like the tin solo at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">charivari.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the 660 got the idea that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a street sprinkler and went to leaking like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sieve, so, for the good of the order, I wired</seg><seg type="columnLine">the train-master to run us in to Winslow for</seg><seg type="columnLine">general repairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing hurts a train-master more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">light mileage. The Old Man, rather than let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us run from the pit to the terminal with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine and a caboose, sent a message order-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing us to run extra and do whatever work</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goldie might find for us on the way in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a slow order out on bridge 356,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Cosnino Creek, and it seems that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloudburst up in the mountains had sent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">torrent of water down that way, doing quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little damage to the embankments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will take five cars of cinders," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked Goldie. " Pick up the section gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Cosnino and see what we can do at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, puttering around there for sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral hours, with an appetite which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made business mighty good at the Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vey House gnawing at my vitals, particular-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly appealed to me. But we did it just be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause Goldie said we would.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we got down to the bridge, we found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water hurling down a ravine which</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralleled the track for a half mile. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">it emptied into Cosnino Creek at the bridge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had taken away enough of the bank to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">two telegraph poles down, and the wires</seg><seg type="columnLine">were swishing about in the current.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sent back a flag, and Goldie began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">exercise his sign language for the benefit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our foreign passengers, with the result that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were shortly working a bit faster than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had ever worked before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I acted as a sort of straw boss over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unloading, Goldie took four of the Mexi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cans down to see if he could get the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">606</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">graph wires out of the water. While the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water in the ravine was not more than waist</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep, it was Tunning swift, and Cosnino</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creek was really a torrent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After hauling and tugging for some time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goldie managed to get the wires free from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poles, with a view of fastening them on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the superstructure of the bridge, until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">linemen could come out and restring them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mexicans, being by nature very hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tile to a bath, didn't take kindly to going</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water, but finally three of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">either persuaded or frightened into wading</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to attach a rope to the wires so that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be pulled over to the bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I guess the natives didn't understand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature of a telegraph wire, for when they got</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to them, instead of putting the rope about</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, it looked much easier to just take hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pull them in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They drew the grand surprise. The minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hands closed about the wires, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bunch of yells that would have made an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apache war-cry sound as gentle as a bene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diction. Two of those Mexicans came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the water, scrambled up the bank, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started down the track. I'm a goat if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have caught either one of them with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prairie type on a down-grade. Most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time they were running wheel to wheel, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">when one would get ahead, the other would</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach for him and pull him back, and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ever see two Mexicans; just touching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high spots, headed toward the line, don't try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop them, for they are some scared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The third one furnished the real excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and, incidentally, obliterated my prej-</seg><seg type="columnLine">udice against Bart Goldie.

But the bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lam of noise coming up the track awakened</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to the fact that there was really some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing unusual going on, and they saw their</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger in time to jump out of the way. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hundred men at</seg><seg type="columnLine">work on the tracks, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was hurt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At N i n e t y - Sixth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street the track leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel, and at One</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hundred and Sixth --</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few seconds'</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel for the speeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine--it is supported</seg><seg type="columnLine">on an elevated structure</seg><seg type="columnLine">far above the streets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harlem. Approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">One Hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sixth Street from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north, on the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">track, was the Pough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keepsie local, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already left One</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hundred and Twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fifth Street Station be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the engine wrent</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild.

If he listened to the clamor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the older men behind him, he felt certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ditched engine would jump the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the embankment and smash down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Devil and the Deep Sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That he dared not risk, for he knew not</seg><seg type="columnLine">how many people might be in the street be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. But the alternative was hardly better.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A picture of a head-on collision with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poughkeepsie local flashed into his mind as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the older men kept calling to him frantically:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ditch her! Ditch her!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was one chance left, and he meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take it. If he failed, it meant everlast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing disgrace. Success lay only in providing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for other troubles farther up the line, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be time enough to think of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other troubles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not to follow the unanimous demands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others took strength 'of purpose, but Lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle, although he was only twenty-three years</seg><seg type="columnLine">old, did not hesitate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The situation was, in fact, worse than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others realized. There was almost a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute to get the Poughkeepsie local to One</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hundred and Sixth Street, where it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched to another track. If this could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, all well and good; but here a third</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty blocked his way. A dead train on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other track was coming in on passenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">schedule, and if it reached One Hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sixth Street at the same time as the Pough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keepsie local, the cross-over would result in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another and hardly less disastrous collision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, within the second that all these alter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives shot through his mind, in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cries of " Ditch her! Ditch her! " he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up. Mind your own business!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he roaredt though afterward he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know he had opened his mouth. His mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the order he was about to give to</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Kid" McManus, the tower man at One</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hundred and Sixth Street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">One Wreck Averted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Meanwhile McManus was doing some</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking on his own part. All the alterna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives that passed through Little's mind shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hot waves through his own. He, like all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other operators, had received the original</seg><seg type="columnLine">message, and he knew that there was no time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lose. He could see the Poughkeepsie</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">local so close to him that it hardly seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe to throw the switch before it, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had received orders to clear the track, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At full speed the local took the cross-over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shook and swayed as if it was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the rails, but to McManus it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be crawling. Down the track he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wild engine coming, and made bets with</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself as to whether the local or the engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">would win. As the last car passed he swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lever and closed the track before the wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine.

Now, however, I did so. A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who loves flowers is always worth cultiva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting; and as old Briggs circled the flower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed, watering-pot in hand, it was evident he</seg><seg type="columnLine">belonged in this category.

But it was his eyes that com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled my attention. Just ordinary brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, the casual observer might have said--</seg><seg type="columnLine">only there was in them an indefinable some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, a strange mingling of sadness and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectancy as he leaned over the flowers, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of all a haunted, apprehensive look that</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not fit well with his years or occupa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first our conversation was desultory, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man was shy, and hesitated about voi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cing his opinions when he was uncertain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">how they were going to be received. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">little by little, he gained confidence, and, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who live much alone are wont to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the)- have a sympathetic listener, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to talk freely. He had been with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">E.

Some of them had occurred with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his own knowledge, but most had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">related to him by others. He did not pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tend to vouch for these last, although it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent, from the way he watched for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect on me, that he more than half be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told of the odd and, at times, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">human freaks and '"failings of engines; of</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-brakes that set without the hand of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer upon the lever -- Briggs had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">an engineer himself until his eyesight had</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed him; of engines that refused to steam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though the gage showed plenty of pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, and of vicious vampire-engines that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had crushed the life out of their masters, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could always be depended on to do the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I listened to the old man as one listens to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yarns of some venerable tar, allowing always</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proverbial grain.of salt; yet, so simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">and direct was his speech, so obvious his be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief in much he was narrating, that I for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore showing any incredulity. I must con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fess that, during the telling, I half believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them myself, and even now, in the light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">later events, I cannot afford to be too cynical.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From time to time, as he talked, old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Briggs rose from where we sat and glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously up the track in the opposite direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion from that in which the local was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. It was evident that, for all his volu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility, his mind was on other things. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he returned to his seat he resumed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation only by the exercise of consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able mental effort. He fidgeted constantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seemed uneasy and apprehensive; one</seg><seg type="columnLine">might even have said expectant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Are you expecting a north-bound train</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the local ? " I inquired curiously on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the occasion of his last look up the track.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No-o," he answered hesitatingly; "at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least--not exactly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I beg pardon," I returned; "but I ..</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ENGINE'S LEAP.	643</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, from the way you kept looking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the track, that you must be expecting some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made no reply.

Among them was Abraham Lincoln.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It has only recently become known that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln belonged among the empire builders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and decided the fate of the first transconti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nental railroad with the cities that have</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown up along its tracks.' A chance meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing between Lincoln and General Dodge</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought this about. In the book recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">published and quoted herein, General Dodge</seg><seg type="columnLine">shows how Lincoln first pictured the rails</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid over the emigrant trail, and afterward</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided that route for the Union Pacific.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Back of it is a little history. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rock Island gave up its Pacific projects,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it lost the services of its most daring engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neer, Peter A. Dey. He decided to go farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his own account, and, crossing the Mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sissippi into Iowa, began the survey of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mississippi and Missouri Railroad. Logic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally that was the beginning of the Union</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pacific, although it afterward became part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Rock Island. With Dey was Dodge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The First Transcontinental Line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All sorts of surveys for railroads to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pacific had been made, but Dey and Dodge</seg><seg type="columnLine">had an idea that the best one lay due west</seg><seg type="columnLine">of where they were working. Dodge was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more foot-loose of the two, and he went for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to investigate, crossing the Missouri</seg><seg type="columnLine">River at Council Bluffs, in 1853, to the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Omaha, then an Indian camp, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dodge crossed at that point and deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined the future of Omaha and the route</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Union Pacific. Dodge felt that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was making history, and he became so anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious to reach the Platte, to see whether it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was really the feasible route he believed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be, that he left his escort and struck out</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the prairie by himself into what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a hostile Indian country. Afterward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Union Pacific was laid almost in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony's tracks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">During the six or eight years that Dodge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had made his headquarters at Council Bluffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">he worked farther and farther west until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had mapped out a route through the Rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Returning, in 1859, from an expedition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was sitting on the steps of the old Pacific</seg><seg type="columnLine">House, in Council Bluffs, when he was ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached by a tall, kindly stranger, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduced himself as a lawyer from Illinois.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger asked several questions about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Western country, and Dodge answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he had imparted all the information it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken him years to get. But he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of it at the time, as he was accus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomed to explaining the prairie country to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers, and the matter would never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been recalled had it not been tor an incident</seg><seg type="columnLine">which occurred in the midst of the Civil</seg><seg type="columnLine">War, four years later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln Maps the Route.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dodge, the engineer, had become General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dodge and was in command of a district in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mississippi, when, one day, he received a</seg><seg type="columnLine">message from General Grant to proceed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once to Washington and report to President</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the heat of war, General Dodge had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of things that he feared might not</seg><seg type="columnLine">look well from the President's point of view,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he anticipated trouble. Wondering all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way what was in store for him, lie had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no inkling of the purpose of the journey until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he arrived. Then, as he entered the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">House, he was greeted cordially by the Illi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nois lawyer with whom he had been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly and confidential.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The former conversation was brought up</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately, the President telling .General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dodge that it was responsible for the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting.

Then he told General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dodge that the bill for the construction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Union Pacific had passed Congress, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was his duty to determine the route so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it concerned the eastern terminus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Several towns on the Missouri River,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">writes General Dodge, "were competing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terminus, but Mr. Lincoln practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled the question in favor of the location I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recommended."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That location was Omaha, only a few years</seg><seg type="columnLine">previously the Indian camp from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dodge turned his pony's nose westward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Union Pacific was so named because</seg><seg type="columnLine">704</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it was to bind the Union together, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized its purpose the sooner on account of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Central Pacific, which met it half way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work of another dreamer--Theodore D.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judah.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of all the prairie and mountain country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no part lured the early voyagers more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fascinating region southwest of Kansas--</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the bloody Point of Rocks over the Santa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fe trail into what was then known as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great American Desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Visions of the Santa Fe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even to-day, in spite of the fact that it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">crisscrossed with railroad tracks, it has the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same strong appeal to the imagination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man most interested in its possibilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those days was Colonel Cyrus K.

The soil of Kansas had hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">been turned, and buffaloes still roamed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, but there was no stopping Colonel Holli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day and his day-dream.

Instead of going to Europe, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr, and Mrs. Clivers register at the Continental Hotel on Fifth Avenue, where Winters discovers them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He is mad with jealousy and'hatred for Clivers and forces his presence on Meriel as she enters the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel alone. He reproaches her and threatens her husband. He overhears two men in conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hotel lobby, and as they let fall the word "Clivers" he determines to know more about them. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, who proves to be Vincent Wilson, is stopping at the hotel, and to him Winters sends up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">card. He is received, and explains the reason of his intrusion. Wilson is eager to hear his story and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in turn, tells of his interest in the Clivers. Winters is persuaded to introduce Wilson to Meriel as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she is lunching alone, her husband having left for Louisville to be away a few days. Wilson is also</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to meet Clivers, and arranges with Winters and Tom Tracie, a detective, to be in the hotel lobby</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Sunday evening at the hour Clivers is expected to return.

However, it is not in Wilson's plan to let Clivers know he has been discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered, and so he greets him by his real name, Blander, and seemingly takes it for granted that he is in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York on a visit. Blander is suspicious of Wilson, but can find no foundation for his suspicion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he ascertains that he, Wilson, is stopping at the Continental, and this convinces him that he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">being spied upon, and he determines to get Wilson out of the way by fair means or foul. The fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery, however, is so great that an attack of apoplexy seizes him and he is confincd to his room for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several days.

The proper distance between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rails, or, in other words, the gage, is a point on which men may honestly differ.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The problem is like an indeterminate decimal upon which one might figure forever</seg><seg type="columnLine">without reaching a final conclusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    The late E.

Forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">standard-gage locomotives and a few stan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dard-gage cars were ordered, and arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were made to alter 28 locomotives and</seg><seg type="columnLine">700 cars from broad gage to standard, at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost of $3,600 per locomotive, $150 per pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger-coach, and $45 per freight-car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saturday, July 22, 1871, all broad-gage</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling-stock was disposed so as to clear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">track at midnight. At dawn on Sunday, July</seg><seg type="columnLine">23, the work of changing the track from</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad to standard gage was begun. At 11</seg><seg type="columnLine">a.m. the entire main line and Louisville</seg><seg type="columnLine">branch, altogether more than 400 miles, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was a remarkable feat, which de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded system and discipline of a pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">high order.

One broad-gage push-car</seg><seg type="columnLine">was kept ahead of the work, and a standard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gage car followed. The best record made by</seg><seg type="columnLine">any crew that day was 5 miles of track</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed in 5]/2 hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That settled the broad-gage railroad in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States. Now the only broad gage, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as I know, is the Mount Washington rack</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, which is of 5 feet 7 inches gage through-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out its entire length of 3 1-3 miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The railroads of the United States to-day</seg><seg type="columnLine">are all df standard gage, with double tracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sidings spaced 13 feet apart from center</seg><seg type="columnLine">to center.

But, first, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall have to explain a little. Jim did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">work for the P. S. and N. B. If you had</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned such a possibility to him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have assured you--in terms admitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">no debate--that he did not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The road Jim worked for was the swellest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the swell transcontinental highways. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">road-bed was only equaled by its signaling</seg><seg type="columnLine">system; its signaling system by its electric-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted cars; its electric-lighted cars by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-speed locomotives, and its high-speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">locomotives by Jim; while all were perfect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even perfect road-bed, perfect equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and perfect engineers must, in this im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect world, be handicapped in operation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the handicap of the Southern Trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">continental was the P.

It is regard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed as the most important step taken in many years</seg><seg type="columnLine">in furtherance of the cordial relation between these</seg><seg type="columnLine">two countries, and is taken also as an indication of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spirit with which the United States and Canada</seg><seg type="columnLine">are to work out their question of reciprocity. This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first formal move ever made in this country to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the regulation of international railroad rates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The preliminary step taken by the two govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments consists in the appointment of Martin A.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knapp, chairman of the United States Interstate</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commerce Commission, and J. P. Mabee, chairman</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Canada's Railroad Commission, as a committee</seg><seg type="columnLine">to consider the advisability of the creation of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a commission. The two chairmen are to meet at</seg><seg type="columnLine">an early date, and report back to their governments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is little doubt in Washington that they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">report in favor of the international commission.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The actual creation of the commission will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result either of the treaty agreement between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two countries, or of concurrent legislation by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">countries, or, possibly, both.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If an international commission results, it will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed partly of Canadians and partly of Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cans. The powers possessed by the Railroad Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission of Canada are broader and more compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hensive than those now possessed by the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">commission. The Canadian Railroad Commission,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is said, is practically able to fix rates, but the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">power of the international commission as applied</seg><seg type="columnLine">to American roads would have to fall considerably</seg><seg type="columnLine">short of this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such a movement would develop railroad traffic</seg><seg type="columnLine">between Canada and the United States. The traffic</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the border, especially in Minnesota and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northwestern States, has been increasing by bounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the last few years, and it is the belief that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">near future will see a further marked development</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Interstate Commerce Commission of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States and the Canadian Railroad Commis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, acting individually, practically control inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">national rates between the two countries. The In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terstate Commerce Commission, in the case of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate over an American road to a point in Canada,</seg><seg type="columnLine">compels the railroad to file not only the rate to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of destination, but the proportion of the rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged to the border. The commission thus in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sists upon the rate to the border being just and rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonable, and the Railroad Commission of Canada</seg><seg type="columnLine">exercises its power after the road crosses the line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under present conditions of individual effort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, neither the United States commission nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Canadian commission has been able to compel</seg><seg type="columnLine">the maintenance of through, or joint rates, to inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">national points. It is in this connection that rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road experts expect the greatest benefits to flow</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a working agreement between the two govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments.

He left the train with as happy a smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though the eighty dollars in his pocket was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not all the ready cash he had in the world, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ensconced himself in the bus of the most ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pensive hotel in the city.

He walked around</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at the pictures and feeling the plush</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the furniture. He noticed that the suit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">case reposed on a costly inlaid table, snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">it off, and wandered about looking at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">details of the apartments.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seating himself at the mahogany desk, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">inscribed a brief note to Mr. Davis, informing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that he, William P.

Twice he had to restrain</seg><seg type="columnLine">an almost unconquerable impulse to go look</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davis up in a meek and humble spirit be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitting the situation, and express his abject</seg><seg type="columnLine">willingness to accept the proffered position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At a quarter before two the next afternoon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ordered a box of the finest cigars the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">afforded. Stuffing half a dozen of them into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket, he placed the box conspicuously</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the center table. The next fifteen minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">went like hours. As the clock on the mantel</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed at two he began smoking to quiet his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves. At three minutes past two Mr. Davis's</seg><seg type="columnLine">card was brought to him by a gloomy-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellboy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Very good," he said, putting a dollar in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy's hand.

"What if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should go?" He started for the bell, but re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained himself and paced the room, back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth, back and forth. Four minutes, five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, six minutes, seven--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strain was too much, and as the eighth</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute passed, he seized the phone and asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have his caller brought up to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While pacing back and forth waiting, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw two prosperous looking men pass his open</seg><seg type="columnLine">door from a room just beyond. They met</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davis and the bellboy just as they turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner into the corridor. One of them he</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized as the president of the North Cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tral Railroad, whom he knew by sight. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that Davis bowed and turned to stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">after them with a peculiar expression on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, and the thought flashed through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind that they would naturally be supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have come from his rooms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He met Davis with outstretched hand, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they sized each other up with quick, shrewd</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances. Strange to say, he was perfectly cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">and indifferent now that the crisis was upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Davis was puzzled and interested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Sorry to have kept you waiting," ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained O'Donnell, with magnetic winsome-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, " but it was unavoidable.

"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davis's eyebrows went up a trifle as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted the name on the box and took in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expensive overelegance of the suite. He set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled himself comfortably in an easychair</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing O'Donnell, who at once plunged into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main subject between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Mr. Davis, about your offer--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistant attorneyship, wasn't it?

He smoked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">much cheaper brand himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From what we heard of you we thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would about fit the position and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">position would about fit you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Donnell smiled enigmatically.

His mind was busily</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to readjust itself to the unexpected dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery that O'Donnell was a wealthier and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a higher grade man than he had thought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find him. The rooms must cost twenty or thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day, and evidently he smoked the expensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigars before them commonly, as a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone from the box. He looked like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of a man who would regard such luxuries</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely as an incident. He assuredly was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sybarite. He had every appearance of being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp, reliable, forceful business man, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse sense. He had the reputation of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly posted on railroad law, and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">having almost a genius for persuasion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I heard you had some ideas about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">joint freight rates on the Overland," suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davis tentatively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yes.

To such a man as P. T. Barnum</seg><seg type="columnLine">Checks would have been a mint.

He could tell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time of day, your age, pick out spurious coin</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that coined at one of the United States</seg><seg type="columnLine">mints, and at cards he was a corker. Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ready at all times to wager that Checks</seg><seg type="columnLine">would win three games of casino out of every</seg><seg type="columnLine">five he played, no matter who might play the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How .did he do it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 don't know, nor did any one else, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was Jim, and he would never tell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many a time have I seen Jim put a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of pieces of fractional currency on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, and then say:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Checks, suppose I gave you a half-dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar and told you to go out and purchase two</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a half pounds of steak at ten cents the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound, how much change would you bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to me ?

The first time I saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">do this trick I was going out on the O. R.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and N. eight o'clock train. There were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of other traveling men with me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been telling them of Checks and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful powers.

Pierre slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, and the girl, who was then behind him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">called out to him to take care. He half</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to reassure her, but again his foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped and like a flash he was over the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the portage, clutching wildly at branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and snow-covered rocks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl threw herself flat upon the path,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, advancing her head and shoulders over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the precipitous edge, looked down. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, lying upon some snow that covered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat rock, jutting over the torrent. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than thirty feet below her, and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no answer when she called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She never could have explained how she</seg><seg type="columnLine">got down beside him. Clinging to roots</seg><seg type="columnLine">and snow-laden branches, resting her feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon projecting bits of rock, she descended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to where he had fallen and flung herself up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him, chafing his hands and imploring</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She decided that he must be dead, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light went out of her world. She sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down by him. She never could carry him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the path again, and it was the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">A HEART OF THE NORTH.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">751</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her life as well as his. She would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to bury him. He would stay there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would watch him, and the hunger would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, and the cold would make her sleepy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she would not fight against it, but al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low the mati-manitous (the evil spirits)</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had prevailed against the tishe-mani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tous (the good spirits) to have their way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for she cared no longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was a separation, but not the one she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had feared; and, dully, she thought that per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps it was just as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had been beaten--trapped, like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild creatures the men brought back -- and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a natural ending. Like them she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would await the coming of the Evil One who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had set the snare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paddy, left above in the path, howled</seg><seg type="columnLine">dolefully, for he knew that everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong. His voice touched something in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's heart, some fiber long attuned and never</seg><seg type="columnLine">before made to vibrate. She broke into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mournful cry and threw herself upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prostrate form. She kissed the beloved face</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly, again and again, and held it in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, as if the great Windego of the Falls</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been ready to snatch Pierre from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and disappear with him forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She noticed a movement of his chest. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes and looked about him, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">realizing what had happened. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the girl bending over him, and noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her tears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took several long breaths, sought for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hand and kept it within his, as if find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing comfort in it. Finally he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That came near being the end, Anne</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded, and looked about her. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">few feet farther on, there would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to prevent his falling in the grind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing turmoil of the wild waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she sat there in silence, she was once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more the shy, taciturn daughter of Indians.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her face was inscrutable, the love light gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of her eyes, her lips no longer quiver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Yet within her there was a heart beat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wildly with joy, and she realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been in Hades and had come out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It was a knockout," he said. " I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead to the world. Let's take an account</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stock and see what's broken. It's either</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head or my foot--or both."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt his head, upon which a large lump</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rising.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " A good thing it's a hard one, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick blanket cap helped a lot. I must try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand up. Hallo, what's the matter with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my foot ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was trying to rise, but this gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">such terrific pain that he nearly fainted</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and he collapsed, discouraged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I can't stand on it. It's surely broken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or badly sprained, and there's no more walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for me. I'll have to send for an ambu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lance," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His own incongruous thought revived his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits. He got up on his hands and knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must get out of this. I'll manage to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawl, somehow," he said. "Just see if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is any way of getting back to the path."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again she looked. They were on a flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock, and a little farther on a great log,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast there by the spring freshets, bridged</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a space that separated them from other</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks, above which protruded some scraggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees that had grown in the earth, washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into crevices. She got astride the log, push-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the snow away with her hands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed over. From rock to rock she reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place where the trees grew. Just above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them there was a steep incline that reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the path. By pulling oneself up by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their slender trunks, one could reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">portage, but it was a hard job.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She returned and explained the situation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still on his hands and knees he followed her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">got across the log, and, with the girl's help,</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to get over the rocks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the strength of his arm he managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull himself up the incline to where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees grew, and finally reached the path</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laid down, exhausted and dizzy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had taken him over an hour, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">every step he had found the girl's shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for him to lean on. Twice she actu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally lifted him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anne Marie cleared a place of snow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lay down. All that the girl could think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of then was the universal solace of her peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple--a cup of hot tea. She made it, strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">and black, and he was comforted. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards away she found a place where the tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be pitched. She attended to every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, deftly as usual, and Pierre crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his blankets, shivering, while she</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooked their supper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young man could eat a little, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taddy, as usual, was ravenous; but Anne</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marie, looking over the provisions that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, drank much tea and ate sparingly. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore entering the tent for the night, she knelt</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoutly and prayed earnestly by the flicker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing light of the camp-fire, for she realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were in sore straits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she came in, she suggested that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierre should take off his boot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">752</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " We'll have to cut it," he answered. " I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could never stand to have it pulled of. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps we might just unlace it. It might</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She unlaced the boot for him, but it did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not relieve the pain. He feared to take it</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, knowing he would not be able to put it</seg><seg type="columnLine">on again. He decided that if it was only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad sprain the boot might prevent the swell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and support the ankle to some extent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left it on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've got to go on, Anne Marie," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asserted doggedly the next morning. " I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon bear that pain as to sit in this tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the food goes and the cold gets worse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm willing to stay here if you want to go on</seg><seg type="columnLine">without me, and you can send me help when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you get to the first falls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well," she said; "I'll leave you the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent and the food, and will be back as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a bit! You must take the tent. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can build me a little lean-to. Then you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must take three of the blankets and half the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grub that's left."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She would not hear of taking the tent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he acknowledged that she was right</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she said its weight would make some</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference in her speed. Then she showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that she could get food as soon as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the first falls, while he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remain until she returned with more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this time there was left but about three</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds of meat, less than a pound of bacon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough flour for four or five flapjacks, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a cupful of beans. There was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty of tea and tobacco.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was soon ready to start, with a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the food wrapped up in her blankets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the waterproof cloth, with which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">might make herself a shelter in case she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to camp out. Just then she decided that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the present camping-place was bad. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a side hill, far from the water. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be better to have it lower, near the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">-where he could see down its course. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved the tent nearly a hundred yards to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a better place, and Pierre managed to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">it by leaning upon her shoulder with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he rebelled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here, Anne Marie! I can't do it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd get the horrors sitting down here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting two or three days. There isn't much</seg><seg type="columnLine">left to carry. I'll take my share of the grub</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blankets and leave all the rest. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel on as fast as you can, but I'll follow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill make crutches."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said the girl decisively. "How can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you use the stick snow-shoes? You would</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop somewhere in the snow, or go through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hole in the river. You will freeze to death</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll worry to death if I'm left here," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">objected meekly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Then we go together," she answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again- she packed up the tent, the blank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ets and the food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was hardly' more than one good back</seg><seg type="columnLine">load and she swung it to her head with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tump-line. Before this she had made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crutch--a mere stick with two spreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches cut short--within the fork of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could place his armpit. She tied a ski</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his sound foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pierre, at times, rested one hand upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her shoulder. Whenever his foot touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground he was in pain, but gritted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth and went on. It took them half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour to go a few hundred yards. His un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">injured foot slipped once, and he tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save himself with the sore one. The pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so keen and fierce that he had to sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't do it, nia cherie," he acknowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the first time that he had ever used</seg><seg type="columnLine">a term of endearment to her, and she wept</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she knelt by him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Oh, I knew you could not do it. Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience," she implored. " I can get there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and back by to-morrow night or the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon. Please have patience. I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">come for you with plenty to eat. I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring men and dogs.

Please</seg><seg type="columnLine">have patience."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In her excitement she had taken his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hers, as she implored him. She was pet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting it and finally she kissed it--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffering man, weary and broken with pain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a tear coming. He took the fine, dusky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-bred little head within his hands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kissed her for the first time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Go, my dear. May Heaven be with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you! " he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tent was pitched once more. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had spread out his blankets and placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cooking things and plenty of wood near</seg><seg type="columnLine">at hand, she started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paddy followed her for a moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then went back to his master.

She tried to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dog to stay behind, knowirfg he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be well cared for, but he pleaded so, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed him to come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He will be glad to see you; he loves</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," she told Paddy, sadly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man promised to start at once; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt sure that the next night, or on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning after, he would be at the Chute du</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anne Marie felt stronger. She had bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowed a pair of regular snow-shoes and trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eled swiftly. She ran on for an hour until</seg><seg type="columnLine">it began to snow hard. Soon she saw nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a mist of heavy falling flakes, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather grew somewhat warmer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All day she journeyed, but had to use a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good deal of caution. Her former tracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were obliterated, and in many places the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treacherous ice was covered. But with un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erring instinct she kept on. With the heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ier load she carried she was unable to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite as good time; still, she felt that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could accomplish the journey by nightfall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she stopped at noon she felt very</seg><seg type="columnLine">weary, but had accomplished more than half</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the journey. She was not very hungry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet she ate a little. Notwithstanding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">added hardship of pain, she kept on and on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until, at times, she was dazed with the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanses of snow; until it seemed that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">never would be an end to them--that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting her way along to some goal that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">always receding and never could be reached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet the well-known portages went by,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she knew again every great blasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree that arose gaunt and sad above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black line of the living ones. She recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">every great snow-covered boulder along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the river; the cliffs, the low shores--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vast places where the water widened</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the shoals, and the narrow ones where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">raged through rocky canons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally she came in sight of the prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised land. A long way off, as the light was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just beginning to grow fainter, she saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little tent. She uttered a long, ululating cry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping that he might hear. But nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred, and she ran on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, she saw him crawling out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent on his hands and knees. He waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand at her, and she hurried on as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed of wings. Now she was hardly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards away from him and paid no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more attention to her footsteps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To be near him once more, to hear his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, to give him food, to comfort him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pain--what happiness!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ice was bad at that place, owing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fierce volume of water that rail under</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, coming from the great falls just above.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several times it cracked under her, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid no heed, and suddenly it broke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an effort to save herself she threw her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self forward, and the bundle she was car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rying fell and disappeared in the loose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slushy ice that was nothing but a death-trap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately she only partly sank. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes and the loose ice partly kept her from</seg><seg type="columnLine">going under, and she managed to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambling on until, on her hands and knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she reached solid ice once more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It all happened so suddenly that she was '</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe again before Pierre had managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take more than a few painful steps in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She ran toward him, wet and weeping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " The food! " she cried; " the food! I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing you plenty--now it is gone! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put an arm around her neck, and pat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted her cheek, as if she had been a sorrow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind," he said. "Thank Heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en, you didn't go under. Indeed, I am happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see you safe and well. I have been very</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely without you, Ou-memeou."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she could hardly be comforted. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wept as he made her go under the tent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take off the clothes that were freezing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. She was soon wrapped up in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankets, and he built a roaring fire just</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the tent, and hung her clothes as near</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as he could with safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She told him the simple story of her jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To-morrow night they will be here, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sledge and dogs, and more food.

" There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty little left."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I could start back again to-morrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning," she proposed. "Then I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not need food till night, and at the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls there is plenty to eat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, don't leave me again, Anne Marie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is enough for a meal or two, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we won't have to wait long. The time was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very hard without you. I sometimes feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">something would happen to you. It kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">me awake during the night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pierre shivered as he thought again of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had endured in her absence -- the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">day during which he had worried lest some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing should happen to her, and the fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain he had suffered from his injured ankle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the night--tenfold longer, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">A HEART OF THE NORTH.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">755</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ending--when the cold had bitten him sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agely and the suffering had grown worse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horrors evoked by his imagination had</seg><seg type="columnLine">crucified him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had seen her sinking through the ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disappearing, and the thought that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would perish alone was nothing compared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the feeling that Ou-memeou would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">again be near him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning had come at length, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">booming of the great falls had seemed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a portentous voice calling out for lives, lives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more lives. When the snow fell again, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white fall, something that blotted out liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing things. It hid the world and stifled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries of dying men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was thankful indeed to see her again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no more fear, nothing but the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Ou-memeou was near him, that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">chafe her cold hands in his, that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">kiss her dear face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he was shocked to see how dreadfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn she was. Even during her illness up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river she had not looked so wan. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusky Indian complexion had become of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grayish hue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the next day they took the bit of meat</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was left, boiled it and drank the soup.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They also drank strong tea. Then they be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to wonder whether the men would ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rive that afternoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " The new snow has made the traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard," said Anne Marie. " I think they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">only be here to-morrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they had finally given up hope they</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to sleep, very hungry? especially Pierre</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the dog, since Anne Marie had partaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two hearty meals at the first falls. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next day they finished the little piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiled meat, and then nothing was left but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very small handful of rice and beans</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they found at the bottom of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bags. But it did not matter; the men would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A any moment they might appear around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distant point, and then, how they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat! They watched and watched, and dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly leave the bank where their lookout</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, for fear of missing the first view of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their arrival. Yet the hours were passing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the men did not come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they boiled the few beans and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grains of rice, which made but a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthfuls apiece, and drank more tea. Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the night they watched and listened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but j no one came over the vast expanse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow and ice, and the woods were silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">but for the wind that sighed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, and the masses of snow that occa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sionally fell with a dull sound from the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laden branches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hunger was beginning to feel very pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful. It was a sensation as if something</seg><seg type="columnLine">living was gnawing them, but Anne Marie</seg><seg type="columnLine">had often been hungry before. She said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this feeling would grow, fainter and less</seg><seg type="columnLine">troublesome soon, and then the men would</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive. They chewed pieces of leather from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their tump-lines to give themselves the illu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion that they ,were eating something, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor Paddy whined often, and looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them pitifully. They were very nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">from drinking tea without food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the morning came, they were very</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble, but they began to look down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river before it was really light enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see very far.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pierre placed his hand on Anne Marie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I should have let you go back," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" It was selfish of me to keep you here. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are strong enough, perhaps you had better</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave me now and try to reach the first falls."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am glad," she answered. "I am hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">py to be here with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her devotion touched him deeply. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew by this time how dear he was to her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The love light in her eyes burned more</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly since her return. Their hunger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the cold seemed to put them upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane of equality. There was no longer a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monsieur and ,a poor Montagnais girl, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely two beings who had suffered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he looked at her, he began to worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her thinness and the fact that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">again breathing with some difficulty. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">no fear for himself, yet a chill passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his heart at the thought that, if help</seg><seg type="columnLine">did come, she might die before him. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said she did not suffer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paddy rose restlessly, weak from hunger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from the toil of preceding days, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">begged for food, licking Pierre's hand with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dry tongue. Suddenly his master had</seg><seg type="columnLine">an idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor old Paddy," he said. "You've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to save us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sadly he took the little pistol out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag, and Anne Marie asked him what he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The poor old dog is starving, like us,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.

Over the ice came two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a sledge harnessed to five big nonde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">script mongrels.
