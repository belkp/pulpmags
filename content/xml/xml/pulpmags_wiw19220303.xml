            <seg type="columnLine">It was toward the close of a September day, a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">few years ago, when things were in a wilder</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">state'than at present in that great section of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">has been written about our dashing young hero</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and his friends that it is hardly necessary to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">those who may not have heard of them we will</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">say that Young Wild West, though but a boy in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">vears, was in every other sense a man. He was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">born lighter, and his strict adherence to the right,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and his many hazardous exploits in bringing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wrong-doers to justice, had made for him a name</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that many an older person would have been proud</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to possess. Courage, skill, daring, coolness,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">strength, agility and good judgment were all em-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bodied in the make-up of the boy, and beine</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">handsome, and with the figure of a well-trained</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">athlete, he certainly was a young fellow who was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bound to find a warm placa in the hearts of all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">those who have a fondness for reading of true</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heroism. He invariably wore a fancy hunting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">suit of buckskin, and with his long, light hair</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hanging over his shoulders, he made the true</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">picture of a dashing young Westerner, who knew</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not what fear meant, and who was bound to do</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">what he thought was right, no matter what the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cost. This was especially so when he was mount-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ed on his gallant sorrel stallion, Spitfire, a steed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that had never been beaten in a race, whether it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was for glory or life or death, and which pos-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sessed intelligence and endurance that was not</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">since that time he had held it against all comers.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was not strange, then, that the boy should take</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pride in what he could do; that was only human.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Cheyenne Charlie, the scout and Indian fighter,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Jim Dart, who was a boy about the same age as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the dashing young deadshot, loved him as though</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he were a brother. The girls, who generally</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">traveled with our hero and his two partners, were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Arietta Murdock, the charming golden-haired</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">of Cheyenne Charlie, and Eloise Gardner, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sweetheart of Jim Dart. Though Anna must have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been well past the age of twenty, and married, at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that, she was classed as a girl by them, and they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">always spoke of the three as the "girls " Our</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">friends were finely equipped for camping out on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the mountains and plains. They had with them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">two Chinese servants, who led the pack-horses</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that carried the outfit. These servants were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brothers, named Hop Wah and Wing Wah, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they were typical of their race in looks and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">speech, though one of them was not half as inno-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cent as he looked. This was Hop Wah. The fact</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was that he was far above the average Son of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the Flowery Kingdom in many ways. He was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">really a very clever magician and a born humorist.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Added to these accomplishments, if we may call</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them such, he was a professional gambler, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he liked the cards and dice about as well as he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">liked whisky, which he always spoke of as "tan-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">glefoot." But any bad habits that he may have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had were more than offset by his wonderful clev-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">erness in assisting our hero and his friends in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">times of danger.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Hop was not a fighter, nor could he shoot with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">any degree of accuracy. But more than once had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he saved their lives by his ready wit and sleight-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of-hand. Wing, his brother, had once thought</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">himself something above the ordinary run of his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">race, and he had tried to be a "sport"; but Hop</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was so far ahead of him in this respect that the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">moment he realized it he gave it up and settled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down to be just what he was at the time our</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">story opens, a good cook, who minded his own</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">business and dozed when he had nothing else to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">do. As we have stated, it was tosvard the close</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of a day in September when we find Young Wild</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">West and his friends riding through a desolate</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">canyon. It was one of the parts of Arizona</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">where vegetation is scarce and where bleak-look-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing rocks and sand are plenty. About the onl '</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">living things that were to be seen consisted of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">three or four vultures that were soaring high in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the air, no doubt looking for carrion that might</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lay somewhere among the rocks. Our hero and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">of the column, as they usually did when there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was no known danger threatening. Cheyenne</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Charlie and his wife came next, and behind them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rode Jim Dart and his sweetheart. The two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Chinamen brought up the tail-end of the party,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the pack-horses trotting along after them. They</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were all in hopes of finding a suitable place to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">camp, and according to the young deadshot's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reckoning, there must be a water hole not far</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">away. Wild, as the boy was called by his friends,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had been that way once or twice before, and so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had his two partners. But the girls had never</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">brought out a match, which was one of the kind</seg>
