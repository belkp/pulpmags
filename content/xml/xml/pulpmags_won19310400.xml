            <seg type="columnLine">were outstretched to receive his. He pulled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her toward him. She grasped the stanchion</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and held on. He then dived for a seat,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">tank he ran in perhaps three gallons of the</seg>
