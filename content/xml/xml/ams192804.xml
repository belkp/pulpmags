If a four dimensional forceps could extract </p><p>gall stones from the human body without any op- </p><p>eration, why couldn't it be used for other material </p><p>things—banknotes and jewelry, for instance? The </p><p>far-reaching effects of such a discovery as a four- </p><p>dimensional instrument can hardly be foretold to </p><p>any appreciable degree. The fields in which such </p><p>an instrument might be used arc necessarily many, </p><p>and our author, by this time well known to all our </p><p>readers, has proved himself the possessor of a fer- </p><p>tile mind with a turn for good writing. </p><p>BARON MUENCHHAUSEN’S SCIENTIFIC </p><p>ADVENTURES, by Hugo Gernsback.

Scientists have</p><p> discovered that deep down within you, hidden</p><p> from all the world, even from yourself, lies</p><p> buried a mysterious “other self”—a being of</p><p> whose existence you have never thought—</p><p> and yet who directs the whole destiny of</p><p> vour life, determining your failure or success.</p><p> Since the dawn of history men have</p><p> vaguely realized the existence of this strange,</p><p> dual nature, this baffling</p><p> two-in-Oiie-ness of the hu-</p><p> man mind- And it is this</p><p> subconscious mind, this</p><p> other part of you, which</p><p> is in reality the determin-</p><p> ing factor in the progress</p><p> you make.</p><p> The Veil Drawn From</p><p> Your Other Self</p><p> Do you ever forget to</p><p> do things that you in-</p><p> tended to do?

Y.</p><p>Extravagant Fiction Today...........Cold Fact Tomorrow </p><p>$300.00 PRIZE CONTEST </p><p> Wanted: A Symbol for “Scientifiction”</p><p> By HUGO GERNSBACK</p><p>VER since we had our last prize contest, last </p><p>year, many of our readers have expressed the </p><p>wish to see another contest in this magazine. </p><p>I have given the matter a great deal of </p><p>thought, and I finally came to the following </p><p>_ conclusion: </p><p>coined the word “scientifiction” in 1915, I knew </p><p>that sometime or other it was bound to become popular, and </p><p>1 even cherished a secret hope that some day it might appear </p><p>in a standard dictionary. </p><p> In any event, "scientifiction” is a word that will grow with</p><p>the added years. As science advances, scientifiction will </p><p>advance and flourish. No one of to-day can even dimly fore- </p><p>see what it may produce. There was a time when science </p><p>made scientifiction. The time lias already come when scienti- </p><p>fiction makes science. The author who </p><p>works out a brand new idea in a </p><p>scientifiction plot may be hailed as an </p><p>original inventor years later, when </p><p>his brain-child will have taken wings </p><p>and when cold-blooded scientists will </p><p>have realized the author’s ambition. </p><p> An author may not know how to</p><p>build or make his invention of a cer- </p><p>tain apparatus or instrument, but he </p><p>may know how to predict, and often </p><p>does predict, the use of such a one. </p><p>The professional inventor or scientist </p><p>then comes along, gets the stimulus </p><p>from the story and promptly responds </p><p>with the material invention. It may </p><p>not always work out this way, but it</p><p>is conceivable that it might in the fu- </p><p>ture. The reason is that inventors and scientists, as a rule, </p><p>have their noses close to the grindstone, whereas it takes an </p><p>author with vision to sec ahead and so to start others thinking </p><p>along new lines. The inventor or scientist may not always </p><p>admit the truth of this, but the fact nevertheless remains, </p><p>that both are susceptible to all sorts of outside influences, </p><p>more than they will admit even to themselves. </p><p> The thought occurred to me, therefore, that what scienti-</p><p>fiction needs at present is some sort of a label—an emblem, </p><p>or a trade-mark, so to speak. Scientifiction is too good a </p><p>thing just to be used as a word in mere letters. It should </p><p>have some dignity, and the idea itself of scientifiction should </p><p>have its own crest, henceforth. </p><p> After I had come to this pass, I sat down and composed</p><p>the design that now adorns the front cover of this issue. </p><p>Not being a draftsman or an artist, I explained my idea to </p><p>$300.00 IN PRIZES </p><p>First Prize.........$100.00  </p><p>Second Prize.......  75.00</p><p>Third Prize........  50.00</p><p>Fourth Prize.......  25.00</p><p>Fifth and Sixth Prize,  </p><p>each ............  15.00</p><p>Seventh-Tenth, each  5.00  </p><p>tion is pictured exactly what it is. The big eye represents </p><p>the minds eye. Within that eye, you have, in a pictorial </p><p>presentation, everything that is represented by scientifiction. </p><p>I admit that many of our readers could give the world a </p><p>much better representation of the word “scientifiction,” </p><p>which is what this contest is all about. </p><p> Amazing Stories will pay $300.00 in prizes for the best</p><p>representation of the word “scientifiction."

He was one of those people </p><p>who do everything that is right and proper and sensi- </p><p>ble with inevitable regularity. He always wore just </p><p>the right and proper clothes, steering the narrow </p><p>way between the smart and the shabby, always sub- </p><p>scribed to the right charities, just the judicious com- </p><p>promise between ostentation and meanness, and never </p><p>failed to have his hair cut to exactly the proper </p><p>length. </p><p> Everything that it was right and proper for a</p><p>man in his position to possess, he possessed; and </p><p>everything that it was not right and proper for a </p><p>man in his position to possess, he did not possess. </p><p> And among other right and proper possessions,</p><p>this Mr. Morris had a wife and children. They were </p><p>the right sort of wife, and the right sort and number </p><p>of children, of course; nothing imaginative or highty- </p><p>flighty about any of them, so far as Mr. Morris </p><p>could see; they wore perfectly correct clothing, </p><p>neither smart nor hygienic nor faddy in any way, but </p><p>just sensible; and they lived in a nice sensible house </p><p>in the later Victorian sham </p><p>Queen Anne style of </p><p>architecture, with sham </p><p>half-timbering of choco- </p><p>late-painted plaster in the </p><p>gables, Lincrusta Walton </p><p>sham carved oak panels, a </p><p>terrace of terra cotta to </p><p>imitate stone, and cathe- </p><p>dral glass in the front </p><p>door. His boys went to </p><p>good solid schools, and </p><p>were put to respectable </p><p>professions; his girls, in </p><p>spite of a fantastic protest or so, were all married </p><p>to suitable, steady, oldish young men with good </p><p>prospects. And when it was a fit and proper thing </p><p>for him to do so, Mr. Morris died. His tomb was </p><p>of marble, and, without any art nonsense or lauda-</p><p>tory inscription, quietly imposing—such being the </p><p>fashion of his time. </p><p> He underwent various changes according to the</p><p>accepted customs in these cases, and long before </p><p>this story begins, even his bones had become dust, </p><p>and were scattered to the four quarters of heaven. </p><p>And his sons and his grandsons and his great-grand- </p><p>sons and his great-great-grandsons, they too were </p><p>dust and ashes, and were scattered likewise. It was </p><p>a thing he could not have imagined, that a day would </p><p>come when even his great-great-grandsons would be </p><p>scattered to the four winds of heaven. If any one </p><p>had suggested it to him he would have resented it. </p><p>He was one of those worthy people who take no </p><p>interest in the future of mankind at all. lie had </p><p>grave doubts, indeed, ii there was any future for </p><p>mankind after he was dead. </p><p> It seemed quite impossible and quite uninteresting</p><p>to imagine anything happening after he was dead. </p><p>Yet the thing was so, and when even his great-great- </p><p>grandson was dead and decayed and forgotten, when </p><p>the sham half-timbered house had gone the way of </p><p>all shams, and the Times was extinct, and the silk </p><p>hat a ridiculous antiquity, and the modestly impos- </p><p>ing stone that had been sacred to Mr. Morris had </p><p>been burnt to make lime for mortar, and all that </p><p>Mr. Morris had found real and important was sere </p><p>and dead, the world was still going on, and people </p><p>were still going about it, just as heedless and im- </p><p>patient of the Future, or, indeed, of anything but </p><p>their own selves and property, as Mr. Morris had </p><p>been. </p><p> And, strange to tell, and much as Mr. Morris</p><p>would have been angered if any one had fore- </p><p>shadowed it to him, all over the world there were </p><p>scattered a multitude of people, filled with the breath </p><p>of life, in whose veins the blood of Mr. Morris </p><p>flowed. Just as some day </p><p>the life which is gathered </p><p>now in the reader of this </p><p>very story may also be </p><p>scattered far and wide </p><p>about this world, and min- </p><p>gled with a thousand alien </p><p>strains, beyond all thought </p><p>and tracing. </p><p> And among the descend-</p><p>ants of this Mr. Morris </p><p>was one almost as sensi- </p><p>ble and clear-headed as his </p><p>ancestor. He had just the </p><p>same stout, short frame as that ancient man of the </p><p>nineteenth century, from whom his name of Morris</p><p>—he spelt it Mwres—came; he had the same half- </p><p>contemptuous expression of face. He was a pros-, </p><p>perous person, too, as times went, and he disliked </p><p>the “new-fangled,” and bothers about the future and </p><p>the lower classes, just as much as the ancestral Mor- </p><p>ris had ddne. He did not read the Times: indeed, </p><p>he did not know there ever had been a Times— </p><p>that institution had foundered somewhere in the </p><p>intervening gulf of years; but the phonograph </p><p>HE excel </p><p>man, an&lt; </p><p>Victoria </p><p>ous and </p><p>Times a </p><p> FOU will remember "The Story of the Stone Age," by</p><p> H. G. Wells which we printed a few months ago.</p><p> Here is the counterpart of that story. In the first narra-</p><p> tion, Wells goes back thousands of years ami delves into</p><p> the past ages of man. Now he reaches fonvard to the</p><p> days to come and gives us a most interesting and thought -</p><p> provoking talc that will live for many years in your mem-</p><p> ory. Wells advances a good many original thoughts, even</p><p> in this instalment, and ice werc particularly impressed</p><p> with his idea of hypnosis, which is not at all far-fetched,</p><p> and far more possible than most of us think.</p><p>6 </p><p>i tiininr' </p><p>The middle space was Immovable and gave access by staircases descending Into subterranean ways. Right and left were an ascending </p><p>scries of continuous platforms, each of which traveled about five miles an hour faster than the one internal to it. The establishment of </p><p>the Suranna Hat Syndicate projected n vast facade upon the outer way, sending overhead an overlapping series of huge white glass </p><p>scrcens, on which gigantic animated pictures of the faces of well-known beautiful living women wearing novelties in hats were thrown. </p><p> 7</p><p>8 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>machine that talked to him as he made his toilet </p><p>of a morning, might have been the voice of a rein- </p><p>carnated Blowitz when it dealt with the world’s </p><p>affairs. This phonographic machine was the size </p><p>and shape of a Dutch clock, and down the front </p><p>of it were electric barometric indicators, and an elec- </p><p>tric clock and calendar, and automatic engagement </p><p>reminders, and where the clock would have been </p><p>was the mouth of a trumpet. When it had news, </p><p>the trumpet gobbled like a turkey, “Galloop, galloop,” </p><p>and then brayed out its message as, let us say, a </p><p>trumpet might bray. It would tell Mwres in full, </p><p>rich, throaty tones about the overnight accidents to </p><p>the omnibus flying-machines that plied around the </p><p>world, the latest arrivals at the fashionable resorts </p><p>in Tibet, and of all the great monopolist company </p><p>meetings of the day before, while he was dressing. </p><p>If Mwres did not like hearing what it said, he had </p><p>only to touch a stud, and it would choke a little and </p><p>talk about something else. </p><p> Of course his toilet differed very much from</p><p>that of his ancestor. It is doubtful which would </p><p>have been the more shocked and pained to find him- </p><p>self in the clothing of the other. Mwres would cer- </p><p>tainly have sooner gone forth to the world stark </p><p>naked than in the silk hat, frock coat, grey trousers </p><p>and watch-chain that had filled Mr. Morris with </p><p>sombre self-respect in the past. For Mwres there </p><p>was no shaving to do: a skilful operator had long </p><p>ago removed every hair-root from his face. His </p><p>legs he encased in pleasant pink and amber garments </p><p>of an nir-tight material, which with the help of an </p><p>ingeu-.uts little pump he distended so as to suggest </p><p>enormous muscles. Above this he also wore pneu- </p><p>matic garments beneath an amber silk tunic, so that </p><p>he was clothed in air and admirably protected against </p><p>sudden extremes of heat or cold. Over this he flung </p><p>a scarlet cloak with its edge fantastically curved. On </p><p>his head, which had been skilfully deprived of every </p><p>scrap of hair, he adjusted a pleasant little cap of </p><p>bright scarlet, held on by suction and inflated with </p><p>hydrogen, and curiously like a comb of a cock. So </p><p>his toilet was complete; and, conscious of being </p><p>soberly and becomingly attired, he was ready to face </p><p>his fellow-beings with a tranquil eve. </p><p>THIS Mwres—’the civility of "Mr." had vanished </p><p>ages ago—was one of the officials under the </p><p>Wind Vane and Waterfall Trust, the great company </p><p>that owned every wind wheel and waterfall in the </p><p>world, and which pumped all the water and supplied </p><p>all the electric energy that people in these latter days </p><p>required. He lived in a vast hotel near that part </p><p>of London called Seventh Way, and had very large</p><p>and comfortable apartments on the seventeenth floor. </p><p>Households and family life had long since disap- </p><p>peared with the progressive refinement of manners; </p><p>and indeed the steady rise in rents and land values, </p><p>the disappearance of domestic servants, the elabora- </p><p>tion of cookery, had rendered the separate domicile </p><p>of Victorian times impossible, even had any one de- </p><p>sired such a savage seclusion. When his toilet was </p><p>completed he went towards one of the two doors </p><p>of his apartment—there were doors at opposite </p><p>ends, each marked with a huge arrow pointing one, </p><p>one way and one the other—touched a stud to open </p><p>it, and emerged on a wide passage, the centre of </p><p>which bore chairs and was moving at a steady pace </p><p>to the left. On some of these chairs, gaily-dressed </p><p>men and women were seated. He nodded to an ac- </p><p>quaintance—it was not in those days etiquette to </p><p>talk before breakfast—and seated himself on one </p><p>of these chairs, and in a few seconds he had been </p><p>carried to the doors of a lift, by which he descended </p><p>to the great and splendid hall in which his breakfast </p><p>would be automatically served. </p><p> It was a very different meal from a Victorian</p><p>breakfast. The rude masses of bread needing to be </p><p>carved and smeared over with animal fat before they </p><p>could be made palatable, the still recognisable frag- </p><p>ments of recently killed animals, hideously charred </p><p>and hacked, the eggs torn ruthlessly from beneath </p><p>some protesting hen,—such things as these, though </p><p>they constituted the ordinary fare of Victorian times, </p><p>would have awakened only horror and disgust in the </p><p>refined minds of the people of these latter days. In- </p><p>stead were pastes and cakes of agreeable and varie- </p><p>gated design, without any suggestion in colour or </p><p>form of the unfortunate animals from which their </p><p>substance and juices were derived. They appeared </p><p>on little dishes sliding out upon a rail from a little </p><p>box at one side of the table. The surface of the </p><p>table, to judge by touch and eye, would have appeared </p><p>to a nineteenth-century person to be covered with </p><p>fine white damask, but this was really an oxidised </p><p>metallic surface, and could be cleaned instantly after </p><p>a meal. There were hundreds of such little tables </p><p>in the hall, and at most of them were other latter- </p><p>day citizens singly or in groups. And as Mwres </p><p>seated himself before his elegant repast, the invisible </p><p>orchestra, which had been resting during an interval, </p><p>resumed and filled the air with music. </p><p> But Mwres did not display any great interest,</p><p>either in his breakfast or the music; his eye wan- </p><p>dered incessantly about the hall, as though he ex- </p><p>pected a belated guest. At last he rose eagerly and </p><p>waved his hand, and simultaneously across the hall </p><p>appeared a tall dark figure in a costume of yellow </p><p>and olive green. As this person, walking amidst the</p><p>tables with measured steps, drew near, the pallid </p><p>earnestness of his face and the unusual intensity of </p><p>his eyes became apparent. Mwres reseated himself </p><p>and pointed to a chair beside him. </p><p> “I feared you would never come,” he said. In</p><p>spite of the intervening space of time, the English </p><p>language was still almost exactly the same as it had </p><p>been in England under Victoria the Good. The in- </p><p>vention of the phonograph and such like means of </p><p>recording sound, and the gradual replacement of </p><p>books by such contrivances, had not only saved the </p><p>human eyesight from dccay, but had also by the </p><p>establishment of a sure standard arrested the process </p><p>of change in accent that had hitherto been so in- </p><p>evitable. </p><p> "I was delayed by an interesting case,” said the</p><p>man in green and yellow. ‘‘A prominent politican— </p><p>ahem!—suffering from overwork.” He glanced at </p><p>the breakfast and seated himself. “1 have been </p><p>awake for forty hours.” </p><p> “Eh dear!” said Mwres: "fancy that! You hyp-</p><p>notists have your work to do.” </p><p> The hypnotist helped himself to some attractive</p><p>amber-coloured jelly. “I happen to be a good deal </p><p>in request,” he said modestly. </p><p> “Heaven knows what we should do without you.”</p><p> “Oh! we’re not so indispensable as all that,” said</p><p>the hypnotist, ruminating the flavour of the jelly. </p><p>“The world did very well without us for some thou- </p><p>sands of years. Two hundred years ago even—not </p><p>one! In practice, that is. Physicians by the thou- </p><p>A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME </p><p>9 </p><p>sand, of course—frightfully clumsy brutes for the </p><p>most part, and following one another like sheep— </p><p>but doctors of the mind, except a few empirical </p><p>flounderers, there were none.” </p><p> He concentrated his mind on the jelly.</p><p>tCT) UT were people so sane—” began Mwres. </p><p> X) The hypnotist shook his head. “It didn’t</p><p>matter then if they were a bit silly or faddy. Life </p><p>was so easy-going then. No competition worth </p><p>speaking of—no pressure. A human being had to be </p><p>very lopsided before anything happened. Then, you </p><p>know, they clapped ’em away in what they called a </p><p>lunatic asylum.” </p><p> “I know,” said Mwres. “In these confounded</p><p>historical romances that every one is listening to, </p><p>they always rescue a beautiful girl from an asylum </p><p>or something of the sort. I don't know if you attend </p><p>to that rubbish.” </p><p> “1 must confess I do,” said the hypnotist. “It</p><p>carries one out of one’s self to hear of those quaint, </p><p>adventurous, half-civilized days of the nineteenth </p><p>century, when men were stout and women simple. I </p><p>like a good swaggering story before all things. Curi- </p><p>ous times they were, with their smutty railways and </p><p>puffing old iron trains, their rum little houses and </p><p>their horse vehicles. I suppose you don’t read </p><p>books ?” </p><p> “Dear, no!” said Mwres, “I went to a modern</p><p>school and we had none of that old-fashioned non- </p><p>sense. Phqnographs are good enough for me.” </p><p> "Of course,” said the hypnotist, “of course”; and</p><p>surveyed the table for his next choice. “You know,” </p><p>he said, helping himself to a dark blue confection </p><p>that promised well, “in those days our business was </p><p>scarcely thought of. I daresay if any one had told </p><p>them that in two hundred years’ time a class of men </p><p>would be entirely occupied in impressing things upon </p><p>the memory, effacing unpleasant ideas, controlling </p><p>and overcoming instinctive but undesirable impulses, </p><p>and so forth, by means of hypnotism, they would </p><p>have refused to believe the thing possible. Few peo- </p><p>ple knew that an order made during a mesmeric </p><p>trance, even an order to forget or an order to desire, </p><p>could be given so as to be obeyed after the trance </p><p>was over. Yet there were men alive then who could </p><p>have told them the thing was as absolutely certain </p><p>to come about as—well, the transit of Venus.” </p><p> “They knew of hypnotism, then?”</p><p> “Oh, dear, yes! They used it—for painless den-</p><p>tistry and things like that! This blue stuff is con- </p><p>foundedly good: what is it?” </p><p> “Haven’t the faintest idea,” said Mwres, “but I</p><p>admit it’s very good. Take some more.” </p><p> The hypnotist repeated his praises, and there was</p><p>an appreciative pause. </p><p> “Speaking of these historical romances,” _said</p><p>Mwres, with an attempt at an easy, off-hand man- </p><p>ner, “brings me—ah—to the matter I—ah—had in </p><p>mind when I asked you—when I expressed a wish to </p><p>see you.” He paused and took a deep breath. </p><p> The hypnotist turned an attentive eye upon him,</p><p>and continued eating. </p><p> “The fact is,” said Mwres, “I have a—in fact a—</p><p>daughter. Well, you know I have given her—ah— </p><p>every educational advantage. Lectures—not a soli- </p><p>tary lecturer of ability in the world but she has had </p><p>a telephone direct, dancing, deportment, conversa- </p><p>tion, philosophy, art criticism . . .” He indicated </p><p>catholic culture by a gesture of his hand. “I had in- </p><p>tended her to marry a very good friend of mine— </p><p>Bindon of the Lighting Commission—plain little </p><p>man, you know, and a bit unpleasant in some of his </p><p>ways, but an excellent fellow reallv—an excellent </p><p>fellow.” </p><p> “Yes,” said the hypnotist, “go on. How old is</p><p>she?” </p><p> “Eighteen.”</p><p> “A dangerous age. Well?”</p><p> “Well: it seems that she has been indulging in</p><p>these historical romances—excessively. Excessively. </p><p>Even to the neglect of her philosophy. Filled her </p><p>mind with unutterable nonsense about soldiers who </p><p>fight—what is it?—Etruscans?” </p><p> “Egyptians.”</p><p> “Egyptians—very probably. Hack about with</p><p>swords and revolvers and things—blood-shed galore </p><p>—horrible!—and about young men on torpedo </p><p>catchers who blow up—Spaniards, I fancy—and all </p><p>sorts of irregular adventurers. And she has got it </p><p>into her head that she must marry for Love, and </p><p>that poor little Bindon—” </p><p> “I've met similar cases,” said the hypnotist. “Who</p><p>is the other young man?” </p><p> Mwres maintained an appearance of resigned calm.</p><p>“You may well ask,” he said. ‘"He is”—and his </p><p>voice sank with shame—“a mere attendant upon the </p><p>stage on which the flying-machines from Paris alight. </p><p>He has—as they say in the romances—good looks. </p><p>He is quite young and very eccentric. Affects the an- </p><p>tique—he can read and write! So can she. And </p><p>instead of communicating by telephone, like sensible </p><p>people, they write and deliver—what is it?” </p><p> “Notes?”</p><p> “No—not notes. . . . Ah—poems.”</p><p> The hypnotist raised his eyebrows. “How did she</p><p>meet him ?” </p><p> “Tripped coming down from the flying-machine</p><p>from Paris—and fell into his arms. The mischief </p><p>was done in a moment!” </p><p> “Yes?”</p><p> “Well—that’s all. Things must be stopped. That</p><p>is what I want to consult you about. What must be </p><p>done? What can be done? Of course I’m not a </p><p>hypnotist; my knowledge is limited. But you—?” </p><p>“Hypnotism is not magic,” said the man in green, </p><p>putting both arms on the table. </p><p> “Oh, precisely! But still—!”</p><p> “People cannot be hypnotised without their con-</p><p>sent. If she is able to stand out against marrying </p><p>Bindon, she will probably stand out against being </p><p>hypnotised. ‘But if once she can be hypnotised—even </p><p>by somebody else—the thing is done.” </p><p> “You can—?”</p><p> “Oh, certainly! Once we get her amenable, then</p><p>we can suggest that she must marry Bindon—that </p><p>that is her fate; or that the young man is repulsive, </p><p>and that when she sees him she will be giddy and </p><p>faint, or any little thing of that sort. Or if we,can </p><p>get her into a sufficiently profound trance we can- </p><p>suggest that she should forget him altogether—” </p><p>“Precisely.” </p><p> “But the problem is to get her hypnotised. Of</p><p>course no sort of proposal or suggestion must come </p><p>from you—because no doubt she already distrusts </p><p>you in the matter.” </p><p> The hypnotist leant his head upon his arm and</p><p>thought. </p><p>10 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>tfTT’S hard a man cannot dispose of his own </p><p> JL daughter,” said Mwres irrelevantly.</p><p> “You must give me the name and address of the</p><p>young lady,” said the hypnotist, “and any informa- </p><p>tion bearing upon the matter. And, by the bye, is </p><p>there any money in the affair ?” </p><p> Mwres hesitated.</p><p> “There’s a sum—in fact, a considerable sum—in-</p><p>vested in the Patent Road Company. From her </p><p>mother. That's what makes the thing so exasperat- </p><p>ing.” </p><p> “Exactly,” said the hypnotist. And he proceeded</p><p>to cross-examine Mwres on the entire affair. </p><p> It was a lengthy interview.</p><p> And meanwhile “Elizebeth Mwres,” as she spelt</p><p>her name, or “Elizabeth Morris” as a nineteenth-cen- </p><p>tury person would have put it, was sitting in a quiet </p><p>waiting-place beneath the great stage upon which </p><p>the flying-machine from Paris descended. And be- </p><p>side her sat her slender, handsome lover reading her </p><p>the poem he bad written that morning while on duty </p><p>upon the stage. When he had finished, they sat for </p><p>a time in silence; and then, as if for their special en- </p><p>tertainment, the great machine that had come flying </p><p>through the air from America that morning rushed </p><p>down out of the sky. </p><p> At first it was a little oblong; faint and blue amidst</p><p>the distant fleecy clouds; and then it grew swiftly </p><p>large and white, and larger and whiter, until they </p><p>could see the separate tiers of sails, each hundreds of </p><p>feet wide, and the lank body they supported, and at </p><p>last even the swinging seats of the passengers in a </p><p>dotted row. Although it was falling, it seemed to </p><p>them to be rushing up the sky, and, over the roof- </p><p>spaces of the city below, its shadow leapt towards </p><p>them. They heard the whistling rush of the air </p><p>about it and its yelling siren, shrill and swelling, to </p><p>warn those who were on its landing-stage of its ar- </p><p>rival. And abruptly the note fell down a couple of </p><p>octaves, and it had passed, and the sky was clear </p><p>and void, and she could turn her sweet eyes again </p><p>to Denton at her side. </p><p> Their silcnce ended; and Denton, speaking in a</p><p>little language of broken English that was, they </p><p>fancied, their private possession—though lovers have </p><p>used such little languages since the world began—</p><p>told her how they too would leap into the air one </p><p>morning out of all the obstacles and difficulties about </p><p>them, and fly to a sunlit city of delight he knew of </p><p>in Japan, half-way about the world. </p><p> She loved the dream, but she feared the leap; and</p><p>she put him off with “Some day, dearest one, some </p><p>day,” to all his pleading that it might be soon; and </p><p>at last came a shrilling of whistles, and it was time </p><p>for him to go back to his duties on the stage. They </p><p>parted—as lovers have been wont to part for thou- </p><p>sands of years. She walked down a passage to a </p><p>lift, and so came to one of the streets of that latter- </p><p>day London, all glazed in with glass, from the </p><p>weather, and with incessant moving platforms that </p><p>went to all parts of the city. And by one of these </p><p>she returned to her apartments in the Hotel for </p><p>Women where she lived, the apartments that were </p><p>in telephonic communication with all the best lec- </p><p>turers in the world. But the sunlight of the flying </p><p>stage was in her heart, and the wisdom of all the </p><p>best lecturers in the world seemed folly in that light. </p><p> She spent the middle part of the day in the gym-</p><p>nasium, and took her midday meal with two other </p><p>girls and their common chaperone—for it was still </p><p>the custom to have a chaperone in the case of mother- </p><p>less girls of the more prosperous classes. The chap- </p><p>erone had a visitor that day, a man in green and </p><p>yellow, with a white face and vivid eyes, who talked </p><p>amazingly. Among other things, he fell to praising </p><p>a new historical romance that one of the great pop- </p><p>ular story-tellers of the day had just put forth. It </p><p>was, of course, about the spacious times of Queen </p><p>Victoria; and the author, among other pleasing novel- </p><p>ties, made a little argument before each section of </p><p>the story, in imitation of the chapter headings of the </p><p>old-fashioned books; as for example, “How the Cab- </p><p>men of Pimlico stopped the Victoria Omnibuses, and </p><p>of the Great Fight in Palace Yard,” and “How the </p><p>Piccadilly Policeman was Slain in the Midst of his </p><p>Duty.” The man in green and yellow praised this </p><p>innovation. “These pithy sentences,” he said, “are </p><p>admirable. They show at a glance those headlong, </p><p>tumultuous times, when men and animals jostled in </p><p>the filthy streets, and death might wait for one at </p><p>every corner. Life was life then! How great the </p><p>world must have seemed then! How marvellous! </p><p>There were still parts of the world absolutely unex- </p><p>plored. Nowadays we have almost abolished won- </p><p>der ; we lead lives so trim and orderly that courage, </p><p>endurance, faith, all the noble virtues seem fading </p><p>from mankind.” </p><p> And so on, taking the girls’ thoughts with him,</p><p>until the life they led, life in the vast and intricate </p><p>London of the twenty-second century, a life inter-</p><p>spersed with soaring excursions to every part of the </p><p>globe, seemed to them a monotonous misery com- </p><p>pared with the daedal past. </p><p> At first Elizabeth did not join in the conversa-</p><p>tion, but after a time the subject became so inter- </p><p>esting that she made a few shy interpolations. But </p><p>he scarcely seemed to notice her as he talked. He </p><p>went on to describe a new method of entertaining </p><p>people. They were hypnotised, 'and then suggestions </p><p>were made to them so skilfully that they seemed to </p><p>be living in ancient times again. They played out </p><p>a little romance in the past as vivid as reality, and </p><p>when at last they awakened, they remembered all </p><p>they had been through as though it were a real </p><p>thing. </p><p> ‘‘It is a thing we have sought to do for years and</p><p>years,” said the hypnotist. “It is practically an arti- </p><p>ficial dream. And we know the way at last. Think </p><p>of all it opens out to us—the enrichment of our ex- </p><p>perience, the recovery of adventure, the refuge it </p><p>offers from this sordid, competitive life in which </p><p>we live! Think!” </p><p> “And you can do that!” said the chaperone eagerly.</p><p>“The thing is possible at last,” the hypnotist said. </p><p>“You may order a dream as you wish.” </p><p> The chaperone was the first to be hypnotised, and</p><p>the dream, she said, was wonderful, when she came </p><p>to again. </p><p> The other two girls, encouraged by her enthusiasm</p><p>also placed themselves in the hands of the hypnotist </p><p>and had plunges into the romantic past. No one sug- </p><p>gested that Elizabeth should try this novel entertain- </p><p>ment ; it was at her own request at last that she was </p><p>taken into that land of dreams where there is neither </p><p>any freedom of choice nor will. . . . </p><p> And so the mischief was done.</p><p>ONE day, when Denton went down to that quiet </p><p>seat beneath the flying stage, Elizabeth was not </p><p>in her wonted place. He was disappointed, and a </p><p>A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME </p><p>11 </p><p>little angry. The next day she did not come, and the </p><p>next also. He was afraid. To hide his fear from </p><p>himself, he set to work to write sonnets for her when </p><p>she should come again . . . </p><p> For three days he fought against his dread by</p><p>such distraction, and then the truth was before him </p><p>clear and cold, and would not be denied. She might </p><p>be ill, she might be dead; but he would not believe </p><p>that be had been betrayed. There followed a week </p><p>of misery. And then he knew she was the only thing </p><p>on earth worth having, and that he must seek her, </p><p>however hopeless the search, until she was found </p><p>once more. </p><p> He had some small private means of his own, and</p><p>so he threw'over his appointment on the flying stage, </p><p>and set himself to find this girl, who had become </p><p>at last all the world to him. lie did not know where </p><p>she lived, and little of her circumstances; for it had </p><p>been part of the delight of her girlish romance that </p><p>he should know nothing of her, nothing of the dif- </p><p>ference of their station. The ways of the city </p><p>opened before him east and west, north and south. </p><p>Even in Victorian days London was a maze, that little </p><p>London with its poor four millions of people; but the </p><p>London he explored, the London of the twenty- </p><p>second century, was a London of thirty million souls. </p><p>At first he was energetic and headlong, taking time </p><p>neither to eat nor sleep. He sought for weeks and </p><p>months, he went through every imaginable phase of </p><p>fatigue and despair, over-excitement and anger. </p><p>Long after hope was dead, by the sheer inertia of </p><p>his desire, he still went to and fro, peering into faces </p><p>and looking this way and that, in the incessant ways </p><p>and lilts and passages of that interminable hive </p><p>of men. </p><p> At last chance was kind to him, and he saw her.</p><p> It was in a time of festivity. He was hungry; he</p><p>had paid the inclusive fee and had gone into one of </p><p>the gigantic dining-places of the city; he was pushing </p><p>his way among the tables and scrutinising by mere </p><p>force of habit every group he passed. </p><p> ile stood still, robbed of all power of motion, his</p><p>eyes wide, his lips apart. Elizabeth sat scarcely </p><p>twenty yards away from him, looking straight at </p><p>him. Her eyes were as hard to him, as hard and </p><p>expressionless and void of recognition, as the eyes </p><p>of a statue. </p><p> She looked at him for a moment, and then her</p><p>gaze passed beyond him.</p><p> Had he had only her eyes to judge by he might</p><p>have doubted if it were indeed Elizabeth, but he knew </p><p>her by the gesture of her hand, by the grace of a </p><p>wanton little curl that floated over her ear as she </p><p>moved her head. Something was said to her, and </p><p>she turned smiling tolerantly to the man beside her, </p><p>a little man in foolish raiment knobbed and spiked </p><p>like some odd reptile with pneumatic horns—the </p><p>Bindon of her father’s choice. </p><p> For a moment Denton stood white and wild-eyed;</p><p>then came a terrible faintness, and he sat before one </p><p>of the little tables. He sat down with his back to </p><p>her, and for a time be did not dare to look at her </p><p>again. When at last he did, she and Bindon and two </p><p>other people were standing up to go. The others </p><p>were her father and her chaperone. </p><p> He sat as if incapable of action until the four</p><p>figures were remote and small, and then he rose, </p><p>possessed with the one idea of pursuit. For a space </p><p>he feared he had lost them, and then he came upon </p><p>Elizabeth and her chaperone again in one of the </p><p>streets of moving platforms that intersected the city. </p><p>Bindon and Mwres had disappeared. </p><p> He could not control himself to patience. He</p><p>felt he must speak to her forthwith, or die. He </p><p>pushed forward to where they were seated, and sat </p><p>down beside them. His white face was convulsed </p><p>with half-hysterical excitement. </p><p> lie laid his hand on her wrist. “Elizabeth?” he</p><p>said. </p><p> She turned in unfeigned astonishment. Nothing</p><p>but the fear of a strange man showed in her face. </p><p> ‘‘Elizabeth,” he cried, and his voice was strange</p><p>to him: “dearest—you know me?” </p><p> Elizabeth's face showed nothing but alarm and</p><p>perplexity. She drew herself away from him. The </p><p>chaperone, a little grey-headed woman with mobile </p><p>features, leant forward to intervene. Her resolute </p><p>bright eyes examined Denton. “What do you say?” </p><p>she asked. </p><p> “This young lady,” said Denton—“she knows me.”</p><p> “Do you know him, dear?”</p><p> “No,” said Elizabeth in a strange voice, and with</p><p>a hand to her forehead, speaking almost as one who </p><p>repeats a lesson. “No, I do not know him. I know </p><p>—I do not know him.” </p><p> “But—but. . . . Not know me! It is I—Denton.</p><p>Denton! To whom you used to talk. Don't you re- </p><p>member the flying stages? The little seat in the open </p><p>air? The verses—” </p><p> “No,” cried Elizabeth,—“no. I do not know him.</p><p>I do not know him. There is something. . . . But I </p><p>don't know. All I know is that I do not know him.” </p><p>Her face was a face of infinite distress. </p><p> The sharp eyes of the chaperone flitted to and</p><p>fro from the girl to the man. “You see?” she said, </p><p>with the faint shadow of a smile. “She does not </p><p>know you.” </p><p> “I do not know you,” said Elizabeth. “Of that I</p><p>am sure.” </p><p> “But, dear—the songs—the little verses—”</p><p> “She does not know you,” said the chaperone.</p><p>“You must not. . . . You have made a mistake. </p><p>You must not go on talking to us after that. You </p><p>must not annoy us on the public ways.” </p><p> “But—” said Denton, and for a moment his miser-</p><p>ably haggard face appealed against fate. </p><p> “You must not persist, young man,” protested</p><p>the chaperone. </p><p> “Elizabeth!” he cried.</p><p> Her face was the face of one who is tormented.</p><p>“I do not know you,” she cried, hand to brow. “Oh, </p><p>I do not know you!”, </p><p> For an instant Denton sat stunned. Then be stood</p><p>up and groaned aloud. </p><p> He made? a strange gesture of appeal towards the</p><p>remote glass roof of the public way, then turned and </p><p>went plunging recklessly from one moving platform </p><p>to another’ and vanished amidst the swarms of peo- </p><p>ple going to and fro thereon. The chapcrone’s eyes </p><p>followed him, and then she looked at the curious </p><p>faces about her. </p><p> “Dear,” asked Elizabeth, clasping her hand, and</p><p>too deeply moved to heed observation, “who was that </p><p>man ? Who was that man ?” </p><p> The chaperone raised her eyebrows. She spoke</p><p>in a clear, audible voice. “Some half-witted creature. </p><p>I have never set eyes on him before.” </p><p> “Never?”</p><p> “Never, dear. Do not trouble your mind about a</p><p>thing like this.” </p><p>12 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>y\ND soon after this the celebrated hypnotist who </p><p>dressed in green and yellow had another client, </p><p>l he young man paced his consulting-room. pale and </p><p>disordered. “I want to forget,” he cried. “I must </p><p>forget." </p><p> The hypnotist watched him with quiet eyes, studied</p><p>his face and clothes and bearing. ‘‘To forget any- </p><p>thing—pleasure or pain—is to be, by so much—less. </p><p>However, you know your own concern. My fee is </p><p>high." </p><p> “If only I can forget—’’</p><p> “That's easy enough with you. You wish it. I’ve</p><p>done much harder things. Quite recently. 1 hardly </p><p>expected to do it; the thing was done against the will </p><p>of the hypnotised person. A love affair too—like </p><p>yours. A girl. So rest assured." </p><p> The young man came and sat beside the hypnotist.</p><p>His manner was a forced calm. Me looked into the </p><p>hypnotist’s eyes. “I will tell you. Of course you </p><p>will want to know what it is. There was a girl. </p><p>Her name was Elizabeth Mwres. Well. . . .” </p><p> He stopped. He had seen the instant surprise on</p><p>the hypnotist’s face. In that instant he knew. He </p><p>stood up. He seemed to dominate the seated figure </p><p>by his side. He gripped the shoulder of green and </p><p>gold. For a time he could not find words. </p><p> "Give her vie back!” he said at last. “Give her</p><p>me back!” </p><p> “What do you mean?” gasped the hypnotist.</p><p> “Give her me back.”</p><p> “Give whom?”</p><p> “Elizabeth Mwres—the girl—”</p><p> The hypnotist tried to free himself; he rose to his</p><p>feet. Denton’s grip tightened. </p><p> “Let go!" cried the hypnotist, thrusting an arm</p><p>against Denton’s chest. </p><p> In a moment the two men were locked in a clumsy</p><p>wrestle. Neither had the slightest training—for </p><p>athleticism, except for exhibition and to afford op- </p><p>portunity for betting, had faded out of the earth— </p><p>but Denton was not only the younger but the stronger </p><p>of the two. They swayed across the room, and then</p><p>the hypnotist had gone down under his antagonist. </p><p>They fell together. . . . </p><p> Denton leaped to his feet, dismayed at his own</p><p>fury; but the hypnotist lay still, and suddenly from </p><p>a little white mark where his forehead had struck </p><p>a stool shot a hurrying band of red. For a space </p><p>Denton stood over him irresolute, trembling. </p><p> A fear of the consequences entered his gently nur-</p><p>tured mind. He turned towards the door. “No,” </p><p>he said aloud, and came back to the middle of the </p><p>room. Overcoming the instinctive repugnance of </p><p>one who had seen no act of violence in all his life </p><p>before, he knelt down beside his antagonist and felt </p><p>his heart. Then he peered at the wound. He rose </p><p>quietly and looked about him. He began to see </p><p>more of the situation. </p><p> When presently the hypnotist recovered his senses,</p><p>his head ached severely, his back was against Den- </p><p>ton’s knees and Denton was sponging his face. </p><p> The hypnotist did not speak. But presently he in-</p><p>dicated by a gesture that in his opinion he had been </p><p>sponged enough. “Let me get up,” he said. </p><p> “Not yet,” said Denton.</p><p> “You have assaulted me. you scoundrel!”</p><p> “We are alone,” said Denton, “and the door is</p><p>secure.” </p><p> There was an interval of thought.</p><p> “Unless I sponge,” said Denton, “your forehead</p><p> will develop a tremendous bruise.”</p><p> “You can go on sponging,” said the hypnotist</p><p> sulkily.</p><p> There was another pause.</p><p> “\\ e might be in the Stone Age.” said the hyp-</p><p> notist. “Violence! Struggle!"</p><p> “In the Stone Age no man dared to come between</p><p> man and woman,” said Denton.</p><p> The hypnotist thought again.</p><p> “What are you going to do?" he asked.</p><p> “While you were insensible I found the girl’s ad-</p><p> dress on your tablets. I did not know it before. I</p><p> telephoned. She will be here soon. Then—”</p><p> “She will bring her chaperone."</p><p> “That is all right.”</p><p> “But what—? I don’t see. What do you mean</p><p> to do?”</p><p> “I looked about for a weapon also. It is an as-</p><p> tonishing thing how few weapons there are nowa-</p><p> days. If you consider that in the Stone Age men</p><p> owned scarcely anything but weapons. I hit at last</p><p> upon this lamp. I have wrenched off the wires and</p><p> tilings, and I hold it so." He extended it over the</p><p> hypnotist’s shoulders. “With that I can quite easily</p><p> smash your skull. I mil—unless you do as I tell</p><p> you.”</p><p> “Violence is no remedy,” said the hypnotist, quot-</p><p> ing from the “Modern Man’s Book of Moral</p><p> Maxims.”</p><p> “It’s an undesirable disease,” said Denton.</p><p> “Well?”</p><p> “You will tell that chaperone you are going to</p><p> order the girl to marry that knobby little brute with</p><p> the red hair and ferrety eyes. I believe that's how</p><p> things stand ?”</p><p> “Yes—that’s how things stand.”</p><p> “And, pretending to do that, you will restore her</p><p> memory of me."</p><p> “It’s unprofessional.”</p><p> “Look here! If 1 cannot have that girl I would</p><p> rather die than not. I don't propose to respect your</p><p> little fancies. If anything goes wrong you shall not</p><p> live five minutes. This is a rude makeshift of a</p><p> weapon, and it may quite conceivably be painful to</p><p> kill you. But I will. It is unusual, I know, nowa-</p><p> days to do things like this—mainly because there is</p><p> so little in life that is worth being violent about.”</p><p> “The chaperone will see you directly she comes—”</p><p> “I shall stand in that recess. Behind you.”</p><p> The hypnotist thought. “You are a determined</p><p> young man,” he said, “and only half civilized. I</p><p> have tried to do my duty to my client, but in this</p><p> affair you seem likely to get your own way. . . .”</p><p> “You mean to deal straightly.”</p><p> “I’m not going to risk having my brains scattered</p><p> in a petty affair like this.”</p><p> “And afterwards?”</p><p> “There is nothing a hypnotist or doctor hates so</p><p> much as a scandal. I at least am no savage. I am</p><p> annoyed. ... But in a day or so I shall bear no</p><p> malice. . . .”</p><p> “Thank you. And now that we understand each</p><p> other, there is no necessity to keep you sitting any</p><p> longer on the floor.”</p><p>A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME </p><p>13 </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>The Vacant Country </p><p>THE world, they say, changed more between </p><p>the year 1800 and the year 1900 than it had </p><p>done in the previous five hundred years. That </p><p>century, the nineteenth century, was the dawn of a </p><p>new epoch in the history of mankind—the epoch of </p><p>the great cities, the end of the old order of country </p><p>life. </p><p> In the beginning of the nineteenth. century the</p><p>majority of mankind still lived upon the countryside, </p><p>as their way of life had been for countless genera- </p><p>tions. All over the world they dwelt in little towns </p><p>and villages then, and engaged either directly in </p><p>agriculture, or in occupations that were of service to </p><p>the agriculturist. They travelled rarely, and dwelt </p><p>close to their work, because swift means of transit </p><p>had not yet come. The few who travelled went </p><p>either on foot, or in slow sailing-ships, or by means </p><p>of jogging horses incapable of more than sixty miles </p><p>a day. Think of it!—sixty miles a day. Here and </p><p>th^re, in those sluggish times, a town grew a little </p><p>larger than its neighbors, as a port or as a centre of </p><p>government; but all the towns in the world with </p><p>more than a hundred thousand inhabitants could be </p><p>counted on a man’s fingers. So it was in the begin- </p><p>ning of the nineteenth century. By the end, the in- </p><p>vention of railways, telegraphs, steamships, and com- </p><p>plex agricultural machinery, had changed all these </p><p>things; changed them beyond all hope of return. </p><p>The vast shops, the varied pleasures, the countless </p><p>conveniences of the larger towns were suddenly </p><p>possible, and no sooner existed than they were </p><p>brought into competition with the homely resources </p><p>of the rural centres. Mankind were drawn to the </p><p>cities by an overwhelming attraction. The demand </p><p>for labour fell with the increase of machinery, the </p><p>local markets were entirely superseded, and there </p><p>was a rapid growth of the larger centres at the ex- </p><p>pense of the open country. </p><p> The flow of population townward was the con-</p><p>stant preoccupation of Victorian writers. In Great </p><p>Britain and New England, in India and China, the </p><p>same thing was remarked; everywhere a few swol- </p><p>len towns were visibly replacing the ancient order. </p><p>That this was an inevitable result of improved means </p><p>of travel and transport—that, given swift means of </p><p>transit, these things must be—was realized by few; </p><p>and the most puerile schemes were devised to over- </p><p>come the mysterious magnetism of the urban centres, </p><p>and keep the people on the land. </p><p> Yet the develQpments of the nineteenth century</p><p>were only the dawning of the new order. The first </p><p>great cities of the new time were horribly incon- </p><p>venient, darkened by smoky fogs, insanitary and </p><p>noisy; but the discovery of new methods of building, </p><p>new methods of heating, changed all this. Between </p><p>1900 and 2000 the march of change was still more </p><p>rapid; and between 2000 and 2100 the continually </p><p>accelerated progress of human invention made the </p><p>reign of Victoria the Good seem at last an almost </p><p>incredible vision of idyllic tranquil days. </p><p> The introduction of railways was only the first</p><p>step in that development of those means of locomo- </p><p>tion which finally revolutionized human life. By the </p><p>year 2000 railways and roads had vanished together. </p><p>The railways, robbed of their..rails, had become </p><p>weedy ridges and ditches upon the face of the world; </p><p>the old roads, strange barbaric tracks of flint and </p><p>soil, hammered by hand or rolled by rough iron roll- </p><p>ers, strewn with miscellaneous filth, and cut by iron </p><p>hoofs and wheels into ruts and puddles often many </p><p>inches deep, had been replaced by patent tracks made </p><p>of a substance called Eadhamite. This Eadhamite— </p><p>it was named after its patentee—ranks with the in- </p><p>vention of printing and steam as one of the epoch- </p><p>making discoveries of the world’s history. </p><p> When Eadham discovered the substa xe, he prob-</p><p>ably thought of it as a mere cheap substitute for </p><p>India rubber; it cost a few shillings a ton. But you </p><p>can never tell all an invention will do. It was the </p><p>genius of a man named Warming that pointed to the </p><p>possibility of using it, not only for the tires of </p><p>wheels, but as a road substance; it was he who </p><p>organized the enormous network of public ways that </p><p>speedily covered the world. </p><p> These public ways were made with longitudinal</p><p>divisions. On the outer on either side went foot </p><p>cyclists and conveyances traveling at a less speed </p><p>than twenty-five miles an hour; in the middle, mo- </p><p>tors capable of speed up to a hundred; and the inner, </p><p>Warming (in the face of enormous ridicule) re- </p><p>served for vehicles travelling at speeds of a hundred </p><p>miles an hour and upward. </p><p> For ten years his inner ways were vacant. Be-</p><p>fore he died they were the most crowded of all, and </p><p>vast light frameworks with wheels of twenty and </p><p>thirty feet in diameter, hurled along them at paces </p><p>that year after year rose steadily towards two hun- </p><p>dred miles an hour. And by the time this revolution </p><p>was accomplished, a parallel revolution had trans- </p><p>formed the ever-growing cities. Before the devel- </p><p>opment of practical science the fogs and filth of </p><p>Victorian times vanished. Electric heating replaced</p><p>fires (in 2013 the lighting of a fire that did not ab- </p><p>solutely consume its own smoke was made an in- </p><p>dictable nuisance), and all the city ways, all public </p><p>squares and places, were covered in with a recently </p><p>invented glass-like substance. The rooting of Lon- </p><p>don became practically continuous. Certain short- </p><p>sighted and foolish legislation against tall buildings </p><p>was abolished, and London, from a squat expanse </p><p>of petty houses—feebly archaic in design—rose </p><p>steadily towards the sky. To the municipal respon- </p><p>sibility for water, light, and drainage, was added </p><p>another, and that was ventilation. </p><p>BUT to tell of all the changes in human con- </p><p>venience that these two hundred years brought </p><p>about, to tell of the long foreseen invention of flying, </p><p>to describe how life in households was steadily sup- </p><p>planted by life in interminable hotels, how at last </p><p>even those who were still concerned in agricultural </p><p>work came to live in the towns and to go to and fro </p><p>to their work every day, to describe how at last in </p><p>all England only four towns remained, each with </p><p>many millions of people, and how there were left </p><p>no inhabited houses in all the countryside; to tell all </p><p>this would take us far from our story of Denton </p><p>and his Elizabeth. They had been separated and re- </p><p>united, and still they could not marry. For Denton </p><p>■—it was his only fault—had no money. Neither had </p><p>Elizabeth until she was twenty-one, and as yet she </p><p>was only eighteen. At twenty-one, all the property </p><p>of her mother would come to her, for that was the </p><p>custom of the time. She did not know that it was </p><p>possible to anticipate her fortune, and Denton was </p><p>.far too delicate a lover to suggest such a thing. So </p><p>14 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>things stuck hopelessly between them. Elizabeth </p><p>said that she was very unhappy, and that nobody un- </p><p>derstood her but Denton, and that when she was </p><p>away from him she was wretched; and Denton said </p><p>that his heart longed for her day and night. And </p><p>they met as often as they could to enjoy the discus- </p><p>sion of their sorrows. </p><p> They met one day at their little seat upon the</p><p>flying stage. The precise site of this meeting was </p><p>where in Victorian times the road from Wimbledon </p><p>came out upon the common. They were, however, </p><p>five hundred feet above that point. Their seat looked </p><p>far over London. To convey the appearance of it </p><p>all to a nineteenth-century reader would have been </p><p>difficult. One would have had to tell him to think </p><p>of the Crystal Palace, of the newly built “mammoth” </p><p>hotels—as those little affairs were called—of the </p><p>larger railway stations of his time, and to imagine </p><p>such buildings enlarged to vast proportions and run </p><p>together and continuous over the whole metropolitan </p><p>area. If then he was told that this continuous roof- </p><p>space bore a huge forest of rotating wind-wheels, he </p><p>would have begun very dimly to appreciate what to </p><p>these young people was the commonest sight in their </p><p>lives. </p><p> To their eyes it had something of the quality of a</p><p>prison, and they were talking, as they had talked a </p><p>hundred times before, of how they might escape </p><p>from it and be at last happy together: escape from it, </p><p>that is, before the appointed three years were at an </p><p>end. It was, they both agreed, not only impossible </p><p>but almost wicked, to wait three years. “Before that,” </p><p>said Denton—and the notes of his voice told of a </p><p>splendid chest—"we might both be dead!” </p><p> Their vigorous young hands had to grip at this,</p><p>and then Elizabeth had a still more poignant thought </p><p>that brought the tears from her wholesome eyes and </p><p>down her healthy cheeks. “One of us,” she said, </p><p>“one of us might be—” </p><p> She choked; she could not say the word that is so</p><p>terrible to the young and happy. </p><p> Yet to marry and be very poor in the cities of that</p><p>time was—for any one who had lived pleasantly—a </p><p>very dreadful thing. In the old agricultural days </p><p>that had drawn to an end in the eighteenth century </p><p>there had been a pretty proverb of love in a cottage; </p><p>and indeed in those days the poor of the countryside </p><p>had dwelt in flower-covered, diamond-windowed cot- </p><p>tages of thatch and plaster, with the sweet air and </p><p>.earth about them, amidst tangled hedges and the song</p><p>of birds, and with the ever-changing sky overhead. </p><p>But all this had changed (the change was already be- </p><p>ginning in the nineteenth century), and a new sort </p><p>of life was opening for the poor—in the lower quar- </p><p>ters of the city. </p><p> In the nineteenth century the lower quarters were</p><p>still beneath the sky; they were areas of land on </p><p>clay or other unsuitable soil, liable to floods or ex- </p><p>posed to the smoke of more fortunate districts, in- </p><p>sufficiently supplied with water, and as insanitary </p><p>as the great fear of infectious diseases felt by the </p><p>wealthier classes permitted. In the twenty-second </p><p>century, however, the growth of the city story above </p><p>story, and the coalescence of buildings, had led to a </p><p>different arrangement. The prosperous people lived </p><p>in a vast series of sumptuous hotels in the upper </p><p>storeys and halls of the city fabric; the industrial </p><p>population dwelt beneath in the tremendous ground- </p><p>floor and basement, so to speak, of the place. </p><p>IN the refinement of life and manners these lower </p><p>classes differed little from their ancestors, the </p><p>East-enders of Queen Victoria’s time; but they had </p><p>developed a distinct dialect of their own. In these </p><p>under ways they lived and died, rarely ascending to </p><p>the surface except when work took them there. </p><p>Since for most of them this was the sort of life to </p><p>which they had been born, they found no great </p><p>misery in such circumstances; but for people like </p><p>Denton and Elizabeth, such a plunge would have </p><p>seemed more terrible than death. </p><p>“And yet what else is there?” asked Elizabeth. </p><p>Denton professed not to know. Apart from his </p><p>own feeling of delicacy, he was not sure how Eliza- </p><p>beth would like the idea of borrowing on the strength </p><p>of her expectations. </p><p> The passage from London to Pans even, said</p><p>Elizabeth, was beyond their means; and in Paris, as </p><p>in any other city in the world, life would be just as </p><p>costly and impossible as in London. </p><p> Well might Denton cry aloud: “If only we had</p><p>lived in those days, dearest! If only we had lived </p><p>in the past!" For to their eyes even nineteenth-cen- </p><p>tury Whitechapel was seen through a mist of </p><p>romance. </p><p> “Is there nothing?” cried Elizabeth, suddenly</p><p>weeping. “Must we really wait for those three long </p><p>years? Fancy three years—six-and-thirty months.” </p><p>The human capacity for patience had not grown with </p><p>the ages. </p><p> Then suddenly Denton was moved to speak of</p><p>something that had already flickered across his mind.</p><p>He had hit upon it at last. It seemed to him so wild </p><p>a suggestion that he made it only half seriously. But </p><p>to put a thing into words has ever a way of making </p><p>it seem more real and possible than it seemed before. </p><p>And so it was with him. </p><p> “Suppose," he said, “we went into the country?”</p><p>She looked at him to see if he was serious in </p><p>proposing such an adventure. </p><p> “The country?”</p><p> “Yes—beyond there. Beyond the hills.”</p><p> “How could we live?” she said. “Where could</p><p>we live?” </p><p> “It is not impossible,” he said. “People used to</p><p>live in the country,” </p><p> “But then there were houses.”</p><p> “There are the ruins of villages and towns now.</p><p>On the clay lands they are gone, of course. But </p><p>they are still left on the grazing land, because it does </p><p>not pay the Food Company to remove them. I </p><p>know that—for certain. Besides, one sees them </p><p>from the flying machines, you know. Well, we </p><p>might shelter in some one of these, and repair it with </p><p>our hands. Do you know, the thing is not so wild </p><p>as it seems. Some of the men who go out every </p><p>day to look after the crops and herds might be paid </p><p>to bring us food. . . .” </p><p> She stood in front of him. “How strange it would</p><p>be if one really could . . .” </p><p> “Why not?”</p><p> “But no one dares.”</p><p> “That is no reason.”</p><p> “It would be—oh! it would be so romantic and</p><p>strange. If only it were possible.” </p><p> “Why not possible?”</p><p> “There are so many things. Think of all the</p><p>things we have, things that we should miss.” </p><p>“Should we miss them? After all, the life we lead </p><p>is very unreal—very artificial.” He began to ex- </p><p>A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME </p><p>15 </p><p>panel his idea, aiiTi as he warmed to his exposition </p><p>the fantastic quality of his first proposal faded away. </p><p> She thought. “But I have heard of prowlers—</p><p>cscaped criminals.” </p><p> lie nodded. He hesitated over his answer be-</p><p>cause he thought it sounded boyish. He blushed. </p><p>“I could get some one I know to make me a sword.” </p><p> She looked at him with enthusiasm growing in her</p><p>eyes. She had heard of swords, had seen one in a </p><p>museum; she thought of those ancient days when </p><p>men wore them as a common thing. His suggestion </p><p>seemed an impossible dream to her, and perhaps for </p><p>that reason she was eager for more detail. And in- </p><p>venting for the most part as he went along, he told </p><p>her, how they might live in the country as the old- </p><p>world people had done. With every detail her in- </p><p>terest grew, for she was one of those girls tor whom </p><p>romance and adventure have a fascination. </p><p> His suggestion seemed, I say. an impossible dream</p><p>to her on that day, but the next day they talked about </p><p>it again, and it was strangely less impossible. </p><p> “At first we should take food,” said Denton. “We</p><p>could carry food for ten or twelve days.” It was an </p><p>age of compact artificial nourishment, and such a </p><p>provision had none of the unwieldy suggestion it </p><p>would have had in the nineteenth century. </p><p> “But—until our house." she asked—“until it was</p><p>ready, where should we sleep ?’’ </p><p> “It is summer.”</p><p> “But. . . . What do you mean?"</p><p> “There was a time when there were no houses in</p><p>the world; when all mankind slept always in the </p><p>open air.” </p><p> “But for us! The emptiness! No walls—no</p><p>ceiling!” </p><p> "Dear,” he said, “in London you have many beau-</p><p>tiful ceilings. Artists paint them and stud them </p><p>with lights. But I have seen a ceiling more beauti- </p><p>ful than any in London. . . .” </p><p> “But where?”</p><p> “It is the ceiling under which we two would be</p><p>alone . . .”</p><p> “You mean. . . .?”</p><p>“Dear,” he said, “it is something the world has </p><p>forgotten. It is Heaven and all the laost of stars." </p><p>EACH time they talked the thing seemed more </p><p>possible and more desirable to them. In a week </p><p>or so it was quite possible. Another week, and it </p><p>was the inevitable thing they had to do. A great en- </p><p>thusiasm for the country seized hold of them and </p><p>possessed them. The sordid tumult of the town, </p><p>they said, overwhelmed them. They marvelled that </p><p>this simple way out of their troubles had never come </p><p>upon them before. </p><p> One morning near Midsummer-day, there was a</p><p>new minor official upon the flying stage, and Den- </p><p>ton’s place was to know him no more. </p><p> Our two young people had secretly married, and</p><p>were going forth manfully out of the city in which </p><p>they and their ancestors before them had lived all </p><p>their days. She wore a new dress of white cut in an </p><p>old-fashioned pattern, and he had a bundle of pro- </p><p>visions strapped athwart his back, and in his hand he </p><p>carried—rather shame-facedlv it is true, and under </p><p>his purple cloak—an implement of archaic form, a </p><p>cross-hilted thing of tempered steel. </p><p> Imagine that going forth! In their days the</p><p>sprawling suburbs of Victorian times with their vile </p><p>roads, petty houses, foolish little gardens of shrub </p><p>and geranium, and all their futile, pretentious priva- </p><p>cies had disappeared; the towering buildings of the </p><p>new age, the mechanical ways, the electric and water </p><p>mains, all came to an end together like a wall, like </p><p>a cliff, near four hundred feet in height, abrupt and </p><p>sheer. All about the city spread the carrot, swede, </p><p>and turnip fields of the Food Company, vegetables </p><p>that were the basis of a thousand varied foods, and </p><p>weeds and hedgerow tangles had been utterly ex- </p><p>tirpated. The incessant expense of weeding that </p><p>went on year after year in the petty, wasteful and </p><p>barbaric farming of the ancient days, the Food Com- </p><p>pany had economised for ever more by a campaign </p><p>of extermination. Here and there, however, neat </p><p>rows of bramble standards and apple trees with </p><p>whitewashed stems, intersected the fields, and at </p><p>places groups of gigantic teazles reared their fav- </p><p>oured spikes. 1 lere and there huge agricultural ma- </p><p>chines hunched under waterproof covers. The </p><p>mingled waters of the Wey and Mole and Wandle </p><p>ran in rectangular channels; and wherever a gentle </p><p>elevation of the ground permitted a fountain of de- </p><p>odorised sewage distributed its benefits athwart the </p><p>land and made a rainbow 01 the sunlight.</p><p> By a great archway in that enormous city wall</p><p>emerged the Eadhamite road to Portsmouth, swarm- </p><p>ing in the morning sunshine with an enormous traffic </p><p>bearing the blue-clad servants of the Food Company </p><p>to their toil. A rushing traffic, beside which they </p><p>seemed two scarce-moving dots. Along the outer </p><p>tracks hummed and rattled the tardy little old-fash- </p><p>ioned motors of such as had duties within twenty </p><p>miles or so of the city; the inner ways were filled </p><p>with vaster mechanisms—swift monocycles bearing a </p><p>score of men, lank multicycles, quadricycles sagging </p><p>with heavy loads, empty gigantic produce carts that </p><p>would come back again filled before the sun was </p><p>setting, all with throbbing engines and noiseless </p><p>wheels and a perpetual wild melody of horns and </p><p>gongs. </p><p> Along the very verge of the outermost way our</p><p>young people went in silence, newly wed and oddly </p><p>shy of one another’s company. Many were the </p><p>things shouted to thenras they tramped along, for in </p><p>2100 a foot-passenger on an English road was al- </p><p>most as strange a sight as a motor car would have </p><p>been in 1800. But they went on with steadfast eyes </p><p>into the country, paying no heed to such cries. </p><p> Before them in the south rose the Downs, blue at</p><p>first, and as they came nearer, changing to green, </p><p>surmounted by the row of gigantic wind-wheels that </p><p>supplemented the wind-wheels upon the roof-spaces </p><p>of the city, and broken and restless with the long </p><p>morning shadows of those whirling vanes. By mid- </p><p>day they had come so near that they could see here </p><p>and there little patches of pallid dots—the sheep the </p><p>Meat Department of the Food Company owned. In </p><p>another hour they had passed the clay and the root </p><p>crops and the single fence that hedged them in, and </p><p>the prohibition against trespass no longer held: the </p><p>levelled roadway plunged into a cutting with all its </p><p>traffic, and they could leave it and walk over *the </p><p>greensward and up the open hillside. </p><p> Never had these children of the latter days been</p><p>together in such a lonely place. </p><p> They were both very hungry and footsore—for</p><p>walking was a rare exercise—and presently they sat </p><p>down on the weedless, close-cropped grass, and </p><p>looked back for the first time at the city from which </p><p>they had come, shining wide and splendid in the blue </p><p>16 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>haze of the valley of the Thames. Elizabeth was a </p><p>little afraid of the unenclosed sheep away up the </p><p>slope—she had never been near big unrestrained </p><p>animals before—but Denton reassured her. And </p><p>overhead a white-winged bird circled in the blue. </p><p> They talked but little until they had eaten, and</p><p>then their tongues were loosened. He spoke of the </p><p>happiness that was now certainly theirs, of the folly </p><p>of not breaking sooner out of the magnificent prison </p><p>of latter-day life, of the old romantic days that had </p><p>passed from the world for ever. And then he be- </p><p>came boastful. He took up the sword that lay on </p><p>the ground beside him, and she took it from his hand </p><p>and ran a tremulous finger along the blade. </p><p> "And you could,” she said, “you—could raise this</p><p>and strike a man ?” </p><p> "Why not? If there were need.''</p><p> "But," she said, "it seems so horrible. It woulc</p><p>slash . . . There would be"—her voice sank,— </p><p>‘‘blood. ” </p><p> "In the old romances you have read often enough</p><p> “Oh, I know: in those —yes. But that is different.</p><p>One knows it is not blood, but just a sort of red </p><p>ink . . . And you—killing!” </p><p> Sire looked at him doubtfully, and then handed</p><p>him back the sword. </p><p>AFTER they had rested and eaten, they rose up </p><p>and went on their way towards the hills. They </p><p>passed quite close to a huge flock of sheep, who stared </p><p>and bleated at their unaccustomed figures. She had </p><p>never seen sheep before, and she shivered to think </p><p>such gentle things must needs he slain for food. A </p><p>sheep-dog barked from a distance, and then a shep- </p><p>herd appeared amidst the supports of the wind- </p><p>wheels, and came down towards them. </p><p> When he drew near he called out asking whither</p><p>they were going. </p><p> Denton hesitated, and told him briefly that theji</p><p>sought some ruined house among the Downs, in </p><p>which they might live together. He tried to speak </p><p>in an off-hand manner, as though it was a usual thing </p><p>to do. The man stared incredulously. </p><p> "Have you done anything?” he asked.</p><p> "Nothing,” said Denton. "Only we don’t want</p><p>to live in a city any longer. Why should we live in </p><p>cities ?” </p><p> The shepherd stared more incredulously than</p><p>ever. “You can’t live here,” he said. </p><p> “We mean to try.”</p><p> The shepherd stared from one to the other.</p><p>“You'll go back to-morrow,” he said. “It looks </p><p>pleasant enough in the sunlight. . . . Are you sure </p><p>you’ve done nothing? We shepherds are not such </p><p>great friends of the police.” </p><p> Denton looked at him steadfastly. “No,” he said.</p><p>“But we are too poor to live in the city, and we </p><p>can't bear the thought of wearing clothes of blue </p><p>canvas and doing drudgery. We are going to live </p><p>a simple life here, like the people of old.” </p><p> The shepherd was a bearded man with a thought-</p><p>ful face. He glanced at Elizabeth’s fragile beauty. </p><p> “They had simple minds,” he said.</p><p> "So have we,” said Denton.</p><p> The shepherd smiled.</p><p> "If you go along here,” he said, “along the crest</p><p>beneath the wind-wheels, you will see a heap of </p><p>mounds and ruins on your right-hand side. That </p><p>was once a town called Epsom. There are no houses </p><p>there, and the bricks have been used for a sheep </p><p>pen. Go on, and another heap on the edge of the </p><p>root-land is Leatherhead; and then the hill turns </p><p>away along the border of a valley, and there are </p><p>woods of beech. Keep along the crest. You will </p><p>come to quite wild places. In some parts, in spite </p><p>of all the weeding that is done, ferns and bluebells </p><p>and other such useless plants are growing still. And </p><p>through it all underneath the wind-wheels runs a </p><p>straight lane paved with stones, a roadway of the </p><p>Romans two thousand years old. Go to the right of </p><p>that, down into the valley and follow it along by the </p><p>banks of the river. You come presently to a street </p><p>of houses, many with the roofs still sound upon </p><p>them. There you may find shelter. </p><p> They thanked him.</p><p> "But it’s a quiet place. There is no light after</p><p>dark there, and I have heard tell of robbers. It is </p><p>lonely. Nothing happens there. The phonographs </p><p>of the story-tellers, the kinematograph entertain- </p><p>ments, the news machines—none of them are to be</p><p>found there. If you are hungry there is no food, </p><p>if you are ill 110 doctor. . . He stopped. </p><p> "We shall try it,” said Denton, moving to go on.</p><p>Then a thought struck him, and he made an agree- </p><p>ment with the shepherd, and learnt where they might </p><p>find him, to buy and bring them anything of which </p><p>they stood in need, out of the city. </p><p>AND in the evening they came to the deserted </p><p>village, with its houses that seemed so small </p><p>and odd to them: they found it golden in the glory </p><p>of the sunset, and desolate and still. They went from </p><p>one deserted house to another, marvelling at their </p><p>quaint simplicity, and debating which they should </p><p>choose. And at last, in a sunlit corner of a room </p><p>that had lost its outer wall, they came upon a wild </p><p>flower, a little flower of blue that the weeders of the </p><p>Food Company had overlooked. </p><p> That house they decided upon; but they did not</p><p>remain in it long that night, because they were </p><p>resolved to feast upon nature. And moreover the </p><p>.louses became very gaunt and shadowy after the </p><p>sunlight had faded out of the sky. So after they </p><p>had rested a little time they went to the crest of the </p><p>hill again to see with their own eyes the silence of </p><p>heaven set with stars, about which the old poets had </p><p>had so many things to tell. It was a wonderful sight, </p><p>and Denton talked like the stars, and when they </p><p>went down the hill at last the sky was pale with </p><p>dawn. They slept but, little, and in the morning </p><p>when they woke a thrush was singing in a tree. </p><p> So these young people of the twenty-second cen-</p><p>tury began their exile. That morning they were </p><p>very busy exploring the resources of this new home </p><p>in which they were going to live the simple life. </p><p>They did not explore very fast or very far, because </p><p>they went everywhere hand-in-hand; but they found </p><p>the beginnings of some furniture. Beyond the vil- </p><p>lage was a store of winter fodder for the sheep of. </p><p>the Food Company, and Denton dragged great arm- </p><p>fuls to the house to make a bed; and in several of </p><p>the houses were old fungus-eaten chairs and tables </p><p>—rough, barbaric, clumsy furniture, it seemed to </p><p>them, and made of wood. They repeated many of </p><p>the things they had said on the previous day, and </p><p>towards evening they found another flower, a hare- </p><p>bell. In the late afternoon some Company shep- </p><p>A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME </p><p>17 </p><p>herds went down the river valley riding on a big </p><p>multicycle; but they hid from them, because their </p><p>-presence, Elizabeth said, seemed to spoil the romance </p><p>of this old-world place altogether. </p><p> In this fashion they lived a week. For all that</p><p>week the days were cloudless, and the nights, nights </p><p>of starry glory, that were invaded each a little more </p><p>by a crescent moon. </p><p> Yet something of the first splendour of their com-</p><p>ing faded—faded imperceptibly day after day; Den- </p><p>ton’s eloquence became fitful, and lacked fresh topics </p><p>of inspiration; the fatigue of their long march from </p><p>London told in a certain stiffness of the limbs, and </p><p>each suffered from a slight unaccountable cold. </p><p>Moreover, Denton became aware of unoccupied time. </p><p>In one place among the carelessly heaped lumber of </p><p>the old times he found a rust-eaten spade, and with </p><p>this he made a fitful attack on the razed and grass- </p><p>grown garden—though he had nothing to plant or </p><p>sow. He returned to Elizabeth with a sweat-stream- </p><p>ing face, after half an hour of such work. </p><p> “There were giants in those days,” he said, not</p><p>understanding what wont and training will do. And </p><p>their walk that day led them along the hills until </p><p>they could see the city shimmering far away in the </p><p>valley. “I wonder how things are going on there,” </p><p>he said. </p><p> And then came a change in the weather. “Come</p><p>out and see the clouds,” she cried; and behold! they </p><p>were a sombre purple in the north and east, stream- </p><p>ing up to ragged edges at the zenith. And as they </p><p>went up the hill these hurrying streamers blotted </p><p>out the sunset. Suddenly the wind set the beech- </p><p>trees swaying and whispering, and Elizabeth shiv- </p><p>ered. And then far away the lightning flashed, </p><p>flashed like a sword that is drawn suddenly, and the </p><p>distant thunder marched about the sky, and even </p><p>as they stood astonished, pattering upon them came </p><p>the first headlong raindrops of the storm. In an </p><p>instant the last streak of sunset was hidden by a </p><p>falling curtain of hail, and the lightning flashed </p><p>again, and the voice of the thunder roared louder, </p><p>and all about them the world scowled dark and </p><p>strange. </p><p> Seizing hands, these children of the city ran down</p><p>the hill to their home, in infinite astonishment. And </p><p>ere they reached it. Elizabeth was weeping with </p><p>dismay, and the darkling ground about them was </p><p>white and brittle and active with the pelting hail. </p><p> Then began a strange and terrible night for them.</p><p>For the first time in their civilised lives they were </p><p>in absolute darkness; they were wet and cold and </p><p>shivering, all about them hissed the hail, and through </p><p>the long neglected ceilings of the derelict home came </p><p>noisy spouts of water and formed pools and rivulets </p><p>on the creaking floors. As the gusts of the storm </p><p>struck the worn-out building, it groaned and shud- </p><p>dered, and now a mass of plaster from the wall </p><p>would slide and smash, and now some loosened tile </p><p>would rattle down the roof and crash into the empty </p><p>greenhouse below. Elizabeth shuddered, and was </p><p>still; Denton wrapped his gay and flimsy city cloak </p><p>about her, and so they crouched in the darkness. </p><p>And ever the thunder broke louder and nearer, and </p><p>ever more lurid flashed the lightning, jerking into </p><p>a momentary gaunt clearness the steaming, dripping </p><p>room in which they sheltered. </p><p> Never before had they been in the open air save</p><p>when the sun was shining. All their time had been </p><p>spent in the warm and airy ways and halls and rooms </p><p>of the latter-day city. It was to them that night </p><p>as if they were in some other world, some disordered </p><p>chaos of stress and tumult, and almost beyond hop- </p><p>ing that they should ever see the city ways again. </p><p> The storm seemed to last interminably, until at</p><p>last they dozed between the thunderclaps, and then </p><p>very swiftly it fell and ceased. And as the last </p><p>patter of the rain died away they heard an un- </p><p>familiar sound. </p><p>ffTTTTIAT is that?” cried Elizabeth. </p><p> VV It came again. It was the barking of</p><p>dogs. It drove down the desert lane and passed; </p><p>and through the window, whitening the wall before </p><p>them and throwing upon it the shadow of the win- </p><p>dow-frame and of a tree in black silhouette, shone </p><p>the light of the waxing moon. . . . </p><p> Just as the pale dawn was drawing the things</p><p>about them into sight, the fitful barking of dogs </p><p>came near again, and stopped. They listened. After </p><p>a pause they heard the quick pattering of feet seek- </p><p>ing round the house, and short, half-smothered barks. </p><p>Then again everything was still. </p><p> “Ssh!” whispered Elizabeth, and pointed to the</p><p>door of their room. </p><p> Denton went half-way towards the door, and</p><p>stood listening. He came back with a face of af- </p><p>fected unconcern. “They must be the sheep-dogs </p><p>of the Food Company,” he said. “They will do us </p><p>no harm.”</p><p> He sat down again beside her. “What a night</p><p>it has been!” he said, to hide how keenly he was </p><p>listening. </p><p> “I don’t like dogs,” answered Elizabeth, after a</p><p>long silence. </p><p> “Dogs never hurt any one,” said Denton. “In</p><p>the old days—in the nineteenth century—everybody </p><p>had a dog.” </p><p> “There was a romance I heard once. A dog</p><p>killed a man.” </p><p> “Not this sort of dog,” said Denton confidently.</p><p>“Some of those romances—are exaggerated.” </p><p> Suddenly a half bark and a pattering up the stair-</p><p>case; the sound of panting. Denton sprang to his </p><p>feet and drew the sword out of the damp straw upon </p><p>which they had been lying. Then in the doorway </p><p>appeared a gaunt sheep-dog, and halted there. Be- </p><p>hind it stared another. For an instant man and </p><p>brute faced each other, hesitating. </p><p> Then Denton, being ignorant of dogs, made a</p><p>sharp step forward. “Go away,” he said, with a </p><p>clumsy motion of his sword. </p><p> The dog started and growled. Denton stopped</p><p>sharply. “Good dog!” he said. </p><p> The growling jerked into a bark.</p><p> “Good dog!” said Denton. The second dog</p><p>growled and barked. A third out of sight down the </p><p>staircase took up the barking also. Outside others </p><p>gave tongue—a large number, it seemed to Denton. </p><p> “This is annoying,” said Denton, without taking</p><p>his eye off the brutes before him. “Of course the </p><p>shepherds won’t come out of the city for hours yet. </p><p>Naturally these dogs don’t quite make us out.” </p><p> “I can’t hear!” shouted Elizabeth. She stood up</p><p>and came to him. </p><p> Denton tried again, but the barking still drowned</p><p>his voice. The sound had a curious effect upon his </p><p>blood. Odd disused emotions began to stir; his face </p><p>18 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>changed as lie shouted. He tried again; the bark- </p><p>ing seemed to mock him, and one dog danced a pace </p><p>forward, bristling. Suddenly he turned, and utter- </p><p>ing certain words in the dialect of the underways, </p><p>words incomprehensible to Elizabeth, he made for </p><p>the dogs. There was a sudden cessation of the bark- </p><p>ing, a growl and a snapping. Elizabeth saw the </p><p>snarling head of the foremost dog, its white teeth </p><p>and retracted ears, and the flash of the thrust blade. </p><p>The brute leapt into the air and was flung back. </p><p> Then Denton, with a shout, was driving the dogs</p><p>before him. The sword flashed above his head with </p><p>a sudden new freedom of gesture, and then he van- </p><p>ished down the staircase. She made six steps to </p><p>follow him, and on the landing there was blood. </p><p>She stopped, and hearing the tumult of dogs and </p><p>Denton’s shouts pass out of the house, ran to the </p><p>window. </p><p> Nine wolfish sheep-dogs were scattering, one</p><p>writhed before the porch; and Denton, tasting that </p><p>strange delight of combat that slumbers still in the </p><p>blood of even the most civilized man, was shouting </p><p>and running across the garden space. And then she </p><p>saw something that for a moment he did not see. </p><p>The dogs circled round this way and that, and came </p><p>again. They had him in the open. </p><p> In an instant she divined the situation. She would</p><p>have called to him. For a moment she felt sick and </p><p>helpless, and then, obeying a strange impulse, she </p><p>gathered up her white skirt and ran downstairs. In </p><p>the hall was the rusting spade. That was it! She </p><p>seized it and ran out. </p><p> She came none too soon. One dog rolled before</p><p>him, well-nigh slashed in hal f; but a second had him </p><p>by the thigh, a third gripped his collar behind, and </p><p>a fourth had the blade of the sword between its </p><p>teeth, tasting its own blood. He parried the leap of </p><p>a fifth with his left arm. </p><p> It might have been the first century instead of the</p><p>twenty-second, so far as she was concerned. All </p><p>the gentleness of her eighteen years of city life van- </p><p>ished before the primordial need. The spade smote </p><p>hard and sure, and cleft a dog’s skull. Another, </p><p>crouching for a spring, yelped with dismay at this </p><p>unexpected antagonist, and rushed aside. Two </p><p>wasted precious moments on the binding of a femi- </p><p>nine skirt. </p><p> The collar of Denton’s cloak tore and parted as</p><p>he staggered back; and that dog too felt the Spade,</p><p>and ceased to trouble him. He sheathed his sword </p><p>in the brute at his thigh. </p><p> “To the wall!” cried Elizabeth; and in three sec-</p><p>onds the fight was at an end, and our young people </p><p>stood side by side, while a remnant of five dogs, </p><p>with ears and tails of disaster, fled shamefully from </p><p>the stricken field. </p><p> For a moment they stood panting and victorious,</p><p>and then Elizabeth, dropping her spade, covered her </p><p>face, and sank to the ground in a paroxysm of weep- </p><p>ing. Denton looked about him, thrust the point of </p><p>his sword into the ground so that it was at hand, </p><p>and stooped to comfort her. </p><p>AT last their more tumultuous emotions subsided, </p><p>and they could talk again. She leant upon the </p><p>wall, and he sat upon it so that he could keep an eye </p><p>open for any returning dogs. Two, at any rate, were </p><p>up on the hillside and keeping up a vexatious barking. </p><p> She was tear-stained, but not very wretched now,</p><p>because for half an hour he had been repeating that </p><p> she was brave and had saved his life. But a new</p><p> fear was growing in her mind.</p><p> “They are the dogs of the Food Company,” she</p><p> said. “There will be trouble.”</p><p> “I am afraid so. Very likely they will prosecute</p><p> us for trespass.”</p><p> A pause.</p><p> “In the old times,” he said, “this sort of thing</p><p> happened day after day.”</p><p> "Last night!” she said. “I could not live through</p><p> another such night.”</p><p> He looked at her. Her face was pale for want of</p><p> sleep, and drawn and haggard. He came to a sudden</p><p> resolution. “We must go back,” he said.</p><p> She looked at the dead dogs, and shivered. “We</p><p> cannot stay here,” she said.</p><p> “We must go back,” he repeated, glancing over</p><p> his shoulder to see if the enemy kept their distance.</p><p> “We have been happy for a time. . . . Ryt the world</p><p> is too civilized. Ours is the age of cities. More</p><p> of this will kill us.”</p><p> “But what are we to do? How can we live there?"</p><p> Denton hesitated. His heel kicked against the wall</p><p> on which he sat. “It's a thing I haven’t mentioned</p><p> before,” he said, and coughed; “but . . .”</p><p> “Yes?”</p><p> “You could raise money on your expectations,”</p><p> he said.</p><p> “Could I ?” she said eagerly.</p><p> “Of course you could. What a child you are!”</p><p> She stood up, and her face was bright. “Why did</p><p> you not tell me before?” she asked. “And all this</p><p> time we have been here!”</p><p> He looked at her for a moment, and smiled. Then</p><p> the smile vanished. “I thought it ought to come</p><p> from you,” he said. “I didn’t like to ask for your</p><p> money. And besides—at first I thought this would</p><p> be rather fine.”</p><p> There was a pause.</p><p> “It has been fine," he said; and glanced once more</p><p> over his shoulder. “Until all this began.”</p><p> “Yes,” she said, “those first days. The first three</p><p> days.”</p><p> They looked for a space into one another’s faces,</p><p> and then Denton slid down from the wall and took</p><p> her hand.</p><p> “To each generation,” he said, “the life of its</p><p> time. I see it all plainly now. In the city—that is</p><p> the life to which we were born. To live in any other</p><p> fashion. . . . Coming here was a dream, and this—is</p><p> the awakening.”</p><p> “It was a pleasant dream,” she said,—“in the</p><p> beginning.”</p><p> For a long space neither spoke.</p><p> “If we would reach the city before the shepherds</p><p> come here, we must start,” said Denton. “We must</p><p> get our food out of the house and eat as we go.”</p><p> Denton glanced about him again, and, giving the</p><p> dead dogs a wide berth, they walked across the gar-</p><p> den space and into the house together. They found .</p><p> the wallet with their food, and descended the blood-</p><p> stained stairs again. In the hall Elizabeth stopped.</p><p> “One minute,” she said. “There is something here.”</p><p> She led the way into the room in which that one</p><p> little blue flower was blooming. She stooped to it,</p><p> she touched it with her hand.</p><p> “I want it," she said; and then, “I cannot take</p><p> it____”</p><p> Impulsively she stooped and kissed its petals.</p><p> Then silently, side by side, they went across the</p><p>A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME </p><p>19 </p><p> empty garden-space into the old high road, and set</p><p> their faces resolutely towards the distant city—</p><p> towards the complex mechanical city of those latter</p><p> days, the city that had swallowed up mankind.</p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>The Ways of the City </p><p>PROMINENT if not paramount among world- </p><p>changing inventions in the history of man is </p><p>that series of contrivances in locomotion that </p><p>began with the railway and ended for a century or </p><p>more with the motor and the patent road. That </p><p>these contrivances, together with the device of lim- </p><p>ited liability joint stock companies and the super- </p><p>session of agricultural laborers by skilled men with </p><p>ingenious machinery, would necessarily concentrate </p><p>mankind in cities of unparalleled magnitude and </p><p>work an entire revolution in human life, became, </p><p>after the event, a thing so obvious that it is a matter </p><p>of astonishment it was not more clearly anticipated. </p><p>Yet that any steps should be taken to anticipate the </p><p>miseries such a revolution might entail does not ap- </p><p>pear even to have been suggested; and the idea that </p><p>the moral prohibitions and sanctions, the privileges </p><p>and concessions, the conception of property and re- </p><p>sponsibility, of comfort and beauty, that had ren- </p><p>dered the mainly agricultural states of the past pros- </p><p>perous and happy, would fail in the rising torrent </p><p>of novel opportunities and novel stimulations, never </p><p>seems to have entered the nineteenth-century mind. </p><p>That a citizen, kindly and fair in his ordinary life, </p><p>could as a shareholder become almost murderously </p><p>greedy; that commercial methods that were reason- </p><p>able and honorable on the old-fashioned countryside, </p><p>should on an enlarged scale be deadly and over- </p><p>whelming ; that ancient charity was modern pauperi- </p><p>zation, and ancient employment modern sweating; </p><p>that, in fact, a revision and enlargement of the duties </p><p>and rights of man had become urgently necessary, </p><p>were things it could not entertain, nourished as it </p><p>was on an archaic system of education and pro- </p><p>foundly restrospective and legal in all its habits of </p><p>thought. It was known that the accumulation of </p><p>men in cities involved unprecedented dangers of </p><p>pestilence; there was an energetic development of </p><p>sanitation; but that the diseases of gambling and </p><p>usury, of luxury and tyranny should become en- </p><p>demic, and produce horrible consequences was be- </p><p>yond the scope of nineteenth-century thought. And </p><p>so, as if it were some inorganic process, practically </p><p>unhindered by the creative will of man, the growth </p><p>of the swarming unhappy cities that mark the twenty- </p><p>first century accomplished itself. </p><p> The new society was divided into three main</p><p>classes. At the summit slumbered the property </p><p>owner, enormously rich by accident rather than de- </p><p>sign, potent save for the will and aim, the last avatar </p><p>of Hamlet in the world. Below was the enormous </p><p>multitude of workers employed by the gigantic com- </p><p>panies that monopolized control; and between these </p><p>two the dwindling middle class, officials of innumer- </p><p>able sorts, foremen, managers, the medical, legal, </p><p>artistic, and scholastic classes, and the minor rich, a </p><p>middle class whose members led a life of insecure </p><p>luxury and precarious speculation amidst the move- </p><p>ments of the great managers. </p><p>Already the love story and the marrying of two </p><p>persons of this middle class have been told: how </p><p>they overcame the obstacles between them, and how </p><p>they tried the simple old-fashioned way of living on </p><p>the countryside and came back speedily enough into </p><p>the city of London. Denton had no means, so Eliza- </p><p>beth borrowed money on the securities that her father </p><p>Mwres held in trust for her until she was one-and- </p><p>twenty. </p><p> The rate of interest she paid was of course high,</p><p>because of the uncertainty of her security, and the </p><p>arithmetic of lovers is often sketchy and optimistic. </p><p>Yet they had very glorious times after that return. </p><p>They determined they would not go to a Pleasure </p><p>city nor waste their days rushing through the air </p><p>from one part of the world to the other, for in spite </p><p>of one disillusionment, their tastes were still old- </p><p>fashioned. They furnished their little room with </p><p>quaint old Victorian furniture, and found a shop on </p><p>the forty-second floor in Seventh Way, where printed </p><p>books of the old sort were still to be bought. It was </p><p>their pet affectation to read print instead of hearing </p><p>phonographs. And when presently there came a </p><p>sweet little girl, to unite them further if it were pos- </p><p>sible, Elizabeth would not send it to a Creche, as the </p><p>custom was, but insisted on nursing it at home. The </p><p>rent of their apartments was raised on account of </p><p>this singular proceeding, but that they did not mind. </p><p>It only meant borrowing a little more. </p><p> Presently Elizabeth was of age. and Denton had</p><p>a business interview with her father that was not </p><p>agreeable. An exceedingly disagreeable interview </p><p>with their money-lender followed, from which he </p><p>brought home a white face. On his return Eliza- </p><p>beth had to tell him of a new and marvelous intona- </p><p>tion of “Goo" that their daughter had devised, but </p><p>Denton was inattentive. In the midst, just as she </p><p>was at the cream of her description, he interrupted. </p><p>“How much money do you think we have left, now </p><p>that everything is settled?” </p><p> She stared and stopped her appreciative swaying</p><p>of the Goo genius that had accompanied her de- </p><p>scription. </p><p> “You don’t mean . . .?”</p><p> “Yes,” he answered. “Ever so much. We have</p><p>been wild. It’s the interest. Or something. And </p><p>the shares you had, slumped. Your father did not </p><p>mind. Said it was not his business, after what had </p><p>happened. He’s going to marry again. . . . Well— </p><p>we have scarcely a thousand left!” </p><p> “Only a thousand?”</p><p> “Only a thousand.”</p><p> And Elizabeth sat down. For a moment she re-</p><p>garded him with a white face, then her eyes went </p><p>about the quaint, old-fashioned room, with its mid- </p><p>dle Victorian furniture and genuine oleographs, and </p><p>rested at last on the little lump of humanity within </p><p>her arms. </p><p>DENTON glanced at her and stood downcast. </p><p>Then he swung round on his heel and walked </p><p>up and down very rapidly. </p><p> “I must get something to do,” he broke out pres-</p><p>ently. “I am an idle scoundrel. I ought to have </p><p>thought of this before. I have been a selfish fool. </p><p>I wanted to be with you all day .. </p><p> He stopped, looking at her white face. Suddenly</p><p>he came and kissed her and the little face that nestled </p><p>against her breast. </p><p> “It’s all right, dear,” he said, standing over her;</p><p>“you won’t be lonely now—now Dings is beginning </p><p>to talk to you. And I can soon get something to do, </p><p>20 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>you know. Soon . . . Easily . . . It’s only a shock at </p><p>first. But it will come all right. It’s sure to come </p><p>right. I will go out again as soon as I have rested, </p><p>and find what can lie done. For the present it’s hard </p><p>to think of anything . . </p><p> ‘‘It would be hard to leave these rooms,” said</p><p>Elizabeth; "but—” </p><p> “There won’t be any need of that—trust me.”</p><p> “They are expensive.”</p><p> Denton waved that aside. He began talking of</p><p>the work he could do. He was not very explicit </p><p>what it would be; but he was quite sure that there </p><p>was something to keep them comfortably in the </p><p>happy middle class, whose way of life was the only </p><p>one they knew. </p><p> “There are three-and-thirty million people in Lon-</p><p>don." he said: “some of them must have need of me.” </p><p>“Some must.” </p><p> “The trouble is . . . Well—Bindon, that brown</p><p>little old man your father wanted you to marry. </p><p>He’s an important person. ... I can’t go back to my </p><p>flying-stage work, because he is now a Commissioner </p><p>of the Flying Stage Clerks.” </p><p> “1 didn’t know that,” said Elizabeth.</p><p> “He was made that in the last few weeks ... or</p><p>things would be easy enough, for they liked me on </p><p>the flying stage. But there’s dozens of other things </p><p>to be done—dozens. Don’t you worry, dear. I’ll </p><p>rest a little while, and then we’ll dine, and then I'll </p><p>start on my rounds. I know lots of people—lots.” </p><p>So they rested, and then they went to the public </p><p>dining-room and dined, and then he started on his </p><p>search for employment. But they soon realized that </p><p>in the matter of one convenience the world was just </p><p>as badly off as it had ever been, and that was a nice, </p><p>secure, honorable, remunerative employment, leaving </p><p>ample leisure for the private life, and demanding </p><p>no special ability, no violent exertion or risk, and </p><p>no sacrifice of any sort for its attainment. He </p><p>evolved a number of brilliant projects, and spent </p><p>many days hurrying from one part of the enormous </p><p>city to another in search of influential friends; and </p><p>all his influential friends were glad to see him, and </p><p>very sanguine until it came to definite proposals, </p><p>and then they became guarded and vague. He would </p><p>part with them coldly, and think over their behavior, </p><p>and get irritated on his way back, and stop at some </p><p>telephone office and spend money on an animated but</p><p>unprofitable quarrel. And as the days passed, he </p><p>got so worried and irritated that even to seem kind </p><p>and careless before Elizabeth cost him an effort—as </p><p>she, being a loving woman, perceived very clearly. </p><p> After an extremely complex preface one day, she</p><p>helped him out with a painful suggestion. He had </p><p>expected her to weep and give way to despair when </p><p>it came to selling all their joyfully bought early Vic- </p><p>torian treasures, their quaint objects of art, their </p><p>antimacassars, bead mats, repp curtains, veneered </p><p>furniture, gold-framed steel engravings and pencil </p><p>drawings, wax flowers under shades, stuffed birds, </p><p>and all sorts of choice old things; but it was she </p><p>who made the proposal. The sacrifice seemed to fill </p><p>her with pleasure, and so did the idea of shifting to </p><p>apartments ten or twelve floors lower in another </p><p>hotel. “So long as Dings is with us, nothing mat- </p><p>ters,” she said. “It’s all experience.” So he kissed </p><p>her, said she was braver than when she fought the </p><p>sheep-dogs, called her Boadicea. and abstained very </p><p>carefully from reminding her that they would have </p><p>to pay a considerably higher rent on account of the </p><p>little voice with which Dings greeted the perpetual </p><p>uproar of the city. </p><p> His idea had been to get Elizabeth out of the way</p><p>when it came to selling the absurd furniture about </p><p>which their affections were twined and tangled; but </p><p>when it came to the sale it was Elizabeth who hag- </p><p>gled with the dealer while Denton went about the </p><p>running ways of the city, white and sick with sor- </p><p>row and the fear of what was still to come. When </p><p>they moved into their sparsely furnished pink-and- </p><p>white apartments in a cheap hotel, there came an </p><p>outbreak of furious energy on his part, and then </p><p>nearly a week of lethargy during which he sulked </p><p>at home. Through those days Elizabeth shone like </p><p>a star, and at the end Denton’s misery found a vent </p><p>in tears. And then he went out into the city ways </p><p>again, and—to his utter amazement—found some </p><p>work to do. </p><p> His standard of employment had fallen steadily</p><p>until at last it had reached the lowest level of inde- </p><p>pendent workers. At first he had aspired to some </p><p>high official position in the great Flying or Windvane </p><p>or Water Companies, or to an appointment on one </p><p>of the General Intelligence Organizations that had </p><p>replaced newspapers, or to some professional part- </p><p>nership, but those were the dreams of the beginning. </p><p>From that he had passed to speculation, and three </p><p>hundred gold “lions” out of Elizabeth’s thousand </p><p>had vanished one evening in the share market. Now </p><p>he was glad his good looks secured him a trial in the </p><p>position of salesman to the Suzannah Hat Syndicate, </p><p>a Syndicate dealing in ladies’ caps, hair decorations,</p><p>and hats—for though the city was completely cov- </p><p>ered in, ladies still wore extremely elaborate and </p><p>beautiful hats at the theatres and places of public </p><p>worship. </p><p>IT would have been amusing if one could have </p><p>confronted a Regent Street shopkeeper of the </p><p>nineteenth century with the development of his estab- </p><p>lishment in which Denton’s duties lay. Nineteenth </p><p>Way was still sometimes called Regent Street, but </p><p>it was now a street of moving platforms and nearly </p><p>eight hundred feet wide. The middle space was </p><p>immovable and gave access by staircases descend- </p><p>ing into subterranean ways to the houses on either </p><p>side. Right and left were an ascending series of </p><p>continuous platforms each of which traveled about </p><p>five miles an hour faster than the one internal to it. </p><p>so that one could step from platform to platform </p><p>until one reached the swiftest outer way and so go </p><p>about the city. The establishment of the Suzannah </p><p>Hat Syndicate projected a vast facade upon the </p><p>outer way, sending out overhead at either end an </p><p>overlapping series of huge white glass screens, on </p><p>which gigantic animated pictures of the faces of well- </p><p>known beautiful living women wearing novelties in </p><p>hats were thrown. A dense crowd was always col- </p><p>lected in the stationary central way watching a vast </p><p>kinematograph which displayed the changing fash- </p><p>ion. The whole front of the building was in per- * </p><p>petual chromatic change, and all down the facadc— </p><p>four hundred feet it measured—and all across the </p><p>street of moving ways, laced and winked and glit- </p><p>tered in a thousand varieties of color and lettering </p><p>the inscription— </p><p> Susanna! ’ets! Suzanna! ’ets!</p><p> A broadside of gigantic phonographs drowned all</p><p>conversation in the moving way and roared “hats” </p><p>A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME </p><p>21 </p><p>at the passer-by, while far down the street and up, </p><p>other batteries counseled the public to “walk down </p><p>for Suzannah,” and queried, “Why don't you buy </p><p>the girl a hat ?” </p><p> For the benefit of those who chanced to be deaf</p><p>—and deafness was not uncommon in the London </p><p>of that age, inscriptions of all sizes were thrown </p><p>from the roof above upon the moving platforms </p><p>themselves, and on one’s hand or on the bald head </p><p>of the man l&gt;efore one, or on a lady’s shoulders, or </p><p>in a sudden jet of flame before one’s feet, the mov- </p><p>ing finger wrote in unanticipated letters of fire “ets </p><p>r chip t'dc,” or simply “cts.” And despite all these </p><p>efforts so high was the pitch at which the city lived, </p><p>so trained became one’s eyes and ears to ignore all </p><p>sorts of advertisement, that many a citizen had </p><p>passed that place thousands of times and was still </p><p>unaware of the existence of the Suzannah Hat </p><p>Syndicate. </p><p> To enter the building one descended the staircase</p><p>in the middle way and walked through a public </p><p>passage in which pretty girls promenaded, girls who </p><p>were willing to wear a ticketed hat for a small fee. </p><p>The entrance chamber was a large hall in which wax </p><p>heads fashionably adorned rotated gracefully upon </p><p>pedestals, and from this one passed through a cash </p><p>office to an interminable series of little rooms, each </p><p>with its salesman, its three or four hats and pins, </p><p>its mirrors, its kinematographs, telephones and hat </p><p>slides in communication with the central depot, its </p><p>comfortable lounge and tempting refreshments. A </p><p>salesman in such an apartment did. Denton now be- </p><p>come. It was his business to attend to any of the </p><p>incessant stream of ladies who chose to stop with </p><p>him. to behave as winningly as possible, to offer re- </p><p>freshment, to converse on any topic the possible cus- </p><p>tomer chose, and to guide the conversation dexter- </p><p>ously but not insistently towards hats. He was to </p><p>suggest trying on various types of hat and to show </p><p>by his manner and bearing, but without any coarse </p><p>flattery, the enhanced impression made by the hats </p><p>lie wished to sell. He had several mirrors, adapted </p><p>by various subtleties of curvature and tint to differ- </p><p>ent types of face and complexion, and much de- </p><p>pended on the proper use of these. </p><p> Denton flung himself at these curious and not</p><p>very congenial duties with a good will and energy </p><p>that would have amazed him a year before; but all to </p><p>no purpose. The Senior Manageress, who had </p><p>selected him for appointment and conferred various </p><p>small marks of favor upon him, suddenly changed </p><p>in her manner, declared for 110 assignable cause that</p><p>he was stupid, and dismissed him at the end of six </p><p>weeks of salesmanship. So Denton had to resume </p><p>his ineffectual search for employment. </p><p> This second search did not last very long. Their</p><p>money was at the ebb. To eke it out a little longer </p><p>they resolved to part with their darling Dings, and </p><p>took that small person to one of the public crbches </p><p>that abounded in the city. That was the common </p><p>use of the time. The industrial emancipation of </p><p>women, the correlated disorganization of the se- </p><p>cluded “home,” had rendered crt-chcs a necessity for </p><p>all but very rich and exceptionally-minded people. </p><p>Therein children encountered hygienic and educa- </p><p>tional advantages impossible without such organiza- </p><p>tion. Creches were of all classes and types of luxury, </p><p>down to those of the labor Company, where children </p><p>were taken on credit, to be redeemed in labor as </p><p>they grew up. </p><p>BUT both Denton and Elizabeth being, as I have </p><p>explained, strange old-fashioned young people, </p><p>full of nineteenth-century ideas, hated these con- </p><p>venient crcchcs exceedingly and at last took their </p><p>little daughter to one with extreme reluctance. They </p><p>were received by a motherly person in a uniform who </p><p>was very brisk and prompt in her manner until </p><p>Elizabeth wept at the mention of parting from her </p><p>child. The motherly person, after a brief astonish- </p><p>ment at this unusual emotion, changed suddenly into </p><p>a creature of hope and comfort, and so won Eliza- </p><p>beth’s gratitude for life. They were conducted into </p><p>a vast room presided over by several nurses and with </p><p>hundreds of two-year-old girls grouped about the </p><p>toy-covered floor. This was the Two-year-old Room. </p><p>Two nurses came forward, and Elizabeth watched </p><p>their bearing towards Dings with jealous eyes. They </p><p>were kind—it was clear they felt kind, and yet . . . </p><p> Presently it was time to go. By that time Dings</p><p>was happily established in a corner, sitting on the </p><p>floor with her arms filled, and herself, indeed, for </p><p>the most part hidden by an unaccustomed wealth of </p><p>toys. She seemed careless of all human relation- </p><p>ships as her parents receded. </p><p> They were forbidden to upset her by saying</p><p>good-bye. </p><p> At the door Elizabeth glanced back for the last</p><p>time, and behold! Dings had dropped her new wealth </p><p>and was standing with a dubious face. Suddenly </p><p>Elizabeth gasped, and the motherly nurse pushed her </p><p>forward and closed the door. </p><p> “You can come again soon, dear,” she said, with</p><p>unexpected tenderness in her eyes. For a moment </p><p>Elizabeth stared at her with a blank face. “You can</p><p>come again soon,” repeated the nurse. Then with </p><p>a swift transition Elizabeth was weeping in the </p><p>nurse’s arms. So it was that Denton’s heart was </p><p>won also. </p><p> And three weeks after our young people were</p><p>absolutely penniless, and only one way lay open. </p><p>They must go to the Labor Company. So soon as </p><p>the rent was a week overdue their few remaining </p><p>possessions were seized, and with scant courtesy </p><p>they were shown the way out of the hotel. Eliza- </p><p>beth walked along the passage towards the staircase </p><p>that ascended to the motionless middle way, too </p><p>dulled by misery to think. Denton stopped behind </p><p>to finish a stinging and unsatisfactory argument with </p><p>the hotel porter, and then came hurrying after her, </p><p>flushed and hot. TTe slackened his pace as lie over- </p><p>took her, and together they ascended to the middle </p><p>way in silence. There they found two seats vacant </p><p>and sat down. </p><p> “We need not go there—yet?” said Elizabeth.</p><p> “No—not till we are hungry,” said Denton.</p><p> They said no more.</p><p> Elizabeth's eyes sought a resting-place and found</p><p>none. To the right roared the eastward ways, to the </p><p>left the ways in the opposite direction, swarming </p><p>with people. Backwards and forwards along a cable </p><p>overhead rushed a string of gesticulating meji, </p><p>dressed like clowns, each marked on back and chest </p><p>with one gigantic letter, so that altogether they spelt </p><p>out: </p><p>“Purkinje’s Digestive Pills” </p><p>An anaemic little woman in horrible coarse blue can- </p><p>vas pointed a little girl to one of this string of hurry- </p><p>ing advertisements. </p><p>22 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> “Look!” said the anamiic woman: “ther’s yer</p><p>father.” </p><p> “Which?” said the little girl.</p><p> “ Tm wiv his nose colored red." said the anaemic</p><p>woman. </p><p> The little girl began to cry, and Elizabeth could</p><p>have cried too. </p><p> “Ain't 'e kickin’ 'is legs!—just!’' said the anaemic</p><p>woman in blue, trying to make things bright again. </p><p>“Looky—now!” </p><p> On the facade to the right a huge intensely bright</p><p>disc of weird color span incessantly, and letters of </p><p>fire that came and went spelt out— </p><p>“Does this make you Giddy?” </p><p>Then a pause, followed by </p><p>“Take a Purkinje's Digestive Pill.” </p><p> A vast and desolating braying began. “If you love</p><p>Swagger Literature, put your telephone on to Drug- </p><p>gies. the Greatest Author of all Time. The Greatest </p><p>Thinker of all Time. Teaches you Morals up to </p><p>your Scalp! The very image of Socrates, except </p><p>the back of his head, which is like Shakespeare. He </p><p>has six toes, dresses in red, and never cleans his </p><p>teeth. Hear Him!” </p><p> Denton’s voice became audible in a gap in the</p><p>uproar. “I never ought to have married you,” he </p><p>was saying. “I have wasted your money, ruined you, </p><p>brought you to misery. I am a scoundrel . . . Oh, </p><p>this accursed world!” </p><p> She tried to speak, and for some moments could</p><p>not. She grasped his hand. “No,” she said at last. </p><p> A half-formed desire suddenly became determina-</p><p>tion. She stood up. “Will you come?” </p><p> He rose also. “We need not go there yet.”</p><p> “Not that. But I want you to come to the flying</p><p>stages—where we met. You know? The little seat.” </p><p>fie hesitated. “Caw you?” he said, doubtfully. </p><p>“Must,” she answered. </p><p> He hesitated still for a moment, then moved to</p><p>obey her will.</p><p> And so it was they spent their last half-day of</p><p>freedom out under the open air in the little seat </p><p>under the flying stages where they had been wont </p><p>to meet five short years ago. There she told him, </p><p>what she could not tell him in the tumultuous public </p><p>ways, that she did not repent even now of their mar- </p><p>riage—that whatever discomfort and misery life still </p><p>had for them, she was content with the things that </p><p>had been. The weather was kind to them, the seat </p><p>was sunlit and warm, and overhead the shining aero- </p><p>planes went and came. </p><p> At last towards sunsetting their time was at an</p><p>end, and they made their vows to one another and </p><p>clasped hands, and then rose up and went back into </p><p>the ways of the city, a shabby-looking, heavy-hearted </p><p>pair, tired and hungry. Soon they came to one of </p><p>the pale blue signs that marked a Labor Company </p><p>Bureau. For a space they stood in the middle way </p><p>regarding this and at last descended and entered the </p><p>waiting room. </p><p>THE Labor Company had originally been a char- </p><p>itable organization; its aim was to supply food, </p><p>shelter and work to all comers. This it was bound </p><p>to do by the conditions of its incorporation, and it </p><p>was also bound to supply food and shelter and medi- </p><p>cal attendance to all incapable of work who chose to </p><p>demand its aid. In exchange these incapables paid </p><p>labor notes, which they had to redeem upon recovery. </p><p>They signed these labor notes with thumb-marks, </p><p>which were photographed and indexed in such a </p><p>way that this world-wide Labor Company could </p><p>identify any one of its two or three hundred million </p><p>clients at the cost of an hour’s inquiry. The day's </p><p>labor was defined as two spells in a treadmill used </p><p>in generating electrical force, or its equivalent, and </p><p>its due performance could be enforced by law. In </p><p>practice the Labor Company found it advisable to </p><p>add to its statutory obligations ol food and shelter a </p><p>few pence a day as an inducement to effort; and its </p><p>enterprise had not only abolished pauperization alto- </p><p>gether, but supplied practically all but the very high- </p><p>est and most responsible labor throughout the world. </p><p>Nearly a third of the population of the world were </p><p>its serfs and debtors from the cradle to the grave. </p><p> In this practical, unsentimental way the problem</p><p>of the unemployed had been most satisfactorily met </p><p>and overcome. No one starved in the public ways, </p><p>and no rags, no costume less sanitary and sufficient </p><p>than the Labor Company’s hygienic but inelegant </p><p>blue canvas, pained the eye throughout the whole </p><p>world. It was the constant theme of the phono- </p><p>graphic newspapers how much the world had pro- </p><p>gressed since nineteenth-century days, when the</p><p>bodies of those killed by the vehicular traffic or dead </p><p>of starvation were, they alleged, a common feature </p><p>in all the busier streets. </p><p> Denton and Elizabeth sat apart in the waiting</p><p>room until their turn came. Most of the others </p><p>collccted there seemed limp and taciturn, but three </p><p>or four young people gaudily dressed made up for </p><p>the quietude of their companions. They were life </p><p>clients of the Company, born in the Company’s </p><p>creclie and destined to die in its hospital, and they </p><p>had been out for a spree with some shillings or so of </p><p>extra pay. They talked vociferously in a later devel- </p><p>opment of the Cockney dialect, manifestly very </p><p>proud of themselves. </p><p> Elizabeth’s eyes went from these to the less assert-</p><p>ive figures. One seemed exceptionally pitiful to </p><p>her. It was a woman of perhaps forty-five, with </p><p>gold-stained hair and a painted face, down which </p><p>abundant tears had trickled; she had a pinched nose, </p><p>hungry eyes, lean hands and shoulders, and her </p><p>dusty worn-out finery told the story of her life. </p><p>Another was a grey-bearded old man in the costume </p><p>of a bishop of one of the high episcopal sects—for </p><p>religion was now also a business, and had its ups </p><p>and downs. And beside him a sickly, dissipated-look- </p><p>ing boy of perhaps two-and-twenty glared at Fate. </p><p> Presently Elizabeth and then Denton interviewed</p><p>the manageress—for the Company preferred women </p><p>in this capacity—and found she possessed an ener- </p><p>getic face, a contemptuous manner, and a particu- </p><p>larly unpleasant voice. They were given various </p><p>checks, including one to certify that they need not </p><p>have their heads cropped; and when they had given </p><p>their thumb-marks, learnt the number corresponding </p><p>thereunto, and exchanged their shabby middle-class </p><p>clothes for duly numbered blue canvas suits, they </p><p>repaired to the huge plain dining-room for their </p><p>first meal under these new conditions. Afterwards </p><p>they were to return to her for instructions about </p><p>their work. </p><p> When they had made the exchange of their cloth-</p><p>ing Elizabeth did not seem able to look at Denton at </p><p>first; but he looked at her, and saw with astonish- </p><p>ment that even in blue canvas she was still beautiful. </p><p>A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME </p><p>23 </p><p>And then their soup and bread came sliding on its </p><p>little rail down the long table towards them and </p><p>stopped with a jerk, and he forgot the matter. For </p><p>they had had no proper meal for three days. </p><p> After they had dined they rested for a time.</p><p>Neither talked—there was nothing to say; and pres- </p><p>ently they got up and went back to the manageress </p><p>to learn what they had to do. </p><p> The manageress referred to a tablet. “Y'r rooms</p><p>won't be here; it'll be in the Highbury Ward, ninety- </p><p>seventh way, number two thousand and seventeen. </p><p>Better make a note of it on y'r card. You, nought </p><p>nought nought, type seven, sixty-four, b.c.d., gamma </p><p>forty-one, female: you 'ave got to go to the Metal- </p><p>beating Company and try that for a day—fourpence </p><p>bonus if ye’re satisfactory; and you, nought seven </p><p>one, type four, seven hundred and nine, g.f.b., pi </p><p>five and ninety, male; you ’ave to go to the Photo- </p><p>graphic Company 011 Eighty-first way, and learn </p><p>something or other — / don’t know — thrippence. </p><p>’Ere’s y’r cards. That’s all. Next! What? Didn't </p><p>catch it all? Lor! So suppose I must go over it all </p><p>again. W hy don't you listen? Keerless, improvi- </p><p>dent people! One’d think these things didn’t matter.” </p><p>THEIR ways to their work lay together for a </p><p>time. And now they found they could talk. </p><p>Curiously enough, the worst of their depression </p><p>seemed over now that they had actually donned the </p><p>blue. Denton could talk with interest even of the </p><p>work that lay before them. “Whatever it is,” he </p><p>said, “it can’t be so hateful as that hat shop. And </p><p>after we have paid for Dings we shall still have a </p><p>whole penny a day between us even now. After- </p><p>wards—we may improve—get more money.” </p><p> Elizabeth was less inclined to speech. “I wonder</p><p>why work should seem so hateful,” she said. </p><p> “It’s odd,” said Denton. “I suppose it wouldn’t</p><p>be if it were not the thought of being ordered about </p><p>. . . I hope w^shall have decent managers.” </p><p> Elizabeth did not answer. She was not thinking</p><p>of that. She was tracing out some thoughts of her </p><p>own. </p><p> “Of course." she said presently, “we have been</p><p>using up work all our lives. It's only fair—” </p><p> She stopped. It was too intricate.</p><p> “We paid for it.” said Denton, for at that time</p><p>he had not troubled himself about these complicated </p><p>things. </p><p> “We did nothing—and yet we paid for it. That’s</p><p>what I cannot understand.” </p><p> “Perhaps we are paying,” said Elizabeth pres-</p><p>ently—for her theology was old-fashioned and </p><p>simple. </p><p> Presently it was time for them to part, and each</p><p>went to the appointed work. Denton’s was to mind </p><p>a complicated hydraulic press that seemed almost an </p><p>intelligent thing. This press worked by the sea- </p><p>water that was destined finally to flush the city </p><p>drains—for the world had long since abandoned the </p><p>folly of pouring drinkable water into its sewers. </p><p>This water was brought close to the eastward edge of </p><p>the city by a huge canal, and then raised by an </p><p>enormous battery of pupips into reservoirs at a level </p><p>of four hundred feet above the sea, from which it </p><p>spread by a billion arterial branches over the city. </p><p>Thence it poured down, cleansing, sluicing, working </p><p>machinery of all sorts, through an infinite variety </p><p>of capillary channels into the great drains, the </p><p>cloacae maximae,* and so carried the sewage out to </p><p>the agricultural areas that surrounded London on </p><p>every side. </p><p> The press was employed in one of the processes</p><p>of the photographic manufacture, but the nature of </p><p>the process it did not concern Denton to understand. </p><p>The most salient fact to his mind was that it had to </p><p>be conducted in ruby light, and as a consequence the </p><p>room in which he worked was lit by one colored </p><p>globe that poured a lurid and painful illumination </p><p>about the room. In the darkest corner stood the </p><p>press whose servant Denton had now become: it was </p><p>a huge, dim. glittering thing with a projecting hood </p><p>that had a remote resemblance to a bowed head, and, </p><p>squatting like some metal Buddha in this weird light </p><p>that ministered to its needs, it seemed to Denton in </p><p>certain moods almost as if this must needs be the </p><p>obscure idol to which humanity in some strange </p><p>aberration had offered up his life. His duties had </p><p>a varied monotony. Such items as the following will </p><p>convey an idea of the service of the press. The </p><p>thing worked with a busy clicking so long as things </p><p>went well; but if the paste that came pouring through </p><p>a feeder from another room and which it was per- </p><p>petually compressing into thin plates, changed in </p><p>quality, the rhythm of its click altered and Denton </p><p>hastened to make certain adjustments. The slightest </p><p>delay involved a waste of paste and the docking of </p><p>one or more of his daily pence. If the supply of </p><p>paste waned—there were hand processes of a peculiar </p><p>sort involved in its preparation, and sometimes the</p><p>workers had convulsions which deranged their out- </p><p>put—Denton had to throw the press out of gear. In </p><p>the painful vigilance a multitude of such trivial </p><p>attentions entailed, painful because of the incessant </p><p>effort its absence of natural interest required, Denton </p><p>had now to pass one-third of his days. Save for an </p><p>occasional visit from the manager, a kindly but </p><p>singularly foul-mouthed man, Denton passed his </p><p>working hours in solitude. </p><p> Elizabeth’s work was of a more social sort. There</p><p>was a fashion for covering the private apartments </p><p>of the very wealthy with metal plates beautifully </p><p>embossed with repeated patterns. The taste of the </p><p>time demanded, however, that the repetition of the </p><p>patterns should not be exact—not mechanical, but </p><p>“natural”—and it was found that the most pleasing </p><p>arrangement of pattern irregularity was obtained by </p><p>employing women of refinement and natural taste </p><p>to punch out the patterns with small dies. So many </p><p>square feet of plates was exacted from Elizabeth as </p><p>a minimum, and for whatever square feet she did in </p><p>excess she received a small payment. The room, like </p><p>most rooms of women workers, was under fx man- </p><p>ageress : men had been found by the Labor Company </p><p>not only less exacting but extremely liable to excuse </p><p>favored ladies from a proper share of their duties. </p><p>The manageress was a not unkindly, taciturn person, </p><p>with the hardened remains of beauty of the brunette </p><p>type; and the other women workers, who of course </p><p>hated her. associated her name scandalously with one </p><p>of the metal-work directors in order to explain her </p><p>position. </p><p> Only two or three of Elizabeth’s fellovv-workers</p><p>were born labor serfs; plain, morose girls, but most </p><p>of them corresponded to what the nineteenth century </p><p>would have called a “reduced” gentlewoman. But </p><p>the ideal of what constituted a gentlewoman had </p><p> •Principal or largest sewers.</p><p>24 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>altered: the faint, faded, negative virtue, the modu- </p><p>lated voice and restrained gesture of the old-fash- </p><p>ioned gentlewoman had vanished from the earth. </p><p>Most of her companions showed in discolored hair, </p><p>ruined complexions, and the texture of their reminis- </p><p>cent conversations, the vanished glories of a con- </p><p>quering youth. All of these artistic workers were </p><p>much older than Elizabeth, and two openly expressed </p><p>their surprise that any one so young and pleasant </p><p>should come to share their toil. But Elizabeth did </p><p>not trouble them with her old-world moral con- </p><p>ceptions. </p><p>THEY were permitted, and even encouraged to </p><p>converse with each other, for the directors very </p><p>properly judged that anything that conduced to vari- </p><p>ations of mood made for pleasing fluctuations in </p><p>their patterning; and Elizabeth was almost forced </p><p>to hear the stories of these lives with which her own </p><p>interwove: garbled and distorted they were by van- </p><p>ity indeed and yet comprehensible enough. And </p><p>soOn she began to appreciate the small spites and </p><p>cliques, the little misunderstandings and alliances </p><p>that enmeshed about her. One woman was exces- </p><p>sively garrulous and descriptive about a wonderful </p><p>son of hers; another had cultivated a foolish coarse- </p><p>ness of speech, that she seemed to regard as the </p><p>wittiest expression of originality conceivable; a third </p><p>mused for ever on dress, and whispered tojilizabeth </p><p>how she saved her pence day after day, JTnd would </p><p>presently have a glorious day of freedom, wearing </p><p>. . . and then followed hours of description; two </p><p>others sat always together, and called one another </p><p>pet names, until one day some little thing happened, </p><p>and they sat apart, blind and deaf as it seemed to </p><p>one another’s being. And always from them all came </p><p>an incessant tap. tap, tap, tap, and the manageress </p><p>listened always to the rhythm to mark if one fell </p><p>away. Tap, tap, tap, tap: so their days passed, so </p><p>their lives must pass. Elizabeth sat among them, </p><p>kindly and quiet, gray-hearted, marveling at Fate: </p><p>tap, tap, tap; tap, tap, tap; tap, tap, tap. </p><p> So there came to Denton and Elizabeth a long</p><p>succession of laborious days, that hardened their </p><p>hands, wove strange threads of some new and sterner </p><p>substance into the soft prettiness of their lives,\nd </p><p>drew grave lines and shadows on their faces. The </p><p>bright, convenient ways of the former life had re- </p><p>ceded to an inaccessible distance; slowly they learnt </p><p>the lesson of the under-world—sombre and labori- </p><p>ous, vast and pregnant. There were many little </p><p>things happened : things that would be tedious and </p><p>miserable to tell, things that were bitter and grievous </p><p>to bear—indignities, tyrannies, such as must ever</p><p>season the bread of the poor in cities; and one thing </p><p>that was not little, but seemed like the utter blacken- </p><p>ing of life to them, which was that the child they </p><p>had given life to sickened and died. But that story, </p><p>that ancient, perpetually recurring story, has been </p><p>told so often, has been told so beautifully, that there </p><p>is no need to tell it over again here. There was the </p><p>same sharp fear, the same long anxiety, the deferred </p><p>inevitable blow, and the black silence. It has always </p><p>been the same; it will always be the same. It is one </p><p>of the things that must be. </p><p> And it was Elizabeth who was the first to speak,</p><p>after an aching, dull interspace of days: not, indeed, </p><p>of the foolish little name that was a name no longer, </p><p>but of the darkness that brooded over her soul. They </p><p>had come through the shrieking, tumultuous ways </p><p>of the city together; the clamor of trade, of yelling </p><p>competitive religions, of political appeal, had beat </p><p>upon deaf ears; the glare of focussed lights, of </p><p>dancing letters, and fiery advertisements, had fallen </p><p>upon the set, miserable faces unheeded. They took </p><p>their dinner in the dining-hall at a place apart. "I </p><p>want,” said Elizabeth clumsily, “to go out to the </p><p>flying stages—to that seat. Here, one can say </p><p>nothing. . . .” </p><p> Denton looked at her. “It will be night.” he said.</p><p>“I have asked,—it is a fine night.” She stopped. </p><p>He perceived she could find no words to explain </p><p>herself. Suddenly he understood that she wished to </p><p>see the stars once more, the stars they had watched </p><p>together from the open downland in that wild honey- </p><p>moon of theirs five years ago. Something caught at </p><p>his throat. He looked away from her. </p><p> “There will be plenty of time to go,” he said, in a</p><p>matter-of-fact tone. </p><p> And at last they came out to their little seat on</p><p>the flying stage, and sat there for a long time in </p><p>silence. The little seat was in shadow, but the zenith </p><p>was pale blue with the effulgence of the stage over- </p><p>head, and all the city spread below them, squares </p><p>and circles and patches of brilliance caught in a </p><p>mesh-work of light. The little stars seemed very </p><p>faint and small: near as they had been to the old- </p><p>world watcher, they had become now infinitely re- </p><p>mote. Yet one could see them in the darkened </p><p>patches amidst the glare, and especially in the north- </p><p>ward sky, the ancient constellations gliding steadfast </p><p>and patient about the pole. </p><p> Long our two people sat in silence, and at last</p><p>Elizabeth sighed. </p><p> “If I understood,” she said, “if I could under-</p><p>stand. When one is down there the city seems </p><p>everything—the noise, the hurry, the voices—you </p><p>must live, you must scramble. Here—it is nothing; </p><p>a thing that passes. One can think in peace.” </p><p>“Yes,” said Denton. “How flimsy it all is! From </p><p>here more than half of it is swallowed by the night. </p><p>... It will pass.” </p><p> “We shall pass first,” said Elizabeth.</p><p> “I know,” said Denton. “If life were not a mo-</p><p>ment, the whole of history would seem like the </p><p>happening of a day ... Yes—we shall pass. And the </p><p>city will pass, and all the things that are to come. </p><p>Man and the Overman and wonders unspeakable. </p><p>And yet . . .” </p><p> He paused, and then began afresh. “I know what</p><p>you feel. At least I fancy ... Down there one thinks </p><p>of one’s work, one’s little vexations and pleasures, </p><p>one’s eating and drinking and ease and pain. One </p><p>lives, and one must die. Down there and everyday </p><p>—our sorrow seemed the end of life. . . . </p><p> “Up here it is different. For instance, down there</p><p>it would seem impossible almost to go on living if </p><p>one were horribly disfigured, horribly crippled, dis- </p><p>graced. Up here—under these stars—none of those </p><p>things would matter. They don’t matter. . . . They </p><p>are a part of something. One seems just to touch </p><p>that something—under the stars. . . .” </p><p> He stopped. The vague, impalpable things in his</p><p>mind, cloudy emotions half shaped towards ideas, </p><p>vanished before the rough grasp of words. “It is </p><p>hard to express,” he said lamely. </p><p> They sat through a long stillness.</p><p> "It is well to come here.” he said at last. “We</p><p>stop—our minds are very finite. After all we are </p><p>just poor animals rising out of the brute, each with </p><p>A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME </p><p>25 </p><p>a mind, the poor beginning of a mind. We are so </p><p>stupid. So much hurts. And yet .. </p><p> "I know, I know—and some day we shall see.</p><p> "All this frightful stress, all this discord will re-</p><p>solve to harmony, and we shall know it. Nothing is </p><p>but it makes for that. Nothing. All the failures— </p><p>every little thing makes for that harmony. Every- </p><p>thing is necessary to it, we shall find. We shall find. </p><p>Nothing, not even the most dreadful thing, could be </p><p>left out. Not even the most trivial. Every tap of </p><p>your hammer on the brass, every moment of work, </p><p>my idleness even . . . Dear one! every movement of </p><p>our poor little one ... All these things go on for ever. </p><p>And the faint impalpable things. We, sitting here </p><p>together.—Everything . . . </p><p> “The passion that joined us, and what has come</p><p>since. It is not passion now. More than anything </p><p>else it is sorrow. Dear . . </p><p> He could say no more, could follow his thoughts</p><p>no further. </p><p> Elizabeth made no answer—she was very still;</p><p>but presently her hand sought his and found it. </p><p> (End of Part I. )</p><p>The Fallacy in “Ten Million Miles Sunward” </p><p> By PROF. W. J. LUYTEN</p><p> of Harvard College Observatory, Cambridge, Mass.</p><p> It is with a feeling of gratification that we publish for the benefit of our readers, the interesting note</p><p> from Professor Luyten, pointing out the fallacy in the story, “TEN MILLION MILES SUNWARD.” A</p><p> force coming from the outside is essential to change the earth's orbit, and it will be observed that the</p><p> energy involved in a tremendous rapidity of flow of water into the Caspian Sea, or the discharge of some</p><p> Inconceivably great projectile would bring to bear a force from the outside. We naturally cannot and do</p><p> not wish to add anything to Professor Luyten’s very clear and comprehensive statement.</p><p> In connection with the idea of discharging projectiles, we may refer to Jules Vern’s story, “The Pur-</p><p> chase of the North Pole,” in our issues of September and October, 1926. Here, in order to shift the North</p><p> Pole, Jules Verne's scientists discharge an enormous projectile into space, in exact accordance with Pro-</p><p> fessor Luyten's statement. Jules Verne' in his story, however, assumed that the people of his tale merely</p><p> desired to shift the North Pole toward the Temperate Zone, and not to divert the earth from its orbir.</p><p>ASTRONOMICALLY speaking, the </p><p>thing is totally unsound; it is en- </p><p>tirely impossible to change the course of </p><p>the earth (I mean in its path around the </p><p>sun) by doing anything from the earth </p><p>itself. To change the earth’s orbit would </p><p>require a force coining from the outside. </p><p>At the most, we could do a little toward </p><p>it by breaking the earth in two, then the </p><p>two bits might very well pursue another </p><p>orbit. The fundamental law of mechan- </p><p>ics is that the centre of gravity of the </p><p>earth will remain in its orbit so long; as </p><p>only interior forces act, and in the case </p><p>of the Caspian adventure we are dealing </p><p>with a purely interior force. Besides, </p><p>the shifting of the centre of gravity on </p><p>its account would he very small. </p><p> If the water flowed from the Black</p><p>Sea into the Caspian at a tremendous </p><p>rate of speed, it might for the time being </p><p>slow down the rotation of the earth a </p><p>little and make the day a few seconds </p><p>longer, but would have no further effect. </p><p>After the Caspian had been filled up the </p><p>rotation would come back to practically </p><p>the same value it had before. Also, in </p><p>such a case, if the earth swerved at all </p><p>from its course, it would do that gradu- </p><p>ally, and not suddenly. </p><p> If we were really in the predicament</p><p>proposed by the author of “Ten Million </p><p>Miles Sunward” our only salvation would </p><p>lie in shooting off enormous projectiles </p><p>in the direction opposite to the way we </p><p>wanted to go. This is essentially a force </p><p>from the outside. </p><p> Concerning the Black Sea-Caspian con-</p><p>nection it might he of interest to know </p><p>that there is a canal between the rivers </p><p>Don and Volga, thereby connecting these </p><p>two seas. At least so I was told when I </p><p>was in Russia last summer. I do not </p><p>think however that the thing is 011 any </p><p>large scale and probably too high up to </p><p>fill the Caspian with Black Sea water. </p><p>^ yeast men </p><p> hyD&amp;Oid H. Keller M.D.</p><p>Author of “The Revolt of the Pedestrians” </p><p>NLESS the unexpected happened, Mo- </p><p>ronia would l&gt;e destroyed. The last war </p><p>had destroyed many of her young men, </p><p>ruined her finances and deprived her </p><p>people of even a hope for better years to </p><p>come. The kingdom of Eupcnia now completely </p><p>surrounded Moronia, shutting off on all sides her </p><p>commerce and intercourse with friendly nations. </p><p>The next war would end the struggle and strife that </p><p>had lasted for centuries. </p><p> Like a previous conqueror. Premier Plautz arose</p><p>day after day in the Eupenian Senate to croak out </p><p>his celebrated, quadruple-worded threat—a threat </p><p>that he hoped some day would 1&gt;e fulfilled prophecy. </p><p>“Moronia must l&gt;e destroyed!” he cried, and the </p><p>Eupenians, drunk with success and power, answered </p><p>with renewed plaudits and increased appropriations </p><p>for the final struggle. “Moronia must be destroyed!” </p><p>he said on the 1st of September, 19—. “She lies in </p><p>the middle of our fair country, like a dreaded and </p><p>threatening cancer. We have cut off her commerce </p><p>and bled her manpower white. Now is the time to </p><p>destroy her. and occupy her farms and cities with our </p><p>own deserving populace. Moronia must be destroyed! </p><p>Our army hopes to occupy her capital by Christmas </p><p>Day. After such a victory we will have good reason </p><p>to celebrate the Birthday of our Master. From that </p><p>day on the word Moronia will only be a memory and </p><p>a warning—a memory of </p><p>our power and a warning </p><p>to any future enemy. Mo- </p><p>ronia must be destroyed! </p><p>Moronia shall be de- </p><p>stroyed !!” </p><p> Immediately after this</p><p>short address the Senate </p><p>adjourned. T h e W a r </p><p>Council met that after- </p><p>noon to perfect plans for </p><p>the next war, as yet unde- </p><p>clared. Just as he did in </p><p>the Senate, Premier Plautz </p><p>dominated this body. At </p><p>once he asked the Chief of </p><p>the Air Service if his corps was prepared for war. </p><p> "We are. Your Excellency!” was the unexpected</p><p>reply from Colonel Von Dort. “We are prepared for </p><p>war. but we are also prepared for more than the at-</p><p>tack. I have in readiness one thousand planes, each </p><p>manned by two experienced aviators. At your com- </p><p>mand, the air service will begin the assault, but T </p><p>warn you in advance that we will lose one thousand </p><p>planes and two thousand men at the first attack. We </p><p>are prepared—for Death!” </p><p> “That is the speech of a coward. Are all of the</p><p>corps like you ?” demanded Premier Plautz. “I am </p><p>informed the Moronians have only a few air craft. </p><p>Of what arc you afraid?” </p><p> “We fear nothing,” replied Von Dort, white with</p><p>suppressed anger, “but we know the truth. Since the </p><p>last war, Moronia has perfected some kind of a light- </p><p>ray. A machine is placed every mile along their en- </p><p>tire border. From these machines the rays go out. </p><p>presumably in a fan shape. When the ray'strikes an </p><p>airplane, the engine not only stops but apparently </p><p>explodes. No one knows how high in the air these </p><p>rays go—we have never been able to rise above the </p><p>range of their power. We have been experimenting </p><p>and have found no way of defending the plane </p><p>against the ray. So far, twenty of our planes, dis- </p><p>guised as commercial machines, have been destroyed </p><p>and our aviators killed. In every instance the bodies </p><p>were brought to the frontier by the Moronians. and </p><p>each time they have simply explained that something </p><p>went wrong with the machinery and the plane </p><p>dropped in their country. We have every reason to </p><p>believe that they have perfected some power which </p><p>will render impossible any attack on the enemy by </p><p>air. What happened to twenty planes will hapj&gt;en to </p><p>a thousand. That is why I said my corps was pre- </p><p>pared for death.” </p><p> The Premier started to pound the table with his</p><p>fist, “Why was I not informed of this? What has </p><p>been done to protect our </p><p>machines ? The destruction </p><p>of one plane w?* enough </p><p>to justify a new war. </p><p>What have you been doing </p><p>besides skulking in </p><p>cowardice?” </p><p> “I made daily reports to</p><p>the Chief of Staff,” re- </p><p>torted Von Dort. ‘The en- </p><p>tire matter is on record. </p><p>For a month our Depart- </p><p>ment of Physics and </p><p>Chemistry has been work- </p><p>ing on this problem. They </p><p>thought they had a satis- </p><p>factory defense, and the last ten planes were sup- </p><p>posed to have been protected, but they crumpled like</p><p>the first ten.” </p><p> “Colonel Von Dort is right.” interrupted the Chief</p><p>of Staff. General Hurlung. “All reports have been </p><p>filed regularly, and a dailv summary lias been sent to </p><p>your office. After all. it is a purely military problem. </p><p>We still have the other arms of the service, the cal- </p><p>vary, artillery and infantry. With our calvary alone, </p><p>we could overrun Moronia. We need not worry </p><p>about the air service.” </p><p> 'yrOU have, of course, read Dr. Keller's story, “The</p><p> 1 Revolt of the Pedestrians," which we printed in the</p><p> February issue. Literally thousands of letters were re-</p><p> ceived by us commenting upon this unusual story. This</p><p> month Dr. Keller comes to the fore aoaiit with a tale</p><p> which will range easily as one of the best scientifiction</p><p> stones of 1028. For sheer originality, daring of thought</p><p> and uniqueness. this story is outstanding. It contains good</p><p> science, for the Yeast Men actually could perform all the</p><p> things that Dr. Keller so vividly portrays here.</p><p> Modern Uxirfart is very much as is described by this in-</p><p> teresting author. Gas has been introduced only during the</p><p> last war. and we may be surf that situations such as Dr.</p><p> Keller depicts will come about soon enough.</p><p>26 </p><p>The whole resistance was hopeless. The Yeast Men arrived day after day in increasing numbers and they could not be killed. They </p><p>could be mutilated, dissevered, decapitated, but each piece lived and moved onwards . . . What use cutting a thing to pieces when each </p><p>piece kept on living and advancing? How could an enemy be killed when it could not bleed? </p><p> 27</p><p>28 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> “Oh! I suppose so. I suppose so!” replied the</p><p>Premier, petulantly. “Still I wanted to blow them </p><p>into hell with air bombs—all of them, men, women </p><p>and children.” </p><p> “But if you did that you would also destroy prop-</p><p>erty,” argued General Hurlung. “The infantry can </p><p>wipe- out the population just as effectively without </p><p>the loss of a single structure. What worries me is </p><p>this: They have a powerful ray of some kind which </p><p>we know can destroy a plane at ten thousand feet. </p><p>Suppose they turn these rays sidewise on our advanc- </p><p>ing army? What will happen?” </p><p> “Bah! You are growing old, General,” sneered</p><p>the Premier. “Have we not the artillery to blast our </p><p>way through such infernal machines? Our infantry </p><p>are men, not machines. They can live through any </p><p>kind of hell-fire and win the victory. I am fretted </p><p>at the atmosphere of doubt that covers this council of </p><p>war. We will attack on the first of October, open- </p><p>ing with artillery, following with calvary, and mop- </p><p>ping up with the infantry. These machines you </p><p>dread so much are only machines, and all machines </p><p>must be run by men. Kill the men and the machines </p><p>are harmless. General Hurlung, you will prepare </p><p>all branches of the army for the attack. Colonel </p><p>Von Dort, you are dismissed from the service for </p><p>cowardice. Go where you please, but if you are in </p><p>Eupenia at the end of two days, I will have you </p><p>shot.” </p><p> Von Dort, drawing his dress sword, broke it over</p><p>his knee and threw the pieces on the table in front of </p><p>the Premier. Said Von Dort, “A country that thus </p><p>rewards honesty is a land rotten to the core.” The </p><p>men around the table kept an awkward silence as he </p><p>left the room. </p><p> Premier Plautz stood up. “You gentlemen know</p><p>what to do. I will accept no excuses for incompe- </p><p>tency. Moronia must be destroyed. We will meet </p><p>again a week from today. The Secret Service had </p><p>better follow Von Dort and imprison him. I do not </p><p>trust him. Keep him in solitary confinement and I </p><p>will deal finally with him in a few days.” </p><p> Von Dort, however, was already in his automobile,</p><p>leaving Eupenia as fast as he could. He paused at </p><p>his home only long enough to almost throw his wife </p><p>and baby and a few valuables into his car; then he </p><p>started for Moronia at seventy miles an hour. Von </p><p>Dort was thoroughly mad. For ten years he had </p><p>served in the air service of Eupenia, advancing slowly </p><p>from mechanician to Chief of the Service. During</p><p>that time he had done his best. Under his leadership </p><p>the corps had achieved the finest type of morale. He </p><p>knew that his men were always ready to gamble on a </p><p>chance in war, but he could not sit still and see his </p><p>entire force sent to what he felt was certain death. </p><p>During his ten years of military service he had had </p><p>ample chance to study the Premier. He knew that </p><p>every man who had dared to oppose Plautz had come </p><p>to an unfortunate end, disgrace, exile or death. Life </p><p>to Von Dort. with his wife and baby was too sweet </p><p>to be sacrificed unless absolutely necessary. The for- </p><p>mer Chief of the Air Service fully realized all this. </p><p>He increased the speed of his car. Moronia was his </p><p>destination for other reasons than because it was the </p><p>nearest border. He felt that he could trust them, as </p><p>enemies, more than he could trust the other nation? </p><p>who were friendly to Eupenia. Also, his wife had </p><p>come from that nation. She was the daughter of a </p><p>former Moronian general, who died in the last wrar. </p><p>Von Dort had been a mem!&gt;er of the army of occupa- </p><p>tion, and once having met this particular young lady, </p><p>all his loyalty to Eupenia was insufficient to prevent </p><p>him from falling in love. He felt that if he had to </p><p>die, it would be better to die with his wife and baby </p><p>in the mountains of Moronia, than in solitude in an </p><p>Eupenian prison. </p><p>THE radio message beat them to the frontier, and </p><p>Von Dort saw that the barricade had been low- </p><p>ered. It was a sturdy wooden gate, but the automo- </p><p>bile hit it going eighty miles an hour and reduced it </p><p>to kindling. The car finally stopped, rather dis- </p><p>heveled in looks but with the motor still running, one </p><p>mile inside Moronia. There Von Dort stopped as </p><p>soon as possible, having a deep respect for the vigi- </p><p>lance and accurate shooting of the Moronia border </p><p>patrol. He did not wish to arouse their suspicion in </p><p>any way. The car was soon surrounded by cavalry- </p><p>men, who politely but firmly asked for full details as </p><p>to his identity and reason for entering the country in </p><p>such a precipitous manner. Realizing that there w'as </p><p>no reason for deceit, he gave them a brief account of </p><p>his trouble and asked to be taken to the General-in- </p><p>Chief of the Moronian army. </p><p> Moronia, nominally a monarchy, was in every re-</p><p>spect democratic, except that it had a King. Every </p><p>citizen felt an equal amount of reverence and fra- </p><p>ternity for this monarch. There was rank, both in </p><p>civil and military life, but promotion was by merit </p><p>and without either syncophancy or tyranny. Conse- </p><p>quently it was easier to see the Commanding Gen- </p><p>eral in Moronia than it was to see the Third Assist- </p><p>ant Secretary of Agriculture in Eupenia. The Mo- </p><p>ronians lived among the mountains, and like the </p><p>eagles of the crags, prized their liberty. In conse- </p><p>quence of all this it was only a few hours before Von</p><p>Dort was telling his story to General Androvitz and </p><p>his staff. </p><p> They believed all that he said. Especially did they</p><p>believe him after his wife talked to them in their </p><p>native patois. There were some present who had </p><p>known her father well. One old officer was even able </p><p>to remember the celebration of her christening. The </p><p>general discussion was finally ended by Von Dort. </p><p> “I fled because I knew that Premier Plautz in-</p><p>tended to have me killed, and I came here because of </p><p>my wife and because I felt keenly the injustice of </p><p>another war. Moronia is to lie destroyed for no </p><p>other reason than selfishness and greed. The force </p><p>against you is overwhelming. I see nothing save </p><p>/our final and complete destruction. I f I have to die </p><p>[ want to die fighting rather than die in a prison, or </p><p>shot, or hanged like a criminal. I offer you my serv- </p><p>ices, General Androvitz. and am willing to serve your </p><p>country in any capacity.” </p><p> The General at once sent for the King to join their</p><p>deliberations. Rudolph Hubelaire came, a little, </p><p>withered, one-armed man with the fire of a lion in </p><p>his eye. He heard the news without changing ex- </p><p>pression. The other men watched him anxiously. </p><p>Finally he spoke. </p><p> “We can die hut once. Resistance, in our weak-</p><p>ened state, will be but a grand gesture. Eupenia may </p><p>conquer the country but she will never enslave our </p><p>patriots. They and their families may die, but they </p><p>will never surrender. When the time comes, we will </p><p>fight. When that is over, the survivors will retire to </p><p>our mountain forts. There we will live with the </p><p>THE YEAST MEN </p><p>2? </p><p>goats and chamois. I am sorry that it all has to end </p><p>thus, hut we have done our best. One more inven- </p><p>tion like our ultra-light rays would have saved us— </p><p>but our scientists have done their best, and as we </p><p>have failed, so have they. Colonel Von Dort, we </p><p>trust your honesty and welcome you to our ranks. </p><p>Your desire to die on the field of battle will probably </p><p>be realized." </p><p> The meeting was just breaking up, each participant</p><p>ready to carry the sad news to his friends, when the </p><p>guard at the door announced the presence of Mr. </p><p>Billings, one of Monrovia’s staff of scientific investi- </p><p>gators. </p><p> “Poor Billings,” said the King, “a harmless fellow</p><p>from America. He has worked in our laboratory for </p><p>years without pay except for his bare expenses, and </p><p>he is about broken-hearted because so far he has </p><p>failed to make any discovery of importance. I wish </p><p>we could get him back to America before war begins. </p><p>Let us humor the old gentleman and listen to his </p><p>story. I want you to show his age the proper respect. </p><p>Let there be no levity. His loyalty and faithful en- </p><p>deavor demand our greatest courtesy.” </p><p> Billings came in and was seated by the King. He</p><p>was stooped-shouldered, bald and trembling. His </p><p>high-pitched voice cracked like 'static under his ex- </p><p>citement. </p><p> “Your Majesty and Gentlemen,” he said. “After</p><p>years of the most tedious experimentation, I have </p><p>finally discovered a method of defending ourselves </p><p>against the Eupenians.” </p><p> "Fine!” said the King. “Now tell us all about it.”</p><p>“I propose that we make an army of Yeast Men.” </p><p>“That is a fine idea, Mr. Billings,” said the King </p><p>soothingly. “I am sure that your discovery has </p><p>merit. Now I want you to go over to America and </p><p>take a long vacation, and after you are thoroughly </p><p>rested you can come back and visit us again.” </p><p> “But you do not understand,” pleaded the old man.</p><p>“I suppose you think that I am senile. The inven- </p><p>tion is complete and I am sure it will work. It is </p><p>practical and simple. The one machine I have made </p><p>functions perfectly. It can easily be duplicated, and </p><p>anyone can run it. All we need is an abundance of </p><p>yeast and hundreds of machines. You shoot the lit- </p><p>tle fellows out like bullets from a machine gun.” </p><p>“Well, what happens then?” asked General Andro- </p><p>vitz. </p><p> “They just grow and walk around a little and then</p><p>they die.” </p><p> “If they do that they will be typical soldiers,” in-</p><p>terrupted the Chief of the Artillery Service. “That </p><p>is about all we will do between now and Christmas.” </p><p>"But in dying they will win the victory!” eagerly </p><p>chirped the inventor in his high-pitched cricket </p><p>voice.” Cannot you understand that they will die </p><p>and rot in Eupenia?” </p><p> The King gently took the old man by the shoulder</p><p>and as he talked the tears came to his eyes. </p><p> Y dear Billings. The thing you describe is</p><p>lVl just a soldier. For hundreds of years the </p><p>Moronians have died in defense of their country. </p><p>They had died and rotted, and yet we, as a nation, </p><p>have slowly withered away. Brave men by the thou- </p><p>sand have done just that, and to what avail? Your </p><p>eagerness to help has worried you sick. Go and take </p><p>a long rest. Yeast Men and real men may die and rot </p><p>but our dear Moronia is doomed.” </p><p>"But cannot you see it?” pleaded the inventor. </p><p>“Oh! Please try to see it. Yeast Men by the mil- </p><p>lions and billions walking into Eupenia and rotting </p><p>there. Cannot you see how it is going to work ?” </p><p> “I beg your pardon,” asked General Androvitz,</p><p> “but did you say billions?”</p><p> “I did. A few drops of yeast grows to be a soldier</p><p> six feet tall. Give me as many machines as those you</p><p> made to generate the anti-aircraft rays and I will</p><p> produce Yeast Men by the million. I will make a</p><p> million every day as long as it is necessary.”</p><p> “And they live just so long and then die?” asked</p><p> the King.</p><p> “Yes, they live about three days. During that time</p><p> they are able to move about twenty-five miles. Then</p><p> they die and rot.”</p><p> “A fairy tale,” said the Premier, who, up to this</p><p> time, had kept silent.</p><p> “But I can prove it. I have made one. If you see</p><p> just one of them, will you believe it? Let me show</p><p> you just one!”</p><p> The King held up his hand for silence.</p><p> “Gentlemen, let me talk to Billings. Please do not</p><p> interrupt. He is nervous—and so am I. We must</p><p> get to the real truth in this matter. I would never</p><p> forgive myself if he really found something of value</p><p> and lost it because of our incredulity. Now, Friend</p><p> Billings, let us pretend that we are alone. Pay no</p><p> attention to these other men. Listen to my questions,</p><p> and answer them as simply as you can. Remember</p><p> that I am not a scientist and do not understand big</p><p> words. Now, how much yeast does it take to make</p><p> a soldier?”</p><p> “About two drops.”</p><p> “How big does he grow?”</p><p> “About six feet tall.”</p><p> “Do they look like real men ?”</p><p> “Just a little. You see they are made of dough.”</p><p> “Do they walk as we do?”</p><p> “No. It is sort of a creeping shuffle—amoeba</p><p> movement.”</p><p> “If they are not destroyed, how long will they</p><p> live ?”</p><p> “About three days.”</p><p> “What happens then ?”</p><p> “They cease to grow or move. They die and de-</p><p> cay—rot.”</p><p> “Suppose one of them is shot or has his head cut</p><p> off with a saber, or is torn into pieces by a cannon</p><p> ball, what then?”</p><p> “Each piece would keep on living and growing</p><p> and moving till the end of the third day.”</p><p> “You said they would move at eight miles an</p><p> hour?”</p><p> “Yes, if nothing stopped them. They would be</p><p> in Eupenia at the end of forty-eight hours, and by the</p><p> end of the third day they would rot there.”</p><p> “Are you sure of all this?”</p><p> “It worked out in the laboratory.”</p><p> “What makes them grow?”</p><p> “It is a peculiar form of yeast. In the machine</p><p> we compress it. Just as soon as it is liberated, it be-</p><p> gins to extract nitrogen from the air, and expands.</p><p> It not only expands, but it actually grows by the</p><p> rapid division of the yeast cells.”</p><p> “I do not understand it,” said the King, “but I am</p><p> willing to take your word for it. What makes them</p><p> move ?”</p><p> “Radiant energy. Before the yeast is put into the</p><p>30 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> guns, it is thoroughly energized with a form of</p><p> radium.”</p><p> "liut these peculiar creatures cannot fight: they</p><p>have no weapons: how can they win a war?” </p><p> "By their rotting, Your Majesty. 1 have tried to</p><p>make that plain to you. They die and rot.” </p><p> “You mean they decay?"</p><p> “Exactly. They dissolve into pools of slime. They</p><p>form a puddle about three feet in diameter and </p><p>weighing about thirty pounds.” </p><p> "How would such decaying masses stop an invad-</p><p>ing army?” </p><p> “It is their stench that will stop them. The yeast</p><p>is mixed with culture of Bacillus Butericus and </p><p>other foetid germs. These grow in the dying and </p><p>dead yeast, and produce the smell.” </p><p> “That may be true, but your idea that it will stop</p><p>an army is all nonsense. No soldier was checked just </p><p>by a smell.” </p><p> “But this will stop them. I have a little bottle</p><p>here. It has one drop of the end slime diluted a </p><p>thousand times. Have one of your officers smell it.” </p><p>“Any volunteers?” asked the King. </p><p> “Certainly,” answered the Chief of Artillery. “I</p><p>have been in three wars and have smelled everything </p><p>horrible known to any form of campaign. It will </p><p>never hurt me.” </p><p> The inventor held the opened bottle under the mili-</p><p>tary man’s nose. Roughly, the soldier took two deep </p><p>smells. Then Billings corked the bottle, while the </p><p>volunteer slumped from the chair down to the floor </p><p>and lay there, white, sweating and vomiting. The </p><p>others hastened to help him loosen his collar. </p><p> “My God!” exclaimed the King. “Just two whiffs</p><p>from a bottle containing a thousandth of a drop, and </p><p>each dead Yeast Man produces thirty pounds of the </p><p>stuff. Will it kill ?” </p><p> “Not men, but plants,” was Billing’s reply. “Look</p><p>at this.” He emptied the bottle on a large clay jar </p><p>holding a blooming cyclamen. At once the plant </p><p>withered and died. A curious foetid smell filled the </p><p>room. The King rose hastily and sought an opened </p><p>window. So did the rest seek doors and open win-</p><p>dows. while carrying the fainting Chief of the Artil- </p><p>lery Service with them. </p><p> As soon as they got outside the room, in the pure</p><p>air, the King turned to the inventor: </p><p> "Show me just one man like those you describe,</p><p>Mr. Billings—just one man, and the resources of the </p><p>kingdom are at your command.” </p><p> “I have made them. I have one now that is nearly</p><p>three days old. My assistants have been leading him </p><p>around an old deserted race track. You see. they go </p><p>in a straight line unless they are led, and the only </p><p>way we could keep him under observation was to </p><p>lead him around in a track.” </p><p> “We will go and see him.” said the King, “and we</p><p>will take with us the Professor of Mathematics from </p><p>the University. Gentlemen, follow us in your cars.’* </p><p>The party reassembled at an old race track, over- </p><p>grown with grass and a quarter mile in circumfer- </p><p>ence. Slowly walking around this track was an </p><p>assistant from the Morovian laboratories. Other </p><p>men were resting on a bench. The walking man held </p><p>a rope and was leading by it a peculiar creature. It </p><p>was an Yeast Man. </p><p>IMAGINE a six-foot man of dough, with a crust </p><p>hard enough to hold it erect, yet viscid enough to </p><p>allow it to move forward. A creature with a head </p><p>but no face, with spade-like hands without fingers, </p><p>and instead of two legs and feet, simply—simply a </p><p>body like a skirt, which rested firmly on the ground </p><p>on a two-foot base. It was the convulsive movement </p><p>of this base and the mass of fermenting yeast above </p><p>it that in some way enabled it to move slowly over </p><p>the ground. It was such a creature, with a broad </p><p>canvas band around its waist, that the Morovians saw </p><p>being led around the track. Mr. Billings ran for- </p><p>ward eagerly and conferred with his men. Then he </p><p>returned to the group of officers surrounding the </p><p>King. </p><p> “They report that it had gone around the track</p><p>ninety-nine times. That is twenty-three miles and </p><p>nearly twenty-four. It was four feet tall at the end </p><p>of the first day and at the end of the second day it </p><p>was full grown. It is now nearly three days old, </p><p>and if our calculations are correct, it will soon die.” </p><p>The Yeast Man slowly moved around the track. </p><p>Just in front of the tumbled-down grandstand it </p><p>stopped. Billings instructed his men to take off the </p><p>canvas belt. The party gathered around the motion- </p><p>less figure. Suddenly it began to grow shorter and </p><p>stouter. It swayed, and finally out of balance, started </p><p>to fall forward, bending at the waist. An unpleasant</p><p>odor filled the air. Suddenly it bent double, and </p><p>literally melted into a pool of greenish yellow slime. </p><p>The odor grew increasingly frightful, so that it drove </p><p>the observers further and yet further away. The </p><p>grass touched by the slime withered and died. </p><p> The King turned to the professor of mathematics.</p><p>“Professor,” he said, “estimate the size of that pud- </p><p>dle. Multiply it by five billion. Estimate the terri- </p><p>tory filled with that odor. Suppose sw'h masses, five </p><p>billion such masses, were scattered equally over </p><p>Eupenia. What would be the result ?” </p><p> The professor figured on the back of an old en-</p><p>velope. He used the stub of a short pencil which he </p><p>nervously stuck in his mouth after every fifth figure. </p><p>Finally he said, “If you could arrange to have them </p><p>die at different places, the whole of Eupenia would </p><p>be covered about six inches deep.” </p><p> The King turned to his staff:</p><p> “I am satisfied, gentlemen. We will have hun-</p><p>dreds of these machines made, and when we are </p><p>ready to begin operations, Mr. Billings can make </p><p>five thousand Yeast Men to start with. Our citizens </p><p>can lead them for three days, and just as they are </p><p>about to die, we will turn them loose on all the high- </p><p>ways and open spaces leading to Eupenia. At the </p><p>same time, we will start making them by the million. </p><p>Our attack will come before the enemy's ready. If </p><p>it works, we will obtain a bloodless victory. The only </p><p>way we can make a success of it is to spring it on </p><p>them as a total surprise. Cut all the wires leading to </p><p>Eupenia. Confiscate at once all the radio sets. Be </p><p>more careful than ever in watching the suspected </p><p>spies. It would not be a bad idea to imprison them </p><p>till this is over. Put a triple guard on the border. </p><p>Permit no intercommunication. Turn over the en- ' </p><p>tire resources of the kingdom to Mr. Billings and his </p><p>associates. At the same time do not omit a single </p><p>item leading to the preparedness of our little army. </p><p>I understood Von Dort to say that we would be at- </p><p>tacked on the first of October. We will attack be- </p><p>fore then—just as soon as Billings is ready. Have </p><p>any of you a suggestion?” </p><p> “Yes,” said the Chief of Artillery, still pale and</p><p>THE YEAST MEN </p><p>31 </p><p>sweating frotn his recent nausea. “Why not let me </p><p>follow the Yeast Men up and blow them to pieces </p><p>with shrapnel? Make five yeast pieces and five </p><p>stench pots out of each Yeast Man?” </p><p> “I think,” replied the King, “that the Eupenians</p><p>will be only too anxious to do that work for us. </p><p>Again I repeat, gentlemen, that we must observe the </p><p>greatest secrecy. Keep the anti-aircraft machines in </p><p>constant operation, especially on cloudy days. May </p><p>God save our Country and bless our good friend, Mr. </p><p>Billings. Now, Gentlemen, to work, day and night, </p><p>without rest, to make this machinery, gather an </p><p>abundance of material and train men to use the </p><p>machines.” </p><p>NEAR every road connecting the two coun- </p><p>tries, large canvas camouflage screens were </p><p>erected. Captive observation balloons sent up by the </p><p>Eupenian air service reported no massing of Mo- </p><p>ronian troops. Behind these canvas screens, how- </p><p>ever, thousands of the men and women of the little </p><p>mountain kingdom took turns leading five thousand </p><p>Yeast Men in their monotonous journey toward </p><p>death. All day and all night on the 17th, 18th and </p><p>19th of September, these five thousand Yeast Men </p><p>moved and grew behind the protecting curtains. </p><p>Their genesis had been so timed that at dusk on the </p><p>third day they were two days, twenty-three hours </p><p>and thirty minutes old. Then they were turned loose </p><p>on the main highways and were started on their </p><p>slow shuffle toward Eupenia. Some, of course, were </p><p>checked at the border barricades. Others crawled </p><p>around or over and had advanced several hundred </p><p>yards into the enemy’s country before dissolution </p><p>occurred. </p><p> In the meantime peculiar-looking machine guns</p><p>were being placed at intervals of one mile, each </p><p>manned by a group of trained Moronian soldiers. </p><p>These guns were simple in construction, and mounted </p><p>on sturdy tripods. Above each was a small hopper, </p><p>from which yeast was fed to a small but powerful </p><p>press operated by condensed air. Each blow of the </p><p>ram produced a Yeast Man one-eighth of an inch </p><p>high. These were dropped into the barrel of the </p><p>gun and were blown out into the air several hundred </p><p>feet away from the gun. Like thistle down they </p><p>floated, gradually dropping to the ground, base down- </p><p>ward and head erect. Immediately on touching the </p><p>earth, they began their peculiar shuffling movement, </p><p>which was to continue in the exact direction in which </p><p>they had started. As the guns worked, they revolved </p><p>slowly through a forty-five degree horizontal arc. </p><p> Each gun fired two Yeast Men a second. That</p><p>meant one hundred and twenty a minute; seven thou- </p><p>sand. two hundred an hour, or 172,800 in the course </p><p>of twenty-four hours. There were seven hundred </p><p>guns made, but only about five hundred were in </p><p>actual use at any one time; the others acting as re- </p><p>placements. Counting the total time these five hun- </p><p>dred guns were in use, it was later estimated that </p><p>they were fired about ten days. This made a total </p><p>of 1.728.000 for each gun, or a grand total of eight </p><p>hundred and sixty-four million Yeast Men manufac- </p><p>tured during the campaign. Each Yeast Man. dead, </p><p>produced thirty pounds of end-slime, a total of 12,- </p><p>960,000	tons. It will be remembered that this slime,</p><p>in a one-to-a-thousand dilution, was sufficiently </p><p>strong to produce disabling vomiting. </p><p> These guns began operations twenty-four hours</p><p>before the five thousand fully-grown Yeast Men </p><p>were liberated. They then moved slowly forward, </p><p>and behind them came successive waves of smaller </p><p>and yet smaller men of dough. At the end of the </p><p>first twenty-four hours, the oldest of the Yeast Men </p><p>who had been shot from the five hundred guns, were </p><p>nearly four feet high. The woods and fields of </p><p>Eupenia bordering on Moronia were dotted with the </p><p>peculiar creatures. </p><p> The statement made by Mr. Billings that he would</p><p>be able to manufacture them by the billions never </p><p>materialized. The machines worked more slowly </p><p>than he had anticipated. It was also seen that a </p><p>large number were caught in trees and ravines and </p><p>were unable to continue their march. Yet a sufficient </p><p>number reached the smooth highways and level pas- </p><p>tures to do everything that was required of them. </p><p>Also the work was facilitated later in the campaign </p><p>by mounting the guns in airplanes and literally </p><p>showering the towns and cities with the little fellows. </p><p>This, however, was not attempted till it was seen </p><p>that the morale of the Eupenians was completely de- </p><p>stroyed. </p><p>DURING the entire campaign not a single Mo- </p><p>ronian died of injuries incident to warfare, </p><p>though time and again many of them fell exhausted </p><p>from lack of sleep. The radium workers not only </p><p>received painful burns but were affected for several </p><p>years as the result of the prolonged exposure to the </p><p>mysterious emanations from the weird element. </p><p>These, however, were but slight horrors of war com- </p><p>pared with what might have happened had the Eu- </p><p>penian attack found the Moronians in their previous </p><p>defenseless condition. </p><p> During September. 1930, all had been active in the</p><p>kingdom dominated by Premier Plautz, who was the </p><p>real ruler of Eupenia, in place of the feeble-minded </p><p>King. All branches of the army, including the avia- </p><p>tion section, had been mobilized. Fifty thousand </p><p>trained and well-armed men were in camp ready to </p><p>begin the destruction of the little mountainous king- </p><p>dom of Moronia. The attack was timed to begin on </p><p>the first of October. Premier Plautz no longer was </p><p>content with his usual statement that Moronia must </p><p>be destroyed. He was now saying that the time had </p><p>come, for the actual work of destruction to begin. </p><p>An interesting fact was that the escape of Col. </p><p>Von Dort and his admission into Moronia as a place </p><p>of refuge was to be made the actual causa belli. On </p><p>the thirtieth of September his surrender was to be </p><p>demanded within twenty-four hours. If it were </p><p>not conceded, the Eupenian army would at once </p><p>advance. If the demand were complied with, the </p><p>army would advance anyway. Moronia, as far as </p><p>Premier Plautz was concerned, had to be destroyed. </p><p> A broad highway connected the capital cities of</p><p>the two kingdoms. This was the road used by Von </p><p>Dort in his dramatic flight for safety. It was here </p><p>at the border that he had crashed through the bar- </p><p>ricade. At this point, the Eupenian border guard* </p><p>was commanded by Lieutenant Kraut, and under </p><p>him was a company of ninety privates and non- </p><p>commissioned officers. On the evening of the nine- </p><p>teenth of September, the Lieutenant was writing his </p><p>daily report and wishing for something to happen to </p><p>relieve the deadly monotony of daily routine. Just </p><p>as he had finished this report and was signing it, a </p><p>sentry rushed in and stated that a number of pecul- </p><p>32 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>iar looking naked men were at the boundary gate </p><p>trying to enter the country. Suspecting a trap, the </p><p>Lieutenant at once called his entire force to arms </p><p>and personally investigated the matter. When he </p><p>approached the barricade, he was astonished to see </p><p>a number of grayish white creatures, six feet high, </p><p>moving aimlessly on the other side of the gate. They </p><p>had heads without features, bodies without legs, arms </p><p>without fingers. Cautiously, he touched one and </p><p>shivered at the peculiar soft sensation that was im- </p><p>parted by the animal’s skin. Realizing that his men </p><p>were watching him closely and that any sign of </p><p>nervousness on his part would be communicated to </p><p>them, and feeling certain, too, that each of the </p><p>peculiar shapes was but a mask and cloak for a </p><p>Moronian soldier, he drew his revolver and shot </p><p>one of the odd things several times through the </p><p>heart section. The bullet holes closed ancTuiere was </p><p>no blood. The thing kept on with its curious shuf- </p><p>fling movement. </p><p> “Attention, men,” he commanded. “Open the</p><p>gates and we will take them all prisoners. God </p><p>knows what they are. but they cannot hurt us any- </p><p>way, and we will hold them till to-morrow and then </p><p>send them in trucks to the General-in-Chief.” </p><p> His men obeyed the command but there were many</p><p>more of the new creatures than there were soldiers </p><p>and thus while over seventy were captured, several </p><p>hundred passed the barricade and started moving </p><p>down the road. </p><p> In the guard-house the telephone was ringing</p><p>violently. Headquarters wanted to know if any- </p><p>thing new had developed and whether Lieut. Kraut </p><p>and his command were safe. Disquieting messages </p><p>were being received from the other outposts and </p><p>they wanted an immediate report. Lieut. Kraut </p><p>started to tell about the peculiar things he had cap- </p><p>tured, and the Major at the other end of the line </p><p>reprimanded him for being drunk again. The Lieu- </p><p>tenant protested that he was perfectly sober. The </p><p>Major demanded an exact description of the new </p><p>animal. The Lieutenant had one brought into his </p><p>office and held near his desk while he gave a verbal </p><p>description over the telephone. Even while he was </p><p>talking, the animal softened and started to melt. The </p><p>Lieutenant described the process as long as he could </p><p>talk. Even while writhing 011 the floor in deadly </p><p>nausea and vomiting, he tried to tell what had hap- </p><p>pened. but his retching only convinced the Major </p><p>at Headquarters that the Lieutenant was beastly </p><p>drunk. Finally the Lieutenant was dragged out of </p><p>the office by two of his men, who waded through</p><p>pools of indescribable filth to rescue him. He was </p><p>too sick to realize that his entire command had fled </p><p>from the Post, though here and there one of the </p><p>soldiers lay on the road too sick to move. Outside, </p><p>the road was impassable on account of the puddles </p><p>of slime which dotted it. Cursing and vomiting, </p><p>the Lieutenant staggered through the dark woods, </p><p>seeking pure air and freedom from the stench, which </p><p>even in memory produced a recurrence of the pros- </p><p>trating nausea. </p><p> Meantime those of the novel creatures who still</p><p>lived were shuffling slowly down the broad highway, </p><p>every few minutes losing one of their number by </p><p>death and decay. In the dark hours of the night </p><p>they died unseen and unmourned, but each of them </p><p>left behind a horrible evidence that they had once </p><p>lived. Over the pools of slime others of their kind </p><p>walked, some three feet high, others a foot high and </p><p>here and there could be seen midgets only a few </p><p>inches high but resembling their larger brothers in </p><p>every detail. When the sun rose, there also arose </p><p>from every road between the two kingdoms, the </p><p>smell of death a million times magnified. It was </p><p>as though Moronia were surrounded by a circle of </p><p>decay three miles deep. Meantime the smaller, </p><p>younger Yeast Men were advancing into Eupenia, </p><p>through the woods and meadows, tumbling into </p><p>ravines, catching fast in trees and bushes, falling </p><p>into streams and being swept away in the current, </p><p>and yet ever with a sound like soft snow falling, the </p><p>little ones, new born, were floating down through the </p><p>air like goose down, and on and on the machines </p><p>along the border of Moronia kept up their gentle </p><p>thump-thump-thump and with each thump was cre- </p><p>ated one more new life, one more soldier, brainless, </p><p>fearless, bloodless, filled with the urge to keep on </p><p>moving till dissolution came. And they all moved </p><p>downhill, from the mountainous Moronia, into the </p><p>enemies’ more level country. They were perfect </p><p>soldiers. </p><p> All the Eupenian out-posts had experienced the</p><p>same novel sensations and made the same report that </p><p>was made by Lieutenant Kraut as soon as he was </p><p>able to talk. None of the officers who came to head- </p><p>quarters to report could produce any proof that </p><p>they really had seen such massive monstrosities. </p><p>Every officer had to periodically stop his verbal re- </p><p>port till another period of vomiting had passed. The </p><p>Commander-in-Chief thoroughly believed that they </p><p>had gone drunk and insane through the effects of </p><p>cheap whiskey and put them all under arrest. At </p><p>the same time he sent several spies on motor-cycles </p><p>to make a thorough investigation. These returned </p><p>babbling hysterically of an army of creatures of </p><p>all sizes, and every spy was vomiting with the same</p><p>enthusiastic persistency that the officers had shown. </p><p>The Commander-in-Chief began to curse the morals </p><p>of his army and went and started to get “drunk” </p><p>himself. </p><p> Even then Eupenia might have saved herself,</p><p>though it is a question as to just how efficacious any </p><p>campaign of shrapnel, or any building of fences or </p><p>digging of ditches, would have proved. W’hat really </p><p>happened was no doubt inevitable, yet the fact re- </p><p>mains, and it is of historical importance, that twenty- </p><p>four hours passed before any offensive was started. </p><p>Data was gathered and observations and lengthy re- </p><p>ports were made. Otherwise nothing was done. </p><p>These reports, especially from the border regions, </p><p>were of such a varied and fantastic nature that little </p><p>value could be placed on them. </p><p>FINALLY Premier Plautz decided to personally </p><p>investigate the situation. He took with him the </p><p>Chief-of-Staff and a group of scientists from the </p><p>University. They found the new creatures by the </p><p>hundreds of thousands and of all sizes. They also, </p><p>came as near as they could to several of the puddles </p><p>of end-slime. An effort to observe these carefully </p><p>with the aid of gas masks was useless. Even when </p><p>some of the foetid material was gathered at the end </p><p>of a long pole, it could not be brought close enough </p><p>to make any observations of value. Several of the </p><p>things were carefully studied, both chemically and </p><p>anatomically, but not a single observer connected the </p><p>moving oddities with the pools of decay. It must </p><p>THE YEAST MEN </p><p>33 </p><p>be remembered that after the first hour of the offen- </p><p>sive no more Yeast Men had died, and the reports </p><p>of the rapid dissolution of the first wave were en- </p><p>tirely discredited. </p><p> For the first time in his life, Premier Plautz was</p><p>at a loss to know what to do. To him the entire </p><p>situation was incomprehensible. At one side of his </p><p>automobile a five foot abortion was slowly moving, </p><p>its featureless face asking only one question. “Why </p><p>was I made?” In the Premier’s hand was a watch </p><p>crystal and on the glass was a new creation, barely </p><p>a quarter of an inch high, in every respect the exact </p><p>duplicate of its brother standing by the side of the </p><p>car.	X</p><p> “What does this mean, Professor Owens?” the</p><p>puzzled Premier asked the Chemistry teacher. </p><p>“What kind of things are these? They cannot fight. </p><p>They have no weapons, no brains, no blood. All </p><p>they know is how to grow and move forward. Evi- </p><p>dently they come from Moronia, but for what reason. </p><p>Is it a declaration of war?” </p><p> The old Professor answered to the best of his</p><p>ability and what he said was surprisingly near the </p><p>truth. </p><p> “They are just Yeast Men, Your Excellency. I</p><p>have examined them in every way, chemically and </p><p>microscopically and they are just peculiarly shaped </p><p>masses of dough animated by some very active </p><p>yeast. Their movements resemble dough overflow- </p><p>ing a pan. 1 do not know what they mean but I do </p><p>know what they are. I have had one cut up and </p><p>baked in loaves and it tastes like a fairly good kind </p><p>of whole wheat bread.” </p><p> Here the Chief-of-Staff interrupted.</p><p> “Of course we could consider it as a declaration</p><p>of war and attack, but what would be the influence </p><p>on the world’s opinion of us? Reporters would </p><p>rush in from the Paris and London papers. They </p><p>would make us a laughing stock of the universe. </p><p>What could we say? That we were afraid of lumps </p><p>of yeast? That wc were using our artillery on po- </p><p>tential loaves of bread? So far, these creatures </p><p>have not committed a single deprivation. No lives </p><p>have been lost, not a house burned, not a single pig </p><p>or chicken killed. Think what a reporter from an </p><p>American paper would do to us if he had a chance </p><p>to write it up? How he would describe our infantry </p><p>pouring bullets into dough, our brave cavalry men </p><p>cutting the heads off of bread men? Far better</p><p>would it be to take them as fast as we can and dis- </p><p>tribute them among all of our people and let them </p><p>make bread with them. That would be a joke. The </p><p>Eupeivan nation being fed at the expense of the </p><p>very enemy who hates them so.” </p><p> ' 1 believe you are right!” answered the Premier.</p><p>“There is certainly nothing in such creatures to be </p><p>afraid of, though their number seems to be increas- </p><p>ing hourly. It was all well enough for the ignorant </p><p>peasants to run in terror from their farms, but the </p><p>city folk will look on it as a great joke—especially </p><p>if we use the proper kind of propaganda. Suppose </p><p>we go back at once to the capitol and prepare a </p><p>statement for the press.” </p><p> The next edition of The Staatsbote, the leading</p><p>afternoon paper in Eupenia, ran the following news </p><p>item on the front page, </p><p>HAVE YOU A LITTLE YEAST MAN </p><p>IN YOUR HOME? IF NOT, </p><p>WHY NOT? </p><p> All citizens are urged to at once provide</p><p> their homes with one or more Yeast Men.</p><p> These peculiar creatures arc very harmless</p><p> and the Department of Chemical Research</p><p> assures us that they make a very fair quality</p><p> of bread. They come in all sizes. When</p><p> little, your children can play with them as</p><p> dolls; when full sized, they can reduce the</p><p> High Cost of Living.</p><p> All citizens having automobiles are com-</p><p> manded to go into the country regions and</p><p> bring to their homes as many of these Yeast</p><p> Men as they can accommodate. Bring extra</p><p> ones for your poorer neighbor.</p><p> Army trucks will make regular trips to</p><p> bring these Yeast Men to the Capitol. After</p><p> they are paraded through the streets they</p><p> will be distributed to all families not yet</p><p> provided.</p><p> This item was published on the afternoon of the</p><p>second day. All that afternoon and evening thou- </p><p>sands of Yeast Men were brought into the towns </p><p>and cities of Eupenia in private automobiles and </p><p>army trucks. The Premier, quick to act for his </p><p>personal advantage issued an order canceling all </p><p>contracts for'flour and directing that the army be </p><p>supplied with bread baked from the dough creatures. </p><p>Each company in the army was directed to forage </p><p>for its own supply and to keep them in their tents </p><p>till they were needed for baking bread.</p><p> The next morning, which was the beginning of</p><p>the third day of the Moronian offensive, thousands </p><p>of the Yeast Men were exhibited in parade through </p><p>the streets of the Eupenian capital, each one in </p><p>charge of a soldier. The citizens laughed till they </p><p>cried at the comical spectacle, and slapped each other </p><p>on the back as they pointed out “the only kind of </p><p>soldiers Moronia could attack with.” Within a few </p><p>hours it became quite the fashion to have your own </p><p>jiersonal Yeast Man. Children walked around lead- </p><p>ing their little dough pets. High School pupils </p><p>painted theirs with the class colors and numerals. </p><p>These things could be led and guided. Herr Schmidt, </p><p>Honorable President of the Ancient Order of Eu- </p><p>penian Cab Drivers, made a harness for a pair and </p><p>had them draw a light buggy through the streets, </p><p>with his grandson for driver. </p><p> That third day was a fete day for all Eupenia.</p><p>The Premier, however, had gone to unnecessary </p><p>labor to bring the Yeast Men into the city. By noon </p><p>they were beginning to arrive of their own accord, </p><p>by the hundreds of thousands: by afternoon the </p><p>streets were crowded with them. Instead of being </p><p>a joke, this thing w’as becoming a problem. They </p><p>were gathered into the parks, thrown into the cellars, </p><p>herded out into the country, but still they came in </p><p>increasing numbers. Every house had one or more: </p><p>not a basement but was filled with a reserve supply; </p><p>the barracks and tents of the army were overrun. </p><p>The morning paper estimated that there was enough </p><p>dough to provide bread for half a year. The prob- </p><p>lem now was not how to get them into the city but </p><p>how to get them out and keep them out. In spite </p><p>of Premier Plautz’ reassurance in the afternoon </p><p>34 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>paper and definite orders for the army to advance </p><p>on the next day, the entire populace was beginning </p><p>to be worried. </p><p> Their chief anxiety arose because of the fact that</p><p>they could not understand or comprehend the </p><p>situation. </p><p>THEN, just towards evening, the Yeast Men </p><p>began to die. Not all at once, but in increasing </p><p>numbers. And twilight advanced to add darkness </p><p>to the horror. Then they died by thousands and </p><p>hundreds of thousands all over Eupenia. It was </p><p>bad enough in the country districts where here and </p><p>there the pools of end-slime dotted the woods and </p><p>the meadows; but in the cities, especially in the </p><p>Capital, the immediate result was a panic. In hut </p><p>and palace, home and barracks, life was no longer </p><p>possible 011 account of these thousands of puddles </p><p>of nausea-producing slime. The houses were filled </p><p>with it. The streets were filled with it. The only </p><p>living things that were unaffected were the Yeast </p><p>Men waiting for their turn to die. With sightless </p><p>faces they shuffled along the streets passing uncon- </p><p>cerned through the decayed bodies of their brothers </p><p>with apparently only one idea—to keep moving till </p><p>death came to enable them to add their bit to the </p><p>defence of their country. </p><p> The people fled. Sick and sweating, pale-faced</p><p>and gasping, incapacitated and vomiting, they ran </p><p>from the terror. The army fled, cursing the Premier </p><p>for thinking to feed them on such putrid offal. Noth- </p><p>ing could hold them, or restore discipline. And </p><p>around Moronia was a widening, desolate, deserted </p><p>ring in which there was no living thing. </p><p> The people fled to the border. The neighboring</p><p>Kingdoms, however, friendly as they were to Eu- </p><p>penia, thought of their own safety. In this strange </p><p>vomiting, in the tales of delirium told by the first </p><p>refugees, they thought they saw symptoms of a new </p><p>and deadly contagious disease and at once threw a </p><p>line of bayonets along their borders and forbade </p><p>emigration from the stricken land. </p><p> Eupenia deserted her Capital without shedding a</p><p>drop of blood. </p><p> Premier Plautz, as soon as he had sufficiently</p><p>recovered from his own personal vomiting, to con- </p><p>sider the matter, called a meeting of his Staff and </p><p>ordered the advance to begin against the enemy. </p><p>This, he said, was only a new method of conducting </p><p>war. Were they to be conquered by smells or inert</p><p>lumps of yeast? Let the artillery blow them to </p><p>pieces. Let the cavalry cut them to pieces. The </p><p>infantry could build fires and burn them. A faith- </p><p>ful remnant of the once proud army attempted to </p><p>follow out his orders but no soldier, however brave, </p><p>can continually fight on an empty stomach, and no </p><p>officer, however capable, can give orders while con- </p><p>stantly vomiting. The arqiy, from the General-in- </p><p>Chief down to the privates, were continually sick </p><p>with the sickness of Jonah’s Whale. </p><p> The whole resistance was hopeless. The Yeast</p><p>Men arrived day after day in increasing numbers </p><p>and they could not be killed. They could be muti- </p><p>lated. dissevered, decapitated, but each piece lived </p><p>and moved onwards. </p><p> Efforts at their destruction only added to the</p><p>horror, and put the finishing touch to the destruction </p><p>of morale. </p><p> W hat use cutting a thing to pieces when each</p><p>piece kept on living and advancing? How could </p><p>an enemy be killed when it could not bleed? </p><p> Eupenia was hysterical.</p><p> On the sixth day, the army revolted, killed Pre-</p><p>mier Plautz and declared the Kingdom a Republic. </p><p> Immediately they sued for peace by radio. Mo-</p><p>ronia suspected a trap and refused to grant an </p><p>armistice. Her guns continued the deadly shower. </p><p>Finally, on the tenth day of the unequal struggle, </p><p>peace was declared. </p><p> Afterwards, the world blamed Moronia for not</p><p>granting an immediate armistice, but it is only fair </p><p>to her to say that she did not know the full horror </p><p>of the war at the time and never did realize it as the </p><p>Eupenians did. She was anxious enough for peace, </p><p>but she wanted a peace that would be permanent. </p><p> But Eupenia not only wanted peace, she wanted</p><p>help to rid her of the millions of tons of terrible </p><p>end-slime. Mr. Billings was called in for advice. </p><p>He laughed at the question. </p><p> "The smell only lasts for ten days,” he said, and</p><p>then dies out and the slime simply becomes a highly </p><p>concentrated manure, more rich than any commer- </p><p>cial fertilizer that we have yet discovered. The </p><p>fields of Eupenia will be the more fertile because </p><p>of this manure. Tell the farmers to be patient and </p><p>hopeful. They will have fine crops next year. The </p><p>city people can shovel it up for their window boxes: </p><p>it will grow wonderful violets.” </p><p> Later on, at the close of the Peace Festival, Mr.</p><p>Billings was decorated. The little old King, Ru- </p><p>dolph Hul&gt;elaire, put his one arm around the in- </p><p>ventor and kissed him on both cheeks. Then he </p><p>pinned the decoration of the Golden Moronian Eagle </p><p>on him, while the people cheered. </p><p> “I want to raise your salary,” said the King.</p><p> “The only rays I am interested in,” replied the</p><p>inventor, who had not been paying much attention </p><p>to what the King was saying, “are the light-and </p><p>energy-rays. I have another idea about them which </p><p>I think I can work out if you will let me have some </p><p>money for my experimentation.” </p><p> “You can have all the money you want!” was the</p><p>King's eager answer. “But tell me one thing. What </p><p>made those Yeast Men grow and move the way </p><p>they did?” </p><p> “It was like this, Your Majesty. They were just</p><p>yeast cells but they were filled with a special dynamic </p><p>energy, a very special form of energy. I could tell </p><p>you all about it, but I am afraid that it would be </p><p>hard for you to follow my technical explanation.” </p><p> “I know I couldn’t,” laughed the King. “I_wish</p><p>you could put that kind of energy into my people. </p><p>We could win the commerce of the world. But I </p><p>suppose you can do things with yeast that you can- </p><p>not do with human beings. Now let us go to the </p><p>banquet. The people are anxious to hear you.” </p><p> And Mr. Billings of the United States of America</p><p>Said to Rudolph Hubelaire, King of Moronia, </p><p> “I am not very good at speechifying.”</p><p>THE END. </p><p>TfrWVY OF A DINOSAUR </p><p>by Harley S.Aldingcr </p><p>MIGHTY tree in that great primeval </p><p>jungle of the Mesozoic age was pushed </p><p>aside, as you or I might lightly push </p><p>aside a willow bush, and the terrifying </p><p>head of Cayna. the tyrannosaurus, King </p><p>of the Jungle, was thrust through. </p><p> His little, red-rimmed, cold, reptilian eyes were</p><p>blazing with hate and menace, for Cayna was in </p><p>another of his blood-rampages that day, and woe </p><p>betide the unlucky animals whom he encountered, no </p><p>matter what (heir size and strength might be. It </p><p>was a blood lust of a fierceness and wantonness, to </p><p>which only Cayna could </p><p>attain.	—</p><p> As the battle - scarred</p><p>old warrior stepped out </p><p>from behind the tree, he </p><p>presented a frightful and </p><p>menacing sight. He tow- </p><p>ered fully forty feet high, </p><p>with great jaws four feet </p><p>in length set in his mas- </p><p>sive head, with fangs six • , ; ——— </p><p>or seven inches long, and </p><p>supported by his mighty hind limbs, which could </p><p>send him forward with great leaps and bounds, at </p><p>need, with the speed of an express train. He had </p><p>a massive tail, fully forty feet long, gigantic at the </p><p>base, and tapering gradually to a small tip: a ter- </p><p>rible engine of destruction. The tyrannosaurus, in </p><p>fact, is known as the most destructive living thing </p><p>that ever existed. Cayna’s comparatively small fore- </p><p>legs were armed with rending claws. </p><p> /T is always interesting to imagine what our earth</p><p> looked like millions of years ago; before man had ap-</p><p> peared, the time when the giant animals of the Mesozoic</p><p> Age were roaming over our planet. How did they live,</p><p> and what did they do? Our new author has developed a</p><p> charming tale, based upon accurate scientific knoivlcdge,</p><p> a story that despite its shortness, is highly interesting and</p><p> gives us an excellent idea of the past and bloody age.</p><p> He strode through the giant trees with his body</p><p>bent forward at an angle of about forty-five degrees, </p><p>with small eyes searching malevolently for some </p><p>opponent, against whom to pit his mighty thews and </p><p>destroying armament. His huge mouth was half </p><p>open, and from time to time he emitted thunderous </p><p>roars and screams of defiance. </p><p> The other animals knew from these sounds that</p><p>the mighty king was abroad, and thirsting for blood, </p><p>so everywhere he found all game departed from </p><p>his path. </p><p> Becoming more cunning, but no less fierce or</p><p> relentless in his blood-</p><p> hunt, Cayna ceased his</p><p> roaring and screaming,</p><p> and crept stealthily</p><p> through the jungle, soft-</p><p> footed as a cat.</p><p> As lie did so, he saw.</p><p> not a hundred feet away, a</p><p> giant pterodactyl, a great,</p><p>_ winged reptile with bat- </p><p>-——--- like, feather less wings, </p><p> having four legs, each ter-</p><p> minating in four fingers, one of which was fastened</p><p> to the wings. That is how they derived their name,</p><p> “wing-fingered.” It had a short head and a beak,</p><p> filled with needle-sharp teeth. He saw it swoop</p><p> down and seize a small mammal about the size of</p><p> a sheep, and drawing the struggling animal into the</p><p> air. plunge its mighty beak into the base of the neck.</p><p> With a shrill cry, the mammal grew limp in the</p><p> pterodactyl’s wing-fingers.</p><p>It had an abnormally long neck, with a head at the end so small that It looked like a mere continuation of the neck . . . Cayna charged </p><p>forth, and, leaping upon the mountainous back, buried his great fangs in the thick rolls of flesh at the base of the neck . . . </p><p>35 </p><p>36 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> Burdened by the heavy load, the reptile Hew</p><p>heavily, just clearing the treetops. He had gone </p><p>about a hundred feet, when a mighty head was up- </p><p>reared over the tree tops, mighty jaws yawned cav- </p><p>ernously, and the great bird-lizard and its prey were </p><p>crunched together in the grinding jaws of the flesh- </p><p>eater. </p><p> Having finished his repast, Cayna set forth again</p><p>to see what new adventure the day would bring him. </p><p>He did not have to look far. </p><p> Out into a small clearing stepped an animal which</p><p>resembled a living Gibraltar. It traveled on all </p><p>fours, but its hind limbs were four times as long as </p><p>the forelegs, so that its nose almost touched the </p><p>ground. It stood sixteen feet high at the thighs, </p><p>was covered with hard, bony, plates, except on the </p><p>underbody, forming an impenetrable armor. From </p><p>the base of the head, over the back, and halfway </p><p>down its tail, was a succession of bony plates in </p><p>double columns, and varying in height from a couple </p><p>of inches to three feet, each razor-sharp at the edges, </p><p>and coming to a sharp point at the top. The head </p><p>was very small, and triangular in shape, with small </p><p>eyes, and a mouth that cleft back past its eyes. Its </p><p>monstrous tail was its one means of offense or de- </p><p>fense. Enormous at the base, (fully ten feet in </p><p>diameter,) it tapered gradually for its whole length </p><p>of twenty-five feet, and ended in a very blunt tip. </p><p>Where the bony, finlike, plates had ended in the </p><p>middle of the tail, a series of four pairs of extremely </p><p>sharp, conical, spikes, of about two feet in length, </p><p>began. When the stegosaurus lashed out with this </p><p>spiked tail, it would produce the same result, as if </p><p>you hit a person with a board through which a series </p><p>of nails had been driven. </p><p> This, then, was the monster upon which the flesh-</p><p>eating tyrannosaurus looked. Ordinarily, in the </p><p>presence of other, and more easily conquered game, </p><p>he would have passed the stegosaurus by, for the </p><p>“Plated Lizard” was regarded by the other dinosaurs </p><p>in the same way as the present animals regard a </p><p>porcupine. But Cayna was in no mood to pass any- </p><p>thing by with which he might do battle. </p><p> So. with a mighty roar, he charged the armored</p><p>dinosaur, lashing out at the other’s head with one of </p><p>his smaller forelegs. But the stegosaurus had antici- </p><p>pated the movement, and had drawn its head inside </p><p>its armor, like a mud-turtle, and the blow only </p><p>scraped the impenetrable plates on its neck. </p><p> Thus they jockeyed around for some moments,</p><p>the tyrannosaurus always being careful to keep at </p><p>the other’s head end, out of reach of the destroying </p><p>tail, and the stegosaurus endeavoring to wheel and </p><p>strike a bone-crushing blow with his spiked </p><p>appendage. </p><p> But the old king had not survived many fierce</p><p>battles by sheer luck. He resorted to strategy. </p><p>Striking a slow, hesitating blow toward the other’s </p><p>concealed head, he induced the sluggish giant to </p><p>strike at it. This it did, and when its head was fully </p><p>out, the wily monarch lashed out. carrying away the </p><p>right side, and one eye, of the “plated dinosaur’s” </p><p>face. </p><p> Screaming in amazement, the great stegosaurus</p><p>reared up on its hind legs. It was the opening for </p><p>which Cayna had been waiting. Leaping forward, </p><p>he sized the other’s neck with both forepaws. </p><p>Then, supporting himself with his tail, he swiftly </p><p>disemboweled the other with his immense hind legs. </p><p>The great tail of the stegosaurus lashed convulsively </p><p>for a few seconds, then was still, and the flesh-eater </p><p>dined well. </p><p>HAVING satisfied his hunger, but not his blood </p><p>lust, Cayna went forth again, until he arrived </p><p>at a rather small plain. Nearby, alongside a great </p><p>boulder, was a huge bull triceratops, snorting and </p><p>pawing the earth savagely. He was evidently an </p><p>outcast from a vast herd which could 1)e seen in the </p><p>distance, stretching as far as eye could reach, count- </p><p>less thousands. </p><p> The triceratops was about eleven feet tall at the</p><p>thigh, where, like the stegosaurus, he was the tall- </p><p>est. However, his forelegs were not nearly so short, </p><p>in comparison to the hind legs, as were the stego- </p><p>saurus’. He was, also like the stegosaurus, covered </p><p>with hard bony plates or knobs, which served him </p><p>as armor. He also possessed a bony frill about his </p><p>neck, which gave him the appearance of a Roman </p><p>gladiator. He had, characteristic of a dinosaur, </p><p>a great tail, enormous at the base, and tapering- </p><p>gradual ly. Three horns and a parrot-like beak com- </p><p>pletes his description. One horn over the nose, was </p><p>about a foot and a half in length, and the other two, </p><p>one over each eye, four or five feet in length. And </p><p>all three were of needle-like sharpness. A monster </p><p>worthy of the gigantic Cayna’s best efforts. </p><p> Charging, with a roar, out into the open, the</p><p>tyrannosaurus leaped upon the “three-horns” back, </p><p>endeavoring to sink his giant fangs through the im- </p><p>penetrable armor. But his efforts were unavailing. </p><p> The triceratops, with an impatient shake of its</p><p>mighty frame, hurled the tyrannosaurus from its </p><p>insecure hold, up against the great boulder. Then, </p><p>whirling rapidly, it sank its shorter nose-horn its </p><p>full length into the tyrannosaurus. </p><p> The old monarch, in desperation, seized the other</p><p>two great horns of the triceratops in his smaller fore- </p><p>paws, and forcing the great head down, thus origi- </p><p>nated a hold which rendered the other helpless. </p><p> The triceratops, bellowing insanely, continued to</p><p>gore and slit the tyrannosaurus’ flesh to ribbons, </p><p>with his nose horn and parrot-like beak, but was </p><p>unable to inflict a fatal wound. But in spite of his </p><p>terrible punishment, the tyrannosaurus continued to </p><p>force the great head downward; and finally it touched </p><p>the ground. Then, screaming in triumph, he sank </p><p>his great fangs into the now unprotected neck, </p><p>crunching it until he severed the spinal column, and </p><p>the horned giant fell dead at his feet. </p><p> But the old king had not escaped unscathed, and</p><p>he was bleeding from a score of wounds, so, 110 </p><p>sooner was_ his adversary dead, than he hurried </p><p>away to a little pool he knew of, to lick and bathe </p><p>his wounds. He was chastened in body, but not in </p><p>spirit, and his two previous battles had only caused </p><p>the flame of his blood lust to burn more brightly. </p><p> After perhaps an hour of bathing and licking his</p><p>wounds, Cayna ventured forth once more, coming </p><p>finally to a pebbled beach by the great sea water. </p><p> He found a gigantic brontosaurus basking at full</p><p>length upon it. Of all the colossal dinosaurs, there </p><p>were none so huge as the brontosaurus, excepting </p><p>the diplodoeus, a creature greatly resembling him. </p><p> A great monster, about seventy-five feet long,</p><p>standing sixteen feet at the thigh’(where, a char- </p><p>acteristic of a dinosaur, it stood the tallest), and </p><p>weighing nearly forty tons. It had 110 system of </p><p>THE WAY OF A DINOSAUR </p><p>37 </p><p>offense or defense, except the great tail, eight feet </p><p>in diameter at the base, and trailing out behind for </p><p>sixty or seventy feet. It had an abnormally long </p><p>neck, with a head at the end so small that it looked </p><p>like a mere continuation of the neck. </p><p> This, then, was the creature upon which Cayna</p><p>charged forth, and leaping upon the mountainous </p><p>back, buried his great fangs in the thick rolls of </p><p>flesh at the base of the neck, and ground steadily </p><p>downward in a search for the spinal column. </p><p> The monster, at the first attack, had leaped,</p><p>screaming shrilly, into the air, for all its great </p><p>weight. It bit, ineffectually, at the tyrannosaurus’ </p><p>heavy hide, with its small, frail teeth, and lashed at </p><p>it with its heavy tail. The last, however, was not </p><p>entirely ineffectual. The whip-like tip cut the tyran- </p><p>nosaurus’ back to ribbons, but the great saurian was </p><p>unable to reach the other with the heavier part of </p><p>its tail, or Cayna’s story would now be over. </p><p> In desperation, the monster finally charged out</p><p>into the sea, where it was infinitely more agile than </p><p>on land. </p><p> Charging out swiftly, he reached deep water, and</p><p>started to roll over on the tyrannosaurus. But it </p><p>was never accomplished, for at that moment, Cayna’s </p><p>six inch fangs ground home, and the brontosaurus </p><p>rolled over on its back, dead. </p><p> The hideously mangled, but victorious king, after</p><p>having assured himself that his adversary was dead, </p><p>began to swim slowly toward the shore. But he </p><p>never reached it. </p><p> For, at that moment., an ichthyosaurus, a thirty-</p><p>foot, saw-toothed jawed, sea-dinosaur. swopt up </p><p>from below and buried half its saw-like jaw into </p><p>the tyrannosaurus. </p><p> Whipping frenziedly about, the great saurian bit</p><p>the ichthyosaurus’ head entirely off, in his rage, but </p><p>at that moment an entire school of the bloodthirsty </p><p>fish-lizards swept up, and the tyrannosaurus dis- </p><p>appeared in a boiling, bloody, inferno. </p><p> And thus Cayna, the king, went the way of a</p><p>dinosaur, meeting the fate of all the bloodthirsty </p><p>breed, sooner or later. </p><p>THE END </p><p>What Do You Know?</p><p>READERS of Amazing Stories have frequently commented upon the fact that there is more actual knowl- </p><p>edge to he gained through reading its pages than from many a textbook.

Munchhausen Departs for the Planet Mars.</p><p>XCE upon a time, a grouchy young </p><p>gentleman with a grievance for fiction </p><p>writers, probably because they received </p><p>more emoluments for their stuff than he </p><p>did for bis poetry, thus vented his re- </p><p>sentment in immortal song: </p><p> “ Tis strange, but true; for truth is always strange</p><p>—stranger than fiction.” </p><p> Prom this, some coarse soul, totally oblivious of</p><p>any poetic infection, took it upon himself to mutilate </p><p>the above passage of one of Lord Byron’s poems </p><p>and taught us unsuspecting mortals to say parrot- </p><p>wise, ever after until the end of fiction, thusly: </p><p>"Truth is stranger than fiction!” </p><p> With all due regard to the memory and genius of</p><p>Byron, I, 1. M. Alier, a citizen of a free country, take </p><p>it upon myself to correct his Lordship at this late </p><p>and quarrelsome date, to wit: </p><p> "There is no fiction.”</p><p> If, as it has often—no, always—been proved that</p><p>the most fantastic fiction at some time or other in- </p><p>variably comes true, then by all processes of modern </p><p>logic, there can be no such thing as fiction. It simply </p><p>does not exist. This brings us face to face with the </p><p>startling result that if fiction always comes true </p><p>some time or other, why then, bless their dear souls, </p><p>all fiction writers must be prophets! Hurrah for </p><p>the F. W.'s! But hold on, </p><p>boys; don't let our enthu- </p><p>siasm run away with us. </p><p>While it is nice to be a </p><p>prophet, don’t forget that </p><p>a prophet is never, never </p><p>recognized in his own </p><p>country. Thus the New </p><p>Testament teaches; so I </p><p>think it will Ik* safer for </p><p>all F. W.'s to remain </p><p>F. W.’s, rather than be- </p><p>come honorless prophets. </p><p> However, that is not</p><p>what 1 had in mind when </p><p>I started—it’s so hard for </p><p>me to say what I mean, and </p><p>a good deal harder for me to keep my thoughts run-</p><p>ning on the track. They ramble from one nothing- </p><p>nes&gt; into another. My mind, in that respect, is a </p><p>good deal like a one-eyed, religious old cow on a </p><p>pasture. She eats up whatever she sees alongside of </p><p>her, but when she finally turns around, she perceives, </p><p>with astonishment, that there is still a lot to graze </p><p>on the other side; so she steers around to starboard </p><p>and returns to her original starting point. </p><p> But 1 am rambling again, so let’s return to the</p><p>place we started from. </p><p> Seriously speaking, and bv way of emphasizing</p><p>how much stranger truth is than fiction, T have but </p><p>to point to Jules Verne's famous stories. Fifty-eight </p><p>years ago when he wrote “Twenty Thousand </p><p>Leagues Under the Sea,” no one took him seriously. </p><p>It is doubtful whether he himself believed that the </p><p>submarine which he invented in that story would </p><p>ever become practical. It was just fiction. Yet </p><p>forty-five years later, a submarine, almost exactly </p><p>like the one his vivid and prophetic mind conceived, </p><p>emerges from a German harbor and travels under </p><p>its own power over a distance of 4,(XX) miles, through </p><p>the North Sea, the English Channel, down the At- </p><p>lantic, through the entire length of the Mediterranean </p><p>and up through the Dardanelles to Constantinople! </p><p>And by way of diversion it manages to sink several </p><p>battleships of the enemy by means of its torpedoes. </p><p>Now, bold as he was, Jules Verne never conceived </p><p>such an “impossible thing," and while his famous </p><p>Nautilus was equipped with almost every other </p><p>modern submarine necessity, the infernal atitomobile- </p><p>torpedo was missing. Truth is indeed very much </p><p>stranger than fiction. But I mustn’t ramble. </p><p> Munchhausen, as will be remembered, had ex-</p><p>plained the mysteries of the moon to me, and he had </p><p>also mentioned the great danger of falling meteorites </p><p>which had been increasing alarmingly in number for </p><p>some time. The moon’s attenuated atmosphere offers </p><p>no protection from mete- </p><p>ors, as does the earth’? </p><p>thick air. But few mete- </p><p>ors ever reach the surface </p><p>of the earth; the intense </p><p>friction between the me- </p><p>teor and the air ignites the </p><p>former, and most of it </p><p>falls as a fine dust. The </p><p>burning of the meteors </p><p>represents t h e shooting </p><p>stars we see. On the moon, </p><p>however, the meteors crash </p><p>down bodily, causing tre- </p><p>mendous havoc, and this </p><p>terrible bombardment goes</p><p>on forever without let-up. </p><p>Consequently, when Baron Miinchhauscn stopped </p><p>short that evening in the midst of a sentence, I natur- </p><p>ally was alarmed not a little. Great was my joy, </p><p>therefore, when, sitting before my radio set thonext </p><p>evening, ’phone clapped tight over my ears, my eyes </p><p>glued on the clock, the familiar high, whining spark </p><p>suddenly reverberated in my ears at the stroke of 11 </p><p>o’clock. </p><p> It was Munchhausen. But his usual sonorous</p><p>voice to-night had an unfamiliar metallic timbre </p><p>that puzzled me greatly; in a short time, however, </p><p>the mystery was cleared : </p><p> OHAKESPEARE, the master of the drama, never con-</p><p> ceivcd anything like a drama of an entire world—mil-</p><p> lions of intelligent beings — fighting a heroic battle —a</p><p> battle for existence.

The three</p><p> flyers marked an equilateral triangle while in the exact center, but about one mile lower down than the flyers, our Interstellar was float-</p><p> ing. Three shafts of an intense yellow ray were turned on us, and it was this light, or rather the peculiar properties of the rays, which</p><p>had made us captives to the Martians’ superior intelligence. </p><p>39 </p><p>40 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> “My dear Alier. No doubt you thought I had</p><p>been killed by a meteor last night. Well, as you </p><p>Americans put it, 1 certainly had ‘a close shave.’ A </p><p>meteor crashed down on my aerial 50 feet from </p><p>where 1 was sitting; of course it went up in smoke— </p><p>metallic vapor, to be correct—due to the tremendous </p><p>heat generated by the impact of the meteor on the </p><p>granite rocks. The meteor went up in a fiery cloud </p><p>of red vapor and I was blown headlong a distance </p><p>of over 50 feet, right down into the mouth of a giant </p><p>crater, by the resulting blast of the concussion. </p><p> “This long-extinct crater is a very deep one; how</p><p>deep, I was soon to learn! I went down head first </p><p>and kept on falling down that abyss at a terrific </p><p>rate of speed, for what seemed to be hours. As I </p><p>kept on plunging down, I was gloomily reflecting </p><p>what an inglorious end it was. to die at the bottom of </p><p>an unromantic crater on a dead and dried-up moon. </p><p>I thought of many things, when I suddenly became </p><p>conscious of a frightful cold. Call it instinct or pres- </p><p>ence of mind, or what you will, but, as soon as I </p><p>had started on my downward journey, I had jerked </p><p>my body in such a manner as to righten it; in other </p><p>words, after a few attempts, I succeeded in falling </p><p>feet down. It was indeed a fortunate circumstance </p><p>that the sun was almost directly over the crater, for </p><p>it saved me the anguish of plunging into a pitch- </p><p>black abyss. While it was not nearly as light as it was </p><p>at the top, still I could see where I was falling, and </p><p>that was some consolation. Thus, when I glanced </p><p>down toward mv feet after a while, I am sure that </p><p>my heart, which had lost some beats, stood still en- </p><p>tirely. It took me a few seconds to collect my be- </p><p>wildered senses, for this is what I saw: </p><p> “The crater had no bottom at all: it went right</p><p>through to the center of the moon, where it con- </p><p>nected with another crater, which went to the op- </p><p>posite side. I knew this must be so because when I </p><p>looked down I saw several stars shining through </p><p>brilliantly from the night side of the moon. Then </p><p>the awful truth flashed through me and I almost </p><p>swooned. I was falling through the whole diameter </p><p>of the moon! I had been in many tight quarters be- </p><p>fore, during my somewhat exciting career, but this </p><p>experience indeed bade well to be the inglorious end </p><p>of my adventurous life. However, my far-famed </p><p>presence of mind and my cool head soon asserted </p><p>themselves, as was naturally to be expected of me. </p><p> “I knew the diameter of the moon to be 2,164</p><p>miles. A quick mental calculation proved that it </p><p>would take my falling body about 24 minutes to </p><p>reach the center of the moon. As there was nothing</p><p>to stop my fall. I must naturally continue to fall, due </p><p>to the tremendous momentum acquired, till my body </p><p>would have fallen for 48 minutes. If I could not </p><p>manage then to grasp a projecting rock, I would </p><p>commence to fall back again toward the center of the </p><p>moon. I reasoned that once more my momentum </p><p>would carry me past the center and I would then be </p><p>almost carried to the mouth of the opposite crater— </p><p>my original starting point. </p><p> “I say almost, for the friction of my body against</p><p>the air would tend to retard my fall. If at this point, </p><p>where my speed was again zero, I could not succeed </p><p>in taking hold of a projecting rock of the crater’s </p><p>side, I would begin to fall down once more, the same </p><p>as before. I would then continue falling back and </p><p>forward exactly like a bouncing ball, each time, how- </p><p>ever—just like a rubber ball—a little less than on the </p><p>previous plunge. Thus my drops would become of </p><p>shorter duration, and finally I would fall no more. </p><p> “As I had mentioned betore, the sun was almost</p><p>overhead, shining down into the crater. 1 also re- </p><p>membered that it was almost exactly 12 o’clock mid- </p><p>night, terrestrial time, when the meteor smashed my </p><p>aerial; this, then, was the time I started on my re- </p><p>markable journey into the bowels of the moon, with </p><p>a tremendous effort I pulled out my chronometer and </p><p>noted that it was 12.23 a. m. In another minute I </p><p>would fly past the center of the moon. Looking </p><p>about, I saw in the uncertain light that I went whizz- </p><p>ing through an immense hollow, proving to me that </p><p>the center of the moon was far from solid, due no </p><p>doubt to the centrifugal force of the moon at the </p><p>time when it had not solidified, some millions of </p><p>years ago. I estimated later that the moon was an </p><p>immense hollow sphere with a solid crust about 500 </p><p>miles thick. By way of a homely comparison, the </p><p>moon therefore must be a hollow globe like a rubber </p><p>ball. And like the latter, it is filled inside with air, </p><p>while its crust can be compared to the rubber of the </p><p>ball. </p><p> “In another minute I had passed the center and</p><p>was now dropping toward the other side of the moon. </p><p>If 1 continued falling in my present position. I must </p><p>naturally emerge at the opposite side with my feet </p><p>toward the sky, as a little reflection will reveal to you. </p><p>So once more I jerked my body about, and I was </p><p>falling-‘up,’ with my head at the top, my feet point- </p><p>ing to the sun. At the end of another 24 minutes I </p><p>could feel my body slowing up from the terrific </p><p>speed. As the crater at this side of the moon was </p><p>fortunately rather narrow, I found little difficulty </p><p>in reaching for a projecting rock as soon as my </p><p>plunge had come to a dead stop. I held on for dear </p><p>life and clambered up a narrow ledge, where I fell</p><p>down exhausted and panting from my dreadful ex- </p><p>perience. </p><p>ft\7’OU would, of course, like to know my sensa- </p><p>I tions in falling through 2.164 miles of space, </p><p>going over 16 miles per second at the center of the </p><p>moon. Well, the first minute it is rather unpleasant. </p><p>Highly so. The place where your stomach should be </p><p>by right is one vast area of nausea. But once you </p><p>become accustomed to it, it becomes bearable, for </p><p>there is nothing else to do. You might think that the </p><p>rush of air would kill you in a few seconds, or else </p><p>draw all the air out of your lungs, and thus asphyxi- </p><p>ate you. But neither is the case, for the air is so </p><p>thin on the moon that the rush is not as terrific as </p><p>it would be on earth. Also, by keeping the mouth </p><p>tightly shut and breathing—with difficulty, it is true </p><p>—through the nose, one does not die in 48 minutes. </p><p>The friction of the air against my body did not ignite </p><p>either, for, as I told you some time ago. the tempera- </p><p>ture inside the moon is near the absolute zero, the </p><p>awful cold of the stellar world. But neither did I </p><p>freeze to death, for the simple reason that the fric- </p><p>tion of my body through the attenuated air was just </p><p>sufficient to keep me comfortably warm. Thns you </p><p>see, that if it had not been so cold, I would have </p><p>burned up; and. if the friction of the air against </p><p>my body had not heated it. I would have frozen to </p><p>death long before I reached the center of the moon. </p><p>Then, too, another important point to consider is </p><p>that on the moon, as I explained before, my body </p><p>weighed 27 pounds, against 170 pounds on earth. </p><p>This is, of course, a rather small weight, and for that </p><p>reason my fall was not as terrible as it would have </p><p>BARON MUNCHHAUSFN </p><p>41 </p><p>been if my body had weighed 170 pounds, as it did </p><p>on earth. For that reason, too, 1 was not attracted </p><p>so much to the sides of the crater as 1 would have </p><p>been otherwise. Also it was fortunate that the two </p><p>craters widened out considerably the further down </p><p>they went into the moon's interior. As a matter of </p><p>fact, the 'hole’ of each crater at no point was less </p><p>than three miles in diameter. This was indeed very </p><p>lucky for me, for the following reason: </p><p> “If we drop a stone into a very deep and narrow</p><p>shaft, this stone will never reach the bottom, as has </p><p>been shown experimentally on earth. Instead, it will </p><p>bury itself in the eastern wall of the shaft long be- </p><p>fore it gets near the bottom, providing the shaft is </p><p>deep enough. The explanation is that the earth </p><p>rotates on its axis from west to east at a speed of </p><p>1,524 feet per second at the equator. Thus it is </p><p>apparent that the earth revolves more quickly than </p><p>the stone can fall in a few seconds.* It therefore </p><p>intercepts the stone’s flight, with the result that the </p><p>stone must of necessity strike the eastern wall of the </p><p>shaft. This phenomenon is termed ‘the falling of </p><p>a body toward east.’ </p><p> “Now, precisely the same condition exists on the</p><p>moon, of course. Fortunately, 1 started falling at </p><p>the western side of the crater, but as the latter was </p><p>so wide, I never came near enough to its eastern wall </p><p>to hit it. Likewise the other crater, at the opposite </p><p>side of the moon, measured some four miles in dia- </p><p>meter and. while I finally did reach the eastern wall, </p><p>my flight had come to an end as explained already. </p><p>Indeed, nature favored me all through, for the moon </p><p>rotates with a velocity of but 15 1-3 feet per second </p><p>at its equator, against a tangential speed of 1,524 </p><p>feet of the earth. For this reason there was no </p><p>danger that my body would collide with the sides </p><p>of the crater somewhere in the interior of the moon. </p><p> “But in the meanwhile my troubles were far from</p><p>being terminated. No sooner had I regained my </p><p>breath than I became conscious of the terrible cold; </p><p>for I was now but a few feet from the surface of the </p><p>moon, on that side which was turned away from the </p><p>sun, where only icy cold, darkness and desolation </p><p>reign. Aside from this, I was some 2,160 miles </p><p>away from Flitternix, my companion, and our ‘Inter- </p><p>stellar.’ Walking around half of the moon was out </p><p>of the question; neither could I stay where I was </p><p>without freezing to death. So I climbed up to the </p><p>surface of the moon with considerable effort. Then, </p><p>by the aid of the starlight. I ran rapidly around to </p><p>the western side of the crater, for I had to run in </p><p>order to keep warm. After having obtained my</p><p>bearings by the aid of the stellar constellations, to </p><p>make sure that I was at the western side of the </p><p>crater, I took a deep breath, looked down in the </p><p>abyss through which the sun was shining from the </p><p>other side, and dived head down into space once </p><p>more. </p><p> “You see, I had reasoned that it was far better</p><p>to attempt the flying journey through the moon once </p><p>more than to perish with the cold on the dark side of </p><p>the moon. Besides. I had experience now and. hav- </p><p>ing been successful once, it was natural that I should </p><p>expect success again. I had nothing whatever to </p><p>lose, and everything to gain. </p><p> “My first experience was repeated without any</p><p> * The speed of a falling body at the surface of the earth</p><p>after the first second is 16 1/12 feet. In six seconds a stone </p><p>would have traveled but 579 feet. </p><p>incident; furthermore. I calculated that I should land </p><p>at the eastern wall of the far crater within 48 min- </p><p>utes, if everything ran smoothly. But I had left </p><p>our good old sun out of my calculations. You see, </p><p>the gravitational attraction of the sun controlled the </p><p>fall of my body in the same proportion as it controls </p><p>the rotation of the moon, of the earth and of other </p><p>planets. I mentioned how, in my former flight, I </p><p>had risen to the top of the moon; as a matter of fact, </p><p>somewhat higher, for the opening of this crater was </p><p>higher than the surface of the moon. But now I </p><p>was falling toward the sun, and the sun was aiding </p><p>and accelerating my flight; for I moved constantly </p><p>nearer to it. </p><p> “For this reason, at the end of 48 minutes, I did</p><p>not strike the eastern end of the crater. Instead, I </p><p>whizzed right past the eastern wall, almost brushing </p><p>it, and continued to rise up into the air about 100 </p><p>feet, before my speed was spent. I promptly pre- </p><p>pared myself to plunge down into the crater again. </p><p>Indeed, before I realized it, I had begun to fall down </p><p>once more, when the unexpected happened. </p><p> “I suddenly felt a rope encircling my body, and</p><p>before 1 had time to think, I was jerked sideways, </p><p>In another second I had fallen on a heap of sand </p><p>and was looking with astonishment into Professor </p><p>Flit ter nix’s eyes! </p><p>tt^pl-IIS is what had happened: Flitternix had, </p><p>J. of course, seen me fall into the crater, and as </p><p>he had rushed to the edge, he had seen how I dropped </p><p>down with lightning speed. Looking closer, he also </p><p>noticed what I saw, namely, that the crater went right </p><p>through the entire mass of the moon, for he could </p><p>see the stars shining through from the other end. He</p><p>was loath to believe that the fall would kill me, and, </p><p>as a scientist of note, he calculated exactly, in ad- </p><p>vance, what was likely to happen to me. He re- </p><p>flected that it would take me some two hours to make </p><p>the round trip, as he knew that I could not possibly </p><p>stay at the other side of the moon. He reasoned, </p><p>correctly, that in case I was not killed, I would come </p><p>swinging through the crater in due time. Unper- </p><p>turbed as he is by such mere details, he went to the </p><p>'Interstellar' and had his lunch. Within two hours </p><p>he returned to the crater, armed with a telescope </p><p>and a long rope. It did not take him long to locate </p><p>me down in the abyss by means of his glass, for I </p><p>was rapidly coming to the surface then. Attaching </p><p>one end of the rope to a near-by rock, he fashioned </p><p>a sliding noose on the other side and waited. </p><p> “Now it must be said to the credit of Flitternix</p><p>that in his younger days he had lived in the West on </p><p>a ranch, and there had become an expert in the </p><p>science of lassoing, lie boasted that once he las- </p><p>soed a common sparrow by its left hind leg, but this </p><p>I believe to be somewhat exaggerated. Be that as </p><p>it may. When I finally emerged to the surface, a </p><p>living piece of lava ejected out of an extinct crater, </p><p>Flitternix had little trouble in lassoing me as I came </p><p>whizzing up. </p><p> “I thanked him and asked him if lunch was ready,</p><p>for the trip had given me quite an appetite, as you </p><p>may well imagine. Luncheon over, we decided right </p><p>then and there to quit the moon, for Flitternix, as </p><p>well as myself, were of the opinion that there was </p><p>little further to be explored on this dead world. </p><p>Besides, the meteors had become so alarmingly fre- </p><p>quent that it would be only a matter of time when </p><p>one or both of us would be killed. </p><p>42 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> “Flittcrnix wanted to return to earth at once, tor</p><p>he itched to give a lecture before the American As- </p><p>tronomical Society, whose honorary president he was. </p><p>i, however, had more ambitious plans. I once had </p><p>looked through the great telescope of the Lowell </p><p>Observatory at Flagstaff, Arizona;, If I live to be </p><p>a thousand years old, 1 will never forget the glorious </p><p>sight which then presented itself to my eyes. </p><p> “I saw a ball, lighted up dazzlingly at both ex-</p><p>tremities. i saw great patches of an ochre red scat- </p><p>tered over the surface of the sphere and I had seen </p><p>dark blue areas among the vast ochre patches. Over </p><p>the latter runs a mass of fine lines, nearly all of </p><p>them connecting with the white caps at each ex- </p><p>tremity. Moreover, these fine lines cause one to gasp </p><p>involuntarily, for they are as straight and true as if </p><p>laid out with a rule and pencil. More astonishing </p><p>yet, some of these lines run absolutely parallel with </p><p>other ones for the whole extent of their length. </p><p>And more wonderful still, whenever two or more </p><p>lines meet in a junction, there is invariably, a round </p><p>black spot. </p><p> “The ball which held me transfixed for a long time</p><p>was Mars, the nearest planet to earth, then 37.000,- </p><p>000	miles distant from your sphere. The late Prof.</p><p>Percival Lowell, the great authority on Martian re- </p><p>search work, had convinced the scientific world that </p><p>the dazzling white caps at the poles of this planet </p><p>are the polar snow fields. The great ochre patches </p><p>arc desert land, while the dark blue areas represent </p><p>large tracts of fertile land and its resulting vegeta- </p><p>tion. </p><p> “Now, according to well-known physical laws,</p><p>proved beyond discussion, the smaller a body, the </p><p>quicker it will cool off. All planets and their moons </p><p>once were white-hot like our sun. The smaller ones </p><p>cooled off first and the larger ones are not cold yet. </p><p>Thus the earth, which measures 7,912 miles in dia- </p><p>meter. is still red-hot in its interior, as is proved by </p><p>its active volcanoes. The moon, which is but 2.164 </p><p>miles through, cooled off ages ago. The oceans once </p><p>filling their beds then filtered down into its bowels, </p><p>there to freeze solid, for there was no heat to keep </p><p>the water fluid. Its atmosphere, which was formerly </p><p>as dense as that of our earth, was gradually thrown </p><p>off into space, till to-day practically no atmosphere </p><p>remains. Thus the moon rolls on through space, a </p><p>dead world. </p><p> “The planet Mars, measuring 4.339 miles in diam-</p><p>eter, as will be seen, is only twice the diameter of</p><p>our moon and much smaller than the earth. Con- </p><p>sequently it must be rapidly nearing its extinction, </p><p>just as the moon has done. Its oceans are already </p><p>dry, and most of its land is desert. Practically all </p><p>the atmosphere has gone too, which is proved by the </p><p>fact that we seldom observe clouds on Mars through </p><p>the telescope. Rut there must still be water on the </p><p>planet; this is irrefutably proved by its polar snow </p><p>caps. This view is further strengthened by the fact </p><p>that these caps undergo seasonal changes. As the </p><p>sun beats down upon them, we see first the one. then </p><p>the other, grow smaller in size, till at the end of the </p><p>Martian midsummer, the northern one has disap- </p><p>peared almost entirely. During the next hot season, </p><p>the same happens to the southern one. Where has </p><p>this water—the only remaining water on Mars— </p><p>gone? It cannot have filtered into the interior, for </p><p>if it had, we could not possibly witness the reap- </p><p>pearance of the polar snow fields every Martian year, </p><p>as we actually do. Where, then, does the water go? </p><p>f ( rv R. LOWELL solved the problem in a bril- </p><p> JL/ liant, as well as ingenious, manner.</p><p> “His view—and it is shared by most of our scien-</p><p>tists to-day—was that Mars is inhabited by a think- </p><p>ing people, fighting an heroic battle for their exist- </p><p>ence. Without water, life, as we know it, cannot </p><p>exist. Now, ages ago, the shortage of water had </p><p>made itself felt on Mars. Long before the first cave- </p><p>man appeared on earth, Mars had been an old world, </p><p>where civilized peoples had reigned for centuries. </p><p>While our ancestors were still jumping from limb to </p><p>limb among the trees in primordial forests and </p><p>jungles, the water problem on Mars had become </p><p>acute. The fertile lands were fast turning into </p><p>deserts, for rains had become more and more infre- </p><p>quent, until they had stopped almost entirely. Fur- </p><p>thermore, as Mars is flat, practically without moun- </p><p>tains of any sort, there could not be any natural </p><p>rivers to convey the water to the plains and valleys </p><p>as is the case on our world. The Martians, seeing </p><p>utter extermination staring them in the face, pro- </p><p>ceeded to save their race. They did precisely the </p><p>same thing that we are doing in Western America </p><p>and the Egyptians and English are doing in Egypt, </p><p>namely effecting the irrigation of deserts or semi- </p><p>deserts on a large scale. Our recent Roosevelt dam </p><p>in Arizona offera a good example of this. Our en- </p><p>gineers on earth have to bring the water to the </p><p>deserts, precisely as the Martian engineers must have </p><p>been doing for centuries past. </p><p> “On earth, however, this is a comparatively simple</p><p>matter, for here we have rivers and lakes in abun- </p><p>dance which can be tapped with ease. Not so on </p><p>Mars. The only remaining water there is found</p><p>around the poles; by sheer necessity, therefore, the </p><p>Martians had to go to the poles for their water </p><p>supply, and this is exactly what our telescopes reveal </p><p>that they did. For the long unswerving straight </p><p>lines which we see are part of the canals bringing </p><p>the water down from the poles to the desert land, </p><p>there to irrigate it. So far, the Lowell observatory </p><p>has discovered almost 6,000 canals, but there are </p><p>doubtless many more. They criss-cross the entire </p><p>surface of the planet in every conceivable direction. </p><p>Most of them, however, run due north and south in </p><p>the direction of the poles. Not only do the canals </p><p>cross the desert lands, but we see them carried bodily </p><p>across the dark blue areas which we know to be ir- </p><p>rigated vegetation tracts. The fact that the canals </p><p>run across these areas is another proof that these </p><p>areas are not oceans, as had been thought at one </p><p>time. </p><p> “Now, the lines which we see running over the</p><p>planet are really not the canals themselves, but are </p><p>simply wide strips of vegetation fertilized and kept </p><p>alive by the water from the canals. The average </p><p>width of the canals proper. Dr. Lowell estimated to </p><p>be about six miles. There are some of them, how- </p><p>ever, which are thought to be much wider than this. </p><p>The length of these canals, however, is stupendous. </p><p>There are some canals which actually measure 3,400 </p><p>miles in length. A great many are over 2,000 miles </p><p>long. Dozens of them run for 1,000 miles, and </p><p>nearly all of the canals run in absolutely straight </p><p>lines. </p><p> “The circular black areas, mentioned above, which</p><p>we see almost invariably at the juncture of one or </p><p>more canals, are termed ‘oases.’ They also represent </p><p>vast tracts of vegetation and probably contain large </p><p>cities, farms and so forth. </p><p>BARON MUNCHHAUSEN </p><p>43 </p><p> “Viewing Mars and its canals through a first class</p><p>telescope, must convince the strongest opponent of </p><p>Dr. Lowell's theory, that these wonderfully straight </p><p>lines cannot, by any possible chance, be the work of </p><p>Nature. The counterpart is found nowhere on earth, </p><p>nor in the heavens. And if, for argument's sake, we </p><p>consider these lines to be of natural origin, it is in- </p><p>conceivable that so many of them could join and </p><p>meet as they do and form these exact circular areas. </p><p>Their artificial origin is too apparent and cannot be </p><p>otherwise considered to-day. Dr. Lowell's theory </p><p>has so far withstood the onslaughts of nearly all op- </p><p>ponents. As a matter of fact, his explanation is to- </p><p>day accepted almost universally. </p><p> “But how do the Martians move the tremendous</p><p>masses of water through their canals? Mars is en- </p><p>tirely level, and water does not flow on a level sur- </p><p>face without a ‘head.’ Moreover, during one season </p><p>it must needs flow from the north towards the equa- </p><p>tor, when the northern polar snow cap melts under </p><p>the influence of the sun's heat. During the next sea- </p><p>son, however, this flow must be reversed, for now the </p><p>south polar snow cap melts with a resulting flow of </p><p>the water from the south to the north. </p><p> “But how do the Martians succeed in moving the</p><p>water? We don’t know. Even Professor Lowell </p><p>could tell us nothing on this point. Terrestrial </p><p>science simply has as yet not advanced enough to </p><p>offer an explanation. </p><p> “Well, to make a long story short, Flitternix and</p><p>I decided to voyage to Planet Mars. My little as- </p><p>tronomical lecture was given solely for the purpose </p><p>of refreshing your mind about Mars in order that </p><p>future reports which I shall make to you from the </p><p>planet may be better understood by you and your </p><p>friends. </p><p> “As long as our ‘Interstellar’ was able to succeed</p><p>in reaching the moon without mishap, I felt sure that </p><p>the trip to Mars would not be an unduly difficult un- </p><p>dertaking. Flitternix was of the same opinion. We </p><p>calculated that the intervening 50 million miles sepa- </p><p>rating the moon from Mars should be negotiated by </p><p>our space flyer in thirty days, barring accidents. </p><p>While this may seem like a short time in which to </p><p>cover such an immense distance, our speed of 1,- </p><p>600.000	miles a day, or 66,666 miles an hour, is only</p><p>a trifle greater than the speed of the earth (65,533 </p><p>miles an hour) as it travels in its orbit around the </p><p>sun. </p><p> “We immediately made our preparations and</p><p>within six hours after I had emerged from the </p><p>crater, the ‘Interstellar’ had left the moon. </p><p> “And now for a little surprise! No doubt you</p><p>noted that my voice does not sound the same as </p><p>usual. You will have observed, furthermore, that </p><p>I did not stop talking since I started. To break the </p><p>news gently to you. J am not talking at all! While </p><p>yon are listening to my voice at this minute, I am </p><p>some 1,100.000 miles distant from the moon, head- </p><p>ing towards Mars. </p><p> “The explanation? Simple as usual!</p><p> “Before leaving in our ‘Interstellar,’ we stretched</p><p>an immense aerial inside of the canyon, the one of </p><p>which I spoke to you several days ago. As you will </p><p>remember, T told you then that it was open but a </p><p>few feet across its opening at the top. It thus </p><p>formed a long, narrow slit at the top, into which </p><p>there was little likelihood of any meteor dropping, </p><p>which could destroy the aerial. Wre stretched four </p><p>wires in all along the inside of the canyon, spacing </p><p>the strands six feet apart. Each strand is 6,000 feet </p><p>long, which gives the required long wave length in </p><p>transmitting as well as receiving impulses between </p><p>Mars and the Moon, as well as between the Moon </p><p>and the Earth. </p><p> “To this aerial I connected my latest invention, my</p><p>Inter-Planetarian Kadiotornatic. It is nothing but </p><p>an ingenious adaptation of modern tele-mechanics </p><p>and works as follows: </p><p>“WHEN the aerial receives a certain number </p><p>VV of equally spaced dashes, an ultra-sensitive </p><p>vacuum tube detector is actuated, which in turn oper- </p><p>ates a gas-valve relay. This relay then oloses its </p><p>contacts, which sets in motion the well-known tele- </p><p>graphone, invented by Valdemar Poulsen, the Danish </p><p>Edison. A second ultra-sensitive detector, also con- </p><p>nected to the aerial, is in series with the registering </p><p>electro-magnets of the telegraphone; in front of these </p><p>magnets runs the moving steel wire, on which are </p><p>then recorded the impulses coming in over the aerial. </p><p>You will observe that no message can thus be re- </p><p>corded unless the original key dashes unlock the </p><p>telegraphone mechanism. At the end of the mes- </p><p>sage, the same number of equally spaced dashes will </p><p>lock the telegraphone mechanism. The recorded </p><p>message is now ready for re-transmission at any </p><p>time desired. This also is accomplished in a simple </p><p>manner. </p><p> “I took our 300-day clock and fastened upon it a</p><p>contact which would be closed at exactly 11 p. m.</p><p>every night and would be opened again at 12 o’clock </p><p>midnight. This contact closes a circuit in which is </p><p>included the telegraphone mechanism. As soon as it </p><p>starts, the steel wire with its recorded message be- </p><p>gins to reel off in front of the two reproducing elec- </p><p>tromagnets, which in turn are connected with a </p><p>special telephone receiver. Thus the telephone re- </p><p>ceiver will begin to talk its message (if one was sent </p><p>during the day) every evening at 11 o’clock. </p><p> “But connected to the telephone receiver are</p><p>several amplifiers, arranged in cascade. The last </p><p>amplifier is attached to the mouthpiece of the trans- </p><p>mitter of my wireless telephone. Thus the weakest </p><p>recorded talk on the telegraphone wire will cause </p><p>the telephone of the last amplifier to talk into the </p><p>wireless transmitter louder than myself. </p><p> “Now my 300-day clock every night at 11 o’clock</p><p>also closes the contacts of a powerful relay, which in </p><p>turn operates the generating plant of my wireless </p><p>telephone, disconnecting it at midnight. Therefore, </p><p>when the amplifier with its telephone begins to talk </p><p>into the transmitter of the wireless telephone, there </p><p>will always be enough power to transmit it to you </p><p>on Earth. </p><p> “As soon as we arrive on Mars, we will, in ail</p><p>probability, find all the necessary materials to erect </p><p>a giant radio telephone plant, and if we succeed we </p><p>will send daily messages to the Moon, and my radio- </p><p>tomatic relaying plant will transmit the messages to </p><p>you every night. I might also mention that my ultra- </p><p>sensitive detector contains two radio-active sub- </p><p>stances, making the detector such a marvelously </p><p>sensitive instrument that it will work a set of ampli- </p><p>fiers in cascade when an electric pocket buzzer is </p><p>operated one hundred and fifty miles away from it, </p><p>connected to the ground only and using no aerial! </p><p> “You might say: ‘Why use the relaying plant on</p><p>the Moon at all? Why not transmit from Mars to </p><p>the Earth directly?’ </p><p>41 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> “The reason is that when the weak impulses arrive</p><p>from Mars, after having traveled from 50 to 60 </p><p>million miles, they cannot be sufficiently strong to </p><p>pass through the Earth’s thick atmosphere which is </p><p>always charged with electricity and static. It is far </p><p>better that the weak impulses should operate the </p><p>relaying plant first and send out from it very strong </p><p>impulses which have to travel only some 238,000 </p><p>miles to Earth. </p><p> “We tested the plant thoroughly, and after we</p><p>had satisfied ourselves that it would work for at </p><p>least 300 days, I opened the telegraphone circuit </p><p>and began to register this message to you. It will </p><p>be the last one which you will receive for 30 days or </p><p>more. As it must take us from five to ten days to </p><p>build a transmitting plant on Mars, you need not </p><p>expect to hear from us for from 35 to 40 days. </p><p>You might, therefore, commence to ‘listen in’ be- </p><p>ginning with the 35th day from to-night. No mes- </p><p>sage can ever be repeated, for the ‘wiping’ electro- </p><p>magnets of the telegraphone wipe out the magnetic </p><p>impulses from the steel wire as quickly as they pass </p><p>the transmitting magnets. Neither can you trans- </p><p>mit a message to me, for no provisions were made </p><p>to relay your messages to us while on Mars. </p><p>“I will now bid you adieu, my boy. Think of us </p><p>during the next 30 days! Good-bye—good-bye .-. .!” </p><p>There was a silence for some seconds, and as I </p><p>was still listening awestruck, I was suddenly startled </p><p>by another voice: </p><p> “Hallo, there Alier, this is Professor Flitternix.</p><p>How's Yankton? Beastly old town. Was once </p><p>forced to sleep on a billiard table in the Palace Hotel, </p><p>as all the rooms were full. The robbers charged me </p><p>$2.50 for the ‘room,’ plus the regulation rate of 50 </p><p>cents an hour for the use of the billiard table! </p><p>Mean town, that Yankton! Well, good-bye . . .” </p><p>There was a snapping noise and the rhythmic, </p><p>low, sizzling sound stopped abruptly. All was quiet </p><p>once more. </p><p>6.	Munchhausen Lands on Mars.</p><p>FOR forty-one days I had been “listening in” </p><p>nightly at my wireless set, since that eventful </p><p>evening when Baron Munchhausen had left </p><p>the Moon for the planet Mars. He had said that it </p><p>would take from 35 to 40 days before the “Inter- </p><p>stellar’ could negotiate the trip from the Moon to </p><p>Mars, but nevertheless I became more and more im- </p><p>patient as the days wore on.</p><p> At last, on the evening of the forty-second day,</p><p>at 11 o’clock on the second, the peculiar, unmistak- </p><p>able high whining spark suddenly broke upon my </p><p>ears. After the long nervous strain, the loud whis- </p><p>tling spark almost took me off my feet and I could </p><p>hardly hear the first words for excitement. In a few </p><p>seconds the whistling sound died down, and Munch- </p><p>hausen’s dear, sepulchral voice sounded once more in </p><p>my faithful receivers. And how loud it was! It </p><p>was positively uncanny to think that I was listening </p><p>to his “canned” voice, which, perhaps 10 or 12 hours </p><p>before, had been hurled through the ether from Mars </p><p>55 millions miles to the Moon, there to be regis- </p><p>tered phonographically on a telegraphone wire. And </p><p>now the Baron’s voice through the radio telephone </p><p>sending plant on the Moon, 238,000 miles away from </p><p>me, was talking! The thought made me shiver. </p><p> “Hello, Alier,” it came in a sympathetic voice,</p><p>“how is old Mother Earth and yourself? Too bad </p><p>there is no return ‘circuit,’ for I would love to hear </p><p>your dear voice. It’s over 44 days since I last heard </p><p>it. But it can’t be helped. You must be satisfied to </p><p>listen to me, without being able to talk back; but </p><p>I’ll try to be as explicit as possible, so that you will </p><p>not feel the need of asking questions. </p><p> “Well, my boy, the trip from the Moon to Mars</p><p>was entirely uneventful. As soon as we had our </p><p>bearings, we made straight for the Red Planet, the </p><p>Mysterious. Flitternix and I took watches alter- </p><p>nately and. as we had learned from our former ex- </p><p>perience how to handle the 'Interstellar’ the trip </p><p>became more or less monotonous. We had a little </p><p>trouble at the start with the switching of the Mar- </p><p>conium netting, for it proved rather a puzzle to </p><p>perience how to handle the ‘Interstellar’ the trip </p><p>attractions of the Sun. the Earth and the Moon, and </p><p>at the same time have the planet Mars alone ‘puli’ </p><p>us. This bothered us considerably for several days </p><p>and we made little headway during that period. </p><p>Finally, when the Moon. Earth and Sun. in the order </p><p>named, were in a straight line, with Mars almost </p><p>overhead, our speed rapidly increased and on the </p><p>evening of the fourth day, the ‘Interstellar’ was en- </p><p>tirely gravity-insulated from the Moon. Earth and </p><p>Sun. We were then ‘falling’ towards Mars at the </p><p>rate of 20,000 miles an hour. Within 10 days our </p><p>speed had increased to over 50.000 miles an hour, </p><p>and the Earth, which from the Moon appeared 14 </p><p>times as large as the Moon appears to you. had </p><p>shrunk and shrunk till it looked like a small bright </p><p>red disc. Mars, in the meanwhile, became rapidly </p><p>larger and redder and soon it appeared like an ochre </p><p>disc. At the end of the thirty-fifth day, when our </p><p>speed had increased to 78.000 miles an hour, due to</p><p>the proximity of the planet, the Earth had become </p><p>a bright star in the firmament, somewhat brighter </p><p>than the other stars, but a pitiful sight compared </p><p>to what it had appeared when we saw it from the </p><p>Moon. Remember, the Moon is only 238,000 miles </p><p>distant from the Earth, while we were now over </p><p>50.000.000 miles away. Quite a little difference! </p><p> “The next day. the thirty-sixth since our start, we</p><p>were 200,000 miles distant from Mars, and the planet </p><p>at this distance was indeed the most gorgeous sight </p><p>either Flitternix or I had ever witnessed. Mars </p><p>looked now almost as big to us as the Earth looked </p><p>when viewed from the Moon. If the Earth was </p><p>then a wonderful spectacle, the planet Mars, w'hen </p><p>seen from such a small distance, is simply over- </p><p>whelming in its splendor. We saw a full red disc, </p><p>dazzlingly illuminated by the distant Sun’s rays. </p><p>Like the Earth, Mars has a pink fringe running </p><p>around the edge—its atmosphere. The continents </p><p>stand forth in an ochre red. intermingled with dark </p><p>green patches. Faint lines run over the entire face </p><p>of the planet, like cobwebs—the famous Martian </p><p>canals. At the top, a brilliant white cap is observed </p><p>—the north polar ice fields. </p><p> “But the most wonderful sight to us was Mars’</p><p>two little moons. Flitternix calls them toy moons. </p><p>We had the best view of these moons the next day, </p><p>when we were some 10.000 miles distant from Mars. </p><p>BARON MUNCHHAUSEN </p><p>45 </p><p> “The planet Mars has two tiny moons, christened</p><p>Phobos and Deimos by terrestrial astronomers. They </p><p>were discovered in 1877 by Professor Asaph liall, </p><p>of the Washington Observatory, and they were so </p><p>minute in size that only the most powerful telescopes </p><p>on Earth reveal them. The largest, Phobos. is about </p><p>36 miles in diameter, while the smaller, Deimos, is </p><p>only 10 miles in diameter. The latter is such a </p><p>ridiculously small world that a pedestrian could </p><p>walk around its equator in a single day! An auto- </p><p>mobile, given a fair road, could circle this entire </p><p>world in one hour, without exceeding the speed </p><p>limit! </p><p>f f D HOBOS, the larger moon, is less than 4,000 </p><p> 1	miles from the surface of Mars and revolves</p><p>around the latter in the remarkably short time of </p><p>7 hours and 39 minutes. Consequently, the Martians </p><p>witness the spectacle of their largest moon going </p><p>through all its phases in 7}^ hours! In a single </p><p>Martian morning, therefore, Phobos can be seen to </p><p>rapidly change from new moon to first quarter, then </p><p>full moon, then last quarter and finally again new </p><p>moon; and all this in 7/ hours! A unique feature </p><p>about Phobos. too, is that it revolves more quickly </p><p>around Mars than Mars revolves upon its own axis. </p><p>Mars turns around its axis in 24 hours, 37 minutes </p><p>and 22 seconds. Thus the Martian ‘day’ is almost </p><p>38 minutes longer than the terrestrial day. During </p><p>one Martian day, therefore, Phobos has spun more </p><p>than three times around Mars! As seen from Mars, </p><p>Phobos appears about as large as the Moon appears </p><p>to the inhabitants of the Earth. Deimos, the smaller </p><p>moon, is 12,300 miles distant from Mars. Whereas </p><p>its larger brother takes but I'/z hours to revolve </p><p>around Mars, Deimos requires 132 hours to complete </p><p>its circuit, or almost six days. However. Deimos is </p><p>so far removed from Mars, and it is such a tiny </p><p>object, that to the Martians it really does not appear </p><p>as a moon at all—at least not as we umlerstand that </p><p>term. For it must be apparent that if we view an </p><p>object measuring 10 miles across from a distance of </p><p>12,300 miles, we can hardly expect to see much. For </p><p>that reason. Deimos. when ‘full,’ appears only slightly </p><p>larger than the planet Venus appears to you as seen </p><p>from the Earth. Therefore the Martian nights arc </p><p>not brilliantly illuminated by two large moons, as </p><p>some writers would have you believe. On the con- </p><p>trary. the Martian night is very much like the ter- </p><p>restrial night, except that Phobos, when full, appears </p><p>to shed more light on Mars than the Moon sheds </p><p>on Earth. For the Martian atmosphere is consider- </p><p>ably thinner than the terrestrial one, and for that </p><p>reason it does not absorb so much light.</p><p> “After circling around Mars at a height of 10,000</p><p>miles for some time, we finally decided to make a </p><p>landing. By careful maneuvering and switching of </p><p>our anti-gravitational Marconium netting, we finally </p><p>descended to a height of but five miles from the </p><p>surface of Mars. On account of the etherless zone </p><p>of the Marconium netting when switched on, we </p><p>could not, of course, sec what was beneath us at </p><p>all times, for light does not pass through etherless </p><p>space. We had, therefore, only momentary glimpses </p><p>of the planet during the few seconds when the net- </p><p>ting was switched ofT. This constant switching on </p><p>and off of the current reduced our speed to almost </p><p>nothing. We were thus slowly approaching an open </p><p>plain which we had picked out and which appeared </p><p>like part of a desert: this was probably sandy enough </p><p>to elTect a soft landing of the ‘Interstellar.’ From </p><p>our momentary glimpses, we had become more than </p><p>convinced that the planet must indeed be inhabited </p><p>by intelligent creatures. We had snatched a good </p><p>view of a wonderfully built city; had seen sections </p><p>of the mysterious long waterways and their attend- </p><p>ing strips of vegetation, otherwise known as the </p><p>Martian canals, and had also observed ponderous </p><p>aircraft by the thousand and curious structures near </p><p>the canals that looked like gigantic pyramids. </p><p> “Had we still doubted that Mars was inhabited,</p><p>we were taught differently in a few minutes, for </p><p>things began to happen rapidly. </p><p> “When we were still about two miles from the</p><p>planet's surface, suddenly, as if by magic, everything </p><p>before our eyes became yellow. At the same time </p><p>a peculiar numb sensation came over our bodies and </p><p>we were hardly able to move hand or foot. Simul- </p><p>taneously, the machinery of the ‘Interstellar’ became </p><p>unmanageable, and, looking through the lower port- </p><p>holes, we could see that we were rapidly coming </p><p>closer to the planet’s surface, at the same time mov- </p><p>ing in a totally different direction from the one to </p><p>which we were heading originally. </p><p> “With some difficulty, we managed to look up</p><p>towards the top port windows and we saw a marvel- </p><p>ous sight. Three circular, massive structures, which </p><p>looked like metal aircraft, spaced equal distances </p><p>apart, were floating in space. The three flyers marked </p><p>an equilateral triangle while in the exact center, but </p><p>about one mile lower down than the flyers, our ‘Inter- </p><p>stellar' was floating. Three shafts of an intense </p><p>yellow ray were turned on us and it was this light, </p><p>or rather the peculiar properties of the rays, which </p><p>had made us captives to the Martians’ superior </p><p>intelligence. </p><p> “We reasoned that these floating forts must be</p><p>used for defensive purposes on Mars, and we agreed </p><p>among us tliat the best thing we could possibly do </p><p>wa$ to submit ourselves entirely to the Martians’ </p><p>will. Indeed, we were so helpless that wc could not </p><p>have offered any resistance, even had we wanted to </p><p>do so. Therefore, we calmly awaited developments, </p><p>for we reasoned instinctively that we would not be </p><p>harmed. Nor were we mistaken in this view. </p><p> “The yellow rays guided the ‘Interstellar over a</p><p>vast distance and at the end of an hour we were </p><p>gently deposited on a huge grassplot in a fairyland </p><p>‘city.’ The instant that our flyer’s broad landing </p><p>belt touched the ground, the yellow rays disappeared </p><p>and immediately our normal facilities were restored </p><p>once more. We were free to move and to act. </p><p> “We lost no time in unbolting our steel door, and</p><p>in our anxiety to get out in the open, all three of </p><p>us, Flitternix, myself and Buster, our Airedale ter- </p><p>rier, almost tumbled over each other. I admit that </p><p>on a historical occasion like this, the first time a </p><p>human being set foot on another planet, we should </p><p>have appeared more dignified as, for instance, Chris- </p><p>topher Columbus did when he first landed on San </p><p>SaKador. Sad to relate, however, there was noth- </p><p>ing dignified or solemn on the occasion of our land- </p><p>ing, and this was partly due to Buster. That in- </p><p>fernal dog insisted on running between our feet and </p><p>succeeded in tripping Flitternix just as he placed </p><p>his foot on the ground; if it had not been for me. he </p><p>would have sprawled all over the grass. </p><p> “It is a good thing that the Martians have a keen</p><p>sense of humor, for the crowd that had collected </p><p>around our flyer began to laugh uproariously in a </p><p>46 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>queer, characteristic Martian falsetto tone. 1 admit </p><p>that we offered a sufficient cause for amusement, </p><p>the professor in his old Prince Albert and myself </p><p>attired in my costume of 1797. However, we quickly </p><p>managed to pull ourselves together and we blinked </p><p>around us in unconcealed amazement. </p><p> “Although the Martian air is very much thinner</p><p>than the Earth's atmosphere, we experienced but </p><p>little trouble in breathing, for our stay in the rarefied </p><p>air of the Moon had taught us how to breathe in </p><p>thin air. We noticed immediately that the air was </p><p>very pure and we did not cough once, as was the </p><p>case of our landing on the Moon. The Martian air </p><p>seemed rich with ozone, and we could not rid our- </p><p>selves of the idea at first that we were breathing the </p><p>strong air of a pine forest. </p><p> “But the Martians themselves held us spellbound</p><p>for some minutes. 1 am not sure whether they were </p><p>not as much astonished as we were; for as we found </p><p>out later, the Martian can conceal his emotions far </p><p>better than the proverbial Indian. While I was still </p><p>staring open-mouthed at the nearest Martian, Flitter- </p><p>nix, who had recovered first from his surprise, </p><p>nudged me and said: ‘Didn’t I tell you?' </p><p>NLY then did I remember our discourse of </p><p>V/ the previous day, when we were speculating </p><p>together as to the probable appearance of the inhabi- </p><p>tants of Mars. I remember now that Flitternix had </p><p>said something like this: </p><p> “We have seen on Earth that animal life is pos-</p><p>sible under the most adverse conditions. We find </p><p>life at the North Pole in the most awful cold, and </p><p>we find life at the equator in the most intense </p><p>heat. We find life in the thinnest mountain air, and </p><p>we find life at the bottom of the ocean. The latter </p><p>is particularly interesting, because even up to a few </p><p>years ago, scientists of note denied that a fairly </p><p>large creature, such as a fish, could withstand the </p><p>enormous pressure of water at the bottom of an </p><p>ocean. For, the scientists argued, the fish would </p><p>be crushed to death by the thousands of tons of water </p><p>above it. Not only that, but they argued further </p><p>that, as it gets colder as one descends into the depths </p><p>of the ocean, the temperature finally drops below </p><p>the freezing point of fresh water. How, then, could </p><p>a fish live in such an abode? It was simply impos- </p><p>sible. The fish might just as well live in a frying </p><p>pan. The arguments were strong indeed against the </p><p>possibility of life at the bottom of the sea. </p><p> “But then the Challenger expedition came along</p><p>and carried on deep-sea dredging. No sooner had </p><p>this expedition begun to dredge, than they fished </p><p>from the bottom of the ocean, a most astounding </p><p>specimen of deep sea fish, built on a plan to with- </p><p>stand enormous pressures. True, it was dead when </p><p>it arrived at the surface of the ocean, but it was to </p><p>be expected, for as soon as the enormous pressure </p><p>to which the fish was accustomed was taken away, </p><p>he naturally burst inside. So our ‘wise’ scientists, </p><p>with their beautiful logic, were wrong once more and </p><p>the impossible, as always, was found to be very </p><p>much possible. </p><p> “I mention this only in passing, to show you that</p><p>life can accustom itself to almost any condition. </p><p>There are very few exceptions, indeed, to this rule, </p><p>it seems to me. Therefore, we have absolutely no </p><p>right to believe that the little planet Earth, among </p><p>the billions of the worlds, should be the only fortu- </p><p>nate one on which life thrives. Arrhennius has </p><p>demonstrated already how life is propagated from </p><p>one planet to another. This famous philosopher has </p><p>shown that minute life-carrying spores so small </p><p>that they cannot be seen by the naked eye, are car- </p><p>ried through space, propelled by the pressure of the </p><p>sunlight til) they strike another heavenly body. If </p><p>the conditions are suitable, the spore will germinate </p><p>in time and life will spring up—if it is not there </p><p>already—on that world. It has been proved that </p><p>these spores can exist in an absolute zero and in a </p><p>perfect vacuum for years, without losing their </p><p>germination power—another proof how nature pro- </p><p>tects life under almost unbelievable conditions. </p><p>Therefore, to say that there is life only on the Earth, </p><p>is not only idiotic in the extreme, but it also reveals </p><p>a total lack of appreciation of the wisdom of Al- </p><p>mighty Nature. </p><p> “Now, it is also an indisputable fact that plants,</p><p>animals and humans, too, are entirely dependent </p><p>upon their surroundings. If, for instance, you take </p><p>an Eskimo and transplant him and his family on an </p><p>island under the equator, his light color will change </p><p>into black in a few generations. Likewise evolution </p><p>shows that the human body very quickly adapts itsel f </p><p>to the tasks imposed upon it. Thus a man whose </p><p>grandfather and father were hard-working laborers, </p><p>will nine times out of ten inherit a bony as well as </p><p>robust body and a relatively small brain. Whereas </p><p>a man whose grandfather and father were mathe- </p><p>maticians, nine times out of ten will have a compara- </p><p>tively small-boned body, which is far from robust, </p><p>but his brain will be large. </p><p> “Surroundings are everything, and given time they</p><p>will transform man or animal into different beings. </p><p> “Now let us apply this reasoning to Mars and let</p><p>us see what we will find. To begin, it has been </p><p>proved beyond dispute that Mars has an atmosphere, </p><p>which, although thinner than that of the Earth, is </p><p>probably thick enough to sustain human life, even </p><p>as we know it. Professor Lowell has proved that </p><p>the mean temperature on Mars is about 47 degrees </p><p>Fahrenheit. In some sections, near the equator, for </p><p>instance, the temperature can be less than 65 de- </p><p>grees Fahrenheit. It was argued in former years </p><p>that, on account of the far greater distance Mars is </p><p>removed from the Sun than the Earth, the tempera- </p><p>ture must be far below zero. Recent astronomical </p><p>researches, however, completely disproved this. As </p><p>a matter of fact. Mars proper receives really more </p><p>heat than does the Earth, for the following reasons: </p><p>The Martian atmosphere is much thinner than the </p><p>terrestrial, consequently the Sun’s rays pierce it </p><p>with far less loss than is the case on Earth. Then, </p><p>too, there are no clouds on Mars to cut off almost </p><p>50 per cent of the received Sun’s rays, as is the </p><p>actual case on Earth. </p><p> “Then again, the Martian day is almost exactly</p><p>as long as the terrestrial. Also due to the inclination </p><p>of the Martian axis, which is almost exactly the same </p><p>as that of the Earth, the seasons are like the ter- </p><p>restrial ones except that they are twice as long, </p><p>because the Martian year is just twice as long as the </p><p>terrestrial one. </p><p> “Now, we know that the planet Mars, due to its</p><p>small size, has an older life history than the Earth. </p><p>Civilization on Mars must date back several hundred </p><p>thousand years. The law of evolution teaches us </p><p>that we must therefore expect a very cultured, as </p><p>well as accomplished race. </p><p> "As our terrestrial evolution shows, the human</p><p>BAKON MUNCHHAUSEN </p><p>47 </p><p>head is growing larger and larger all the time. It </p><p>must have been the same on Mars, for conditions </p><p>there are almost the same as on Earth. We must, </p><p>therefore, expect to find a race with enormous heads. </p><p>As the air is thinner on Mars, sound will not carry </p><p>as well as in a thicker atmosphere. Therefore, we </p><p>must expect big funnel-like ears on the Martians, </p><p>and since a big head almost invariably has big eyes, </p><p>we may safely deduce that the Martians have large </p><p>eyes. But there is one important difference of physi- </p><p>cal conditions on Mars, as compared with those on </p><p>Earth—namely gravitation. For what weighs one </p><p>pound on Earth weighs but 0.38 pound, or a little </p><p>over one-third pound, on Mars. Less bodily weight </p><p>makes for excessive growth, for the reason that </p><p>gravity pulls less on the body frame. A little cal- </p><p>culation. based upon the above gravitational figures, </p><p>leads us to suspect that the average Martian should </p><p>mals breathe through their noses as a rule. </p><p> “As to the Martians’ hands, it is probable we will</p><p>find them rather small in proportion to the rest of </p><p>the body. The Martians have probably advanced so </p><p>far that manual labor has been abolished for hun- </p><p>dreds of generations. It is almost certain that as </p><p>everything must be done with machinery, manual </p><p>labor is absolutely unknown today on Mars. This </p><p>naturally, in the course of several thousand years, </p><p>begins to tell and the hands must shrink. We may </p><p>therefore expect that the eight-foot Martian has a </p><p>hand rather smaller than ours. Again, as no physi- </p><p>cal labor of any sort is performed by the Martian, </p><p>his arms are probably thin and muscleless. </p><p> “As to his feet, we shall, in all probability, find</p><p>them to be very large. They must support a tall and </p><p>rather heavy body, and they must, therefore, provide </p><p>sufficient area to enable the Martian to walk prop- </p><p> Our friend, the Baron, is quite impressed by the canals of Mars, and it would seem to be no wonder, when we examine the illustra-</p><p> tions above, which we have Just received from the Lowell Observatory at Flaggstaff, Arizona, giving us the latest telescopic views of the</p><p> planet. It will be seen that the canals, in many cases practically straight, or are almost on the great circles of the planet, suggesting</p><p> very strongly artificial construction, while some of them which are curved, are so regularly placed as to emphasize the idea that they</p><p>were constructed by inteUigent beings. </p><p>be about eight feet tall. As the sunlight is very </p><p>much stronger on account of the thin air on Mars, </p><p>the Martian, unless he is in the shade most of the </p><p>time, probably has a dark skin, which may be as</p><p>red as that of a North American Indian or as dark </p><p>as that of a West Indian. </p><p> “As the air is so thin on Mars and as oxygen is</p><p>needed in large quantities for such big bodies as the </p><p>Martians, we will not be surprised to find that the </p><p>Martian has an immense torso, to accommodate his </p><p>ponderous lungs. The latter must be doubly large </p><p>in order to sustain such a large body and also to </p><p>work over quickly the small volume of oxygen in </p><p>the thin air. But large lungs also invariably require </p><p>a large nose, as we know from experience on earth. </p><p>Consequently, if the Martians have a ponderous nose, </p><p>don’t be surprised, for evolution shows us that ani- </p><p>erly. Also, the feet must be large on account of </p><p>Mars’ small gravitational attraction, for if the Mar- </p><p>tian’s feet were small, he could not secure the proper </p><p>foothold to propel his body; he would be hopping, </p><p>instead of walking. </p><p> “Therefore, when we behold the first Martian, we</p><p>will probably find him totally different in looks from </p><p>a human being, and while my reasoning as to his </p><p>probable appearance may be inaccurate in spots, I </p><p>am sure that on the whole I will be correct.” </p><p>f£QO spoke Flitternix. </p><p> O	“He was right, marvelously right.

The former held undisputed </p><p>sway for eons, but gave way eventually before the </p><p>smaller, but intellectually superior mammals. Man </p><p>himself, the supreme example of the ability of life </p><p>to govern and control inanimate matter, was master </p><p>of the world with apparently none to dispute his </p><p>right. Yet, so blinded was he with pride over the </p><p>continued exercise of his power on Earth over other </p><p>lower types of mammals and the nearly extinct </p><p>reptiles, that he failed to notice the slow but steady </p><p>rise of another branch of life, different from his </p><p>own; smaller, it is true, but no smaller than he had </p><p>been in comparison with the mighty reptilian mon- </p><p>sters that roamed the swamps in Mesozoic times. </p><p> These new enemies of man, though seldom attack-</p><p>ing him personally, threatened his downfall by de- </p><p>stroying his chief means of sustenance, so that by </p><p>the close of the twentieth century, strange and dar- </p><p>ing projects were laid before the various govern- </p><p>ments of the world with an idea of fighting man’s </p><p>insect enemies to the finish. These pests were grow- </p><p>ing in size, multiplying so rapidly and destroying </p><p>so much vegetation, that eventually no plants would </p><p>be left to sustain human life. Humanity suddenly </p><p>woke to the realization that it might suffer the fate </p><p>of the nearly extinct reptiles. Would mankind be </p><p>able to prevent the encroachment of the insects? </p><p>And at last man knew that unless drastic measures </p><p>were taken at once, a third great class of life was </p><p>on the brink of terrestrial sovereignty. </p><p> Of course no great changes in development come</p><p>suddenly.

Have we learned more and more of truth and </p><p>of the laws that control matter only to succumb to </p><p>the first real danger that threatens us with extermi- </p><p>nation? Surely, no matter what the cost, you will </p><p>rally to the solution of our problem, and I believe, </p><p> friends, that I have discovered the answer to the</p><p>enigma. </p><p> “I know that many of you, like my friend Pro-</p><p>fessor Fair, will believe my ideas too extreme, but </p><p>I	am convinced that unless you are willing to put</p><p>behind you those notions which are old and not </p><p>utilitarian, you cannot hope to cope with the present </p><p>situation. </p><p> “Already, in the past few decades, you have real-</p><p>ized the utter futility of encumbering yourselves </p><p>with superfluous possessions that had no useful vir- </p><p>tue, but which, for various sentimental reasons, you </p><p>continued to hoard, thus lessening the degree of your </p><p>life’s efficiency by using for it time and attention </p><p>that should have been applied to the practical work </p><p>of life’s accomplishments. You have given these </p><p>things up slowly, but I am now going to ask you to </p><p>relinquish the rest of them quickly; everything that </p><p>interferes in any way with the immediate disposal </p><p>of our enemies, the insects.” </p><p> At this point, it seems that my worthy ancestor,</p><p>Professor Fair, objected to the scientist’s words, </p><p>asserting that efficiency at the expense of some of </p><p>the sentimental virtues was undesirable and not </p><p>conducive to happiness, the real goal of man. The </p><p>scientist, in his turn, argued that happiness was </p><p>available only through a perfect adaptability to one’s </p><p>environment, and that efficiency sans love, mercy </p><p>and the softer sentiments was the short cut to </p><p>human bliss. </p><p> It took a number of years for the scientist to put</p><p>over his scheme of salvation, but in the end he </p><p>succeeded, not so much from the persuasiveness of</p><p>his words, as because prompt action of some sort </p><p>was necessary. There was not enough food to </p><p>feed the people of the earth. Fruit and vegetables </p><p>were becoming a thing of the past. Too much pro- </p><p>tein food in the form of meat and fish was injuring </p><p>the race, and at last the people realized that, for </p><p>fruits and vegetables, or their nutritive equivalent, </p><p>they must turn from the field to the laboratory: </p><p>from the farmer to the chemist. Synthetic food </p><p>was the solution to the problem. There was no </p><p>longer any use in planting and caring for food stuffs </p><p>destined to become the </p><p>nourishment of man’s </p><p>most deadly enemy. </p><p> The last planting took</p><p>place in 2900, but there </p><p>was no harvest, the vora- </p><p>cious insects took every </p><p>green shoot as soon as it </p><p>appeared, and even trees, </p><p>that had previously with- </p><p>stood the attacks of the </p><p>huge insects, were by this </p><p>time, stripped of every </p><p>vestige of greenery. </p><p> The vegetable world suddenly ceased to exist.</p><p>Over the barren plains which had been gradually </p><p>filling with vast cities, man-made fires brought dev- </p><p>astation to every living bit of greenery, so that in </p><p>all the world there was no food for the insect pests. </p><p> CHAPTER II</p><p> Man or Insect?</p><p>Extract front the diary of Delfair, a descendant of </p><p>Professor Fair, zvho had opposed the daring scientist. </p><p> OUR readers will remember the author of this story</p><p> as the third price winner in our $500.00 price contest</p><p> last year.

Many of us realized that Earth </p><p>was no longer beautiful; but if beauty meant death; </p><p>better life in the sterility of the metropolis. </p><p> The viciousness of the thwarted insects was a</p><p>menace that we had foreseen and yet failed to take </p><p>into adequate account. On the city-state borderland, </p><p>life is constantly imperiled by the attacks of well </p><p>organized l&gt;odies of our dreaded foe. </p><p> (Note: The organization that now exists among</p><p>the ants, bees and other insects, testifies to the pos- </p><p>sibility of the development of military tactics among </p><p>them in the centuries to come.) </p><p> Robbed of their source of food, they have become</p><p>emboldened to such an extent that they will take any </p><p>risks to carry human beings away for food, and after </p><p>one of their well organized raids, the toll of human </p><p>life is appalling. </p><p> But the great chemical laboratories where our syn-</p><p>thetic food is made, and our oxygen plants, we </p><p>thought were impregnable to their attacks. In that </p><p>we were mistaken. </p><p> Let me say briefly that since the destruction of all</p><p>vegetation which furnished a part of the oxygen </p><p>essential to human life, it became necessary to manu- </p><p>facture this gas artificially for general diffusion </p><p>through the atmosphere. </p><p> 1 was flying to my work, which is in Oxygen Plant</p><p>No. 21, when I noticed a peculiar thing on the upper </p><p>speedway near Food Plant No. 3,439. Although it </p><p>was night, the various levels of the state-city were </p><p>illuminated as brightly as by day. A pleasure vehicle </p><p>was going with prodigious speed westward. I looked </p><p>after it in amazement. It was unquestionably the </p><p>car of Eric, my co-worker at Oxygen Plant No. 21. </p><p>I recognized the gay color of its body, but to verify </p><p>my suspicions beyond the question of a doubt, I </p><p>turned my volplane in pursuit and made out the fa- </p><p>miliar license number. What was Eric doing away </p><p>from the plant before I had arrived to relieve him </p><p>from duty? </p><p> In hot pursuit, I sped above the car to the very</p><p>border of the state-city, wondering what unheard of</p><p>errand took him to the land of the enemy, for the </p><p>car came to a sudden stop at the edge of what had </p><p>once been an agricultural area. Miles ahead of me </p><p>stretched an enormous expanse of black sterility; at </p><p>my back was the teeming metropolis, five levels high </p><p>—if one counted the hangar-level, which did not </p><p>cover the residence sections. </p><p> I had not long to wait, for almost immediately my</p><p>friend appeared. What a sight he presented to my </p><p>incredulous gaze! He was literally covered from </p><p>head to foot with the two-inch ants, that next to the </p><p>beetles, had proved the greatest menace in their at- </p><p>tacks upon humanity. With wild incoherent cries he </p><p>fled over the rock and stubble-burned earth. </p><p> As soon as my stunned senses permitted, I</p><p>swooped down toward him to effect a rescue, but </p><p>even as my plane touched the barren earth, I saw&gt; </p><p>that I was too late, for he fell, borne down by the </p><p>vicious attacks of his myriad foes. I knew it was </p><p>useless for me to set foot upon the ground, for my </p><p>fate would l&gt;e that of Eric. I rose ten feet and seiz- </p><p>ing my poison-gas weapon, let its contents out upon </p><p>the liny black evil things that swarmed below. I did </p><p>not bother with my mask, for I planned to rise im- </p><p>mediately, and it was not a moment too soon. From </p><p>across the waste-land, a dark cloud eclipsed the stars </p><p>and I saw coming toward me a horde of flying ants </p><p>interspersed with larger flying insects, all bent upon </p><p>my annihilation. I now took my mask and prepared </p><p>to turn more gas upon my pursuers, but alas, I had </p><p>used every atom of it in my attack upon the non- </p><p>flying ants! I had no recourse but flight, and to this </p><p>I immediately resorted, knowing that I could outdis- </p><p>tance my pursuers. </p><p> When 1 could no longer see them, I removed my</p><p>gas mask. A suffocating sensation seized me. I </p><p>could not breathe! How high had I flown in my </p><p>endeavor to escape the flying ants? I leaned over the </p><p>side of my plane, expecting to see the city far, far </p><p>below me. What was my utter amazement when I </p><p>discovered that I was scarcely a thousand feet high! </p><p>It was not altitude that was depriving me of the life- </p><p>giving oxygen. </p><p> A drop of three hundred feet showed me inert</p><p>specks of humanity lying about the streets. Then I </p><p>knew; the oxygen plant mis not in operation! In </p><p>another minute 1 had on my oxygen mask, which was </p><p>attached to a small portable tank for emergency use, </p><p>and I rushed for the vicinity of the plant. There I </p><p>witnessed the first signs of life. Men equipped with </p><p>oxygen masks, were trying to force entrance into the </p><p>locked building. Being an employee, I possessed </p><p>knowledge of the combination of the great lock, and</p><p>I opened the door, only to be greeted by a swarm ol </p><p>ants that commenced a concerted attack upon us. </p><p> The floor seemed to be covered with a moving</p><p>black rug. the corner nearest the door appearing </p><p>to unravel as we entered, and it was but a few </p><p>seconds before we were covered with the clinging, </p><p>biting creatures, who fought with a supernatural </p><p>energy born of despair. Two very active ants </p><p>succeeded in getting under my helmet. The bite </p><p>of their sharp mandibles and the effect of their </p><p>poisonous formic acid became intolerable. Did I </p><p>dare remove my mask while the air about me was </p><p>foul with the gas discharged from the weapons of </p><p>my allies? While I felt the attacks elsewhere upon </p><p>my body gradually diminishing as the insects suc- </p><p>cumbed to the deadly fumes, the two upon my face </p><p>waxed more vicious under the protection of my </p><p>mask. One at each eye, they were trying to blind </p><p>me. The pain was unbearable. Better the suffo- </p><p>cating death-gas than the torture of lacerated eyes! </p><p>Frantically I removed the head-gear and tore at </p><p>the shiny black fiends. Strange to tell, I discovered </p><p>that I could breathe near the vicinity of the great </p><p>oxygen tanks, where enough oxygen lingered to </p><p>support life at least temporarily. The two vicious </p><p>insects, no longer protected by my gas-mask, scur- </p><p>ried from me like rats from a sinking ship and dis- </p><p>appeared behind the oxygen tanks. </p><p> This attack of our enemies, though unsuccessful'</p><p>on their part, was dire in its significance, for it had </p><p>shown more cunning and ingenuity than anything </p><p>that had ever preceded it. Heretofore, their on- </p><p>slaughts had been confined to direct attacks upon </p><p>us personally or upon the synthetic-food lal&gt;orato- </p><p>ries. but in this last raid they had shown an amazing </p><p>cleverness that portended future disaster, unless they </p><p>were checked at once. It was obvious they had in- </p><p>geniously planned to smother us by the suspension </p><p>THE MIRACLE OF THE LILY </p><p>51 </p><p>of work at the oxygen plant, knowing that they </p><p>themselves could exist in an atmosphere containing </p><p>a greater percentage of carbon-dioxide. Their </p><p>scheme, then, was to raid our laboratories for food. </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>.Lucanus the Last </p><p>A Continuation of Dclfair’s Account </p><p>ALTHOUGH it was evident that the cessation </p><p>of all plant-life spelled inevitable doom for </p><p>. the insect inhabitants of Earth, their exter- </p><p>mination did not follow as rapidly as one might </p><p>have supposed. There were years of internecine </p><p>warfare. The insects continued to thrive, though in </p><p>decreasing numbers, upon stolen laboratory foods, </p><p>bodies of human-beings and finally upon each other; </p><p>at first capturing enemy species and at last even </p><p>resorting to a cannibalistic procedure. Their rapacity </p><p>grew in inverse proportion to their waning num- </p><p>bers, until the meeting of even an isolated insect </p><p>might mean death, unless one were equipped with </p><p>poison gas and prepared to use it upon a second's </p><p>notice. </p><p> I am an old man now, though I have not yet lived</p><p>quite two centuries, but I am happy in the knowledge </p><p>that I have lived to see the last living insect which </p><p>was held in captivity. It was an excellent specimen </p><p>of the stag-beetle (Lucanus) and the years have </p><p>testified that it was the sole survivor of a form of </p><p>life that might have succeeded man upon this planet. </p><p>This beetle was caught weeks after we had pre- </p><p>viously seen what was supposed to be the last living </p><p>thing upon the globe, barring man and the sea-life. </p><p>Untiring search for years has failed to reveal any </p><p>more insects, so that at last man rests secure in the </p><p>knowledge that he is monarch of all he surveys. </p><p> I have heard that long, long ago man used to</p><p>gaze with a fearful fascination upon the reptilian </p><p>creatures which he displaced, and just so did he </p><p>view this lone specimen of a type of life that might </p><p>have covered the face of the earth, but for man’s </p><p>ingenuity. </p><p> It was this unholy lure that drew me one day to</p><p>view the captive beetle in his cage in district 404 </p><p>at Universapolis. I was amazed at the size of the </p><p>creature, for it looked larger than when I had seen </p><p>it by television, but I reasoned that upon that occa- </p><p>sion there had been no object near with which to </p><p>compare its size. True, the broadcaster had an- </p><p>nounced its dimensions, but the statistics concretely</p><p>given had failed to register a perfect realization of </p><p>its prodigious proportions. </p><p> As 1 approached the cage, the creature was lying</p><p>with its dorsal covering toward me and I judged </p><p>it measured fourteen inches from one extremity to </p><p>the other. Its smooth horny sheath gleamed in the </p><p>bright artificial light. (It was confined on the third </p><p>level.) As I stood there, mentally conjuring a pic- </p><p>ture of a world overrun with billions of such crea- </p><p>tures as the one before me, the keeper approached </p><p>the cage with a meal-portion of synthetic food. Al- </p><p>though the food has no odor, the beetle sensed the </p><p>man’s approach, for it rose on its jointed legs and </p><p>came toward us, its horn-like prongs moving threat- </p><p>eningly; then apparently remembering its confine- </p><p>ment, and the impotency of an attack, it subsided </p><p>and quickly ate the food which had been placed </p><p>within its prison. </p><p> The food consumed, it lifted itself to its hind</p><p>legs, partially supported by a box. and turned its </p><p>great eyes upon me. I had never been regarded </p><p>with such utter malevolence before. The detestation </p><p>was almost tangible and I shuddered involuntarily. </p><p>As plainly as if he spoke, I knew that Lucanus was </p><p>perfectly cognizant of the situation and in his gaze </p><p>I read the concentrated hate of an entire defeated </p><p>race. </p><p> I had no desire to gloat over his misfortune, rather</p><p>a great pity toward him welled up within me. I pic- </p><p>tured myself alone, the last of my kind, held up for </p><p>ridicule before the swarming hordes of insects who </p><p>had conquered my people, and I knew that life </p><p>would no longer be worth the living. </p><p> Whether he sensed my pity or not I do not know,</p><p>but he continued to survey me with unmitigated </p><p>rage, as if he would convey to me the information </p><p>that his was an impacable hatred that would outlast </p><p>eternity. </p><p> Not long after this he died, and a world long</p><p>since intolerant of ceremony, surprised itself by </p><p>interring the beetle’s remains in a golden casket, </p><p>accompanied by much pomp and.splendor. </p><p> I have lived many long years since that memor-</p><p>able event, and undoubtedly my days here are num- </p><p>bered, but I can pass on happily, convinced that in </p><p>this sphere man’s conquest of his environment is </p><p>supreme. </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>Efficiency Maximum </p><p>hi a direct line of descent from Professor Fair and</p><p>Delfair, the author of the preceding chapter, comes </p><p> Tlianor zvhose journal is given in this chapter.</p><p>AM T a true product of the year 2928? Some- </p><p>times T am convinced that I am hopelessly </p><p>. old-fashioned, an anachronism, that should </p><p>have existed a thousand years ago. In no other </p><p>way can I account for the dissatisfaction 1 feel in </p><p>a world where efficiency has at last reached a </p><p>maximum. </p><p> I am told that I spring from a line of ancestors</p><p>who were not readily acclimated to changing con- </p><p>ditions. I love beauty, yet I see none of it here. </p><p>There are many who think our lofty buildings that </p><p>tower two and three thousand feet into the air are </p><p>beautiful, but while they are architectural splendors, </p><p>they do not represent the kind of loveliness I crave. </p><p>Only when I visit the sea do I feel any satisfaction </p><p>for a certain yearning in my soul. The ocean alone </p><p>shows the handiwork of God. The land bears evi- </p><p>dence only of man. </p><p> As I read back through the diaries of my senti-</p><p>mental ancestors I find occasional glowing descrip- </p><p>tions of the world that was; the world before the </p><p>insects menaced human existence. Trees, plants and </p><p>flowers brought delight into the lives of people as </p><p>they wandered among them in vast open spaces, 1 </p><p>am told, where the earth was soft beneath the feet, </p><p>and flying creatures, called birds, sang among the </p><p>greenery. True, I learn that many people had not </p><p>enough to eat, and that uncontrollable passions gov- </p><p>erned them, but I do believe it must have been more </p><p>interesting than this methodical, unemotional exist- </p><p>ence. I can not understand why many people were </p><p>poor, for I am told that Nature as manifested in </p><p>52 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>the vegetable kingdom was very prolific; so much </p><p>so that year after year quantities of food rotted on </p><p>the ground. The fault, 1 find by my reading, was </p><p>not with Nature but with man’s economic system </p><p>which is now perfect, though this perfection really </p><p>brings few of us happiness, I think. </p><p> Now there is 110 waste; all is converted into food.</p><p>Long ago man learned how to reduce all matter to </p><p>its constituent elements, of which there are nearly </p><p>a hundred in number, and from them to rebuild </p><p>compounds for fowl. The old axiom that nothing </p><p>is created or destroyed, but merely changed from </p><p>one form to another, has stood the test of ages. </p><p>Man. as the agent of God, has simply performed </p><p>the miracle of transmutation himself instead of wait- </p><p>ing for natural forces to accomplish it as in the </p><p>old days. </p><p> At first humanity wras horrified when it was de-</p><p>creed that it must relinquish its dead to the labora- </p><p>tory. For too many eons had man closely asso- </p><p>ciated the soul and body, failing to comprehend </p><p>the body as merely a material agent, through which </p><p>the spirit functioned. When man knew at last of </p><p>the eternal qualities of spirit, he ceased to regard </p><p>the discarded body with reverential awe, and sawr in </p><p>it only the same molecular constituents which com- </p><p>prised all matter about him. He recognized only </p><p>material basically the same as that of stone or metal; </p><p>material to lie reduced to its atomic elements and </p><p>rebuilt into matter that would render service to liv- </p><p>ing humanity; that portion of matter wherein spirit </p><p>functions. </p><p> The drab monotony of life is appalling. Is it</p><p>possible that man had reached his height a thousand </p><p>years ago and should have been willing to resign </p><p>Earth’s sovereignty to a coming order of creatures </p><p>destined to be man’s worthy successor in the eons </p><p>to come? It seems that life is interesting only when </p><p>there is a struggle, a goal to be reached through an </p><p>evolutionary process. Once the goal is attained, all </p><p>progress ceases. The huge reptiles of preglacial </p><p>ages rose to supremacy by virtue of their great size, </p><p>and yet was it not the excessive bulk of those crea- </p><p>tures that finally wiped them out of existence? </p><p>Nature, it seems, avoids extremes. She allows the </p><p>fantastic to develop for awhile and then wipes the </p><p>slate clean for a new order of development. Is it </p><p>not conceivable that man could destroy himself </p><p>through excessive development of his nervous system, </p><p>and give place for the future evolution of a com- </p><p>paratively simple form of life, such as the insects </p><p>were at man’s height of development? This, it</p><p>seems to me, was the great plan; a scheme with </p><p>which man dared to interfere and for which lie is </p><p>now paying by the boredom of existence. </p><p> The earth's population is decreasing so rapidly,</p><p>that I fear another thousand years will see a life- </p><p>less planet hurtling through space. It seems to me </p><p>that only a miracle will save us now. </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>The Year 3928 </p><p>The Original Writer, Nathano, Resumes </p><p>the Narrative </p><p>MY ancestor. Thanor, of ten centuries ago, </p><p>according to the records he gave to my </p><p>great grandfather, seems to voice the gen- </p><p>eral despair of humanity which, bad enough in his </p><p>times, lias reached the nth power in my day. A </p><p>soulless world is gradually dying from self-inflicted </p><p>boredom. </p><p> As I have ascertained from the perusal of the</p><p>journals of my forebears, even antedating the ex- </p><p>termination of the insects, I come of a stock that </p><p>clings with sentimental tenacity to the things that </p><p>made life worth while in the old days. If the world </p><p>at large knew of my emotional musings concerning </p><p>past ages, it would scarcely tolerate me, but surT </p><p>rounded by my thought-insulator, I often indulge </p><p>in what fancies I will, and such meditation, coupled </p><p>with a love for a few ancient relics from the past, </p><p>have led me to a most amazing discovery. </p><p> Several months ago I found among my family</p><p>relics a golden receptacle two feet long, one and </p><p>a half in width and one in depth, which I found, </p><p>upon opening, to contain many tiny square com- </p><p>partments, each filled with minute objects of slightly </p><p>varying size, texture and color. </p><p> “Not sand!” I exclaimed as I closely examined</p><p>the little particles of matter. </p><p> Food? After eating some, T was convinced that</p><p>their nutritive value was small in comparison with </p><p>a similar quantity of the products of our laboratories. </p><p>What were the mysterious objects? </p><p> Just as I was about to close the lid again, con-</p><p>vinced that I had one over-sentimental ancestor, </p><p>whose gift to posterity was absolutely useless, my </p><p>pocket-radio buzzed and the voice of my friend, </p><p>Stentor, the interplanetary broadcaster, issued from </p><p>the tiny instrument. </p><p> “If you're going to be home this afternoon,” said</p><p>Stentor. “I'll skate over. I have some interesting </p><p>news.” </p><p> I consented, for I thought I would share my</p><p>“find" with this friend whom I loved above all </p><p>others, but before he arrived I had again hidden </p><p>my golden chest, for I had decided to await the </p><p>development of events before sharing its mysteri- </p><p>ous secret with another. Tt was well that I did this </p><p>for Stentor was so filled with the importance of </p><p>his own news that he could have given me little </p><p>attention at first. </p><p> “Well, what is your interesting news?” I asked</p><p>after he was comfortably seated in my adjustable </p><p>chair. </p><p> “You'd never guess,” he replied with irritating</p><p>leisureliness. </p><p> “Does it pertain to Mars or Venus?” I queried.</p><p>“What news of our neighbor planets?” </p><p> “You may know it has nothing to do with the</p><p>self-satisfied Martians,” answered the broadcaster, </p><p>“but the Vcnusians have a very serious problem </p><p>confronting them. It is in connection with the same </p><p>old difficulty they have had ever since interplanetary </p><p>radio was developed forty years ago. You remem- </p><p>ber. that, in their second communication with us, </p><p>they told us of their continual warfare 011 insect </p><p>pests that were destroying all vegetable food? Well, </p><p>last night after general broadcasting had ceased, I </p><p>was surprised to hear the voice of the Venusian </p><p>broadcaster. He is suggesting that we get up a </p><p>scientific expedition to Venus to help the natives of </p><p>his unfortunate planet solve their insect problem as </p><p>we did ours. He says the Martians turn a deaf </p><p>ear to their plea for help, but he exacts sympathy </p><p>and assistance from Earth who has so recently </p><p>solved these problems for herself.” </p><p>THE MIRACLE OF THE LILY </p><p>53 </p><p> I was dumbfounded at Stentor’s news.</p><p> “But the Venusians are farther advanced me-</p><p>chanically than we,” I objected, “though they are </p><p>behind us in the natural sciences. They could much </p><p>more easily solve the* difficulties of space-flving </p><p>than we could.” </p><p> “That is true,” agreed Stentor, “but if we are to</p><p>render them material aid in freeing their world from </p><p>devastating insects, we must get to Venus. The </p><p>past four decades have proved that we can not help </p><p>them merely by verbal instructions.” </p><p> “Now, last night,” Stentor continued, with warm-</p><p>ing enthusiasm, “Wanyana, the Venusian broad- </p><p>caster, informed me that scientists on Venus are </p><p>developing interplanetary television. This, if suc- </p><p>cessful, will prove highly beneficial in facilitating </p><p>communication, and it may even do away with the </p><p>necessity of interplanetary travel, which I think is </p><p>centuries ahead of us yet.” </p><p> “Television, though so common here on Earth</p><p>and on Venus, has seemed an impossibility across </p><p>the ethereal void,” I said, “but if it becomes a reality, </p><p>I believe it will be the Venusians who will take the </p><p>initiative, though of course they will be helpless </p><p>without our friendly cooperation. In return for the </p><p>mechanical instructions they have given us from time </p><p>to time, I think it no more than right that we should </p><p>try to give them all the help possible in freeing their </p><p>world, as ours has been freed, of the insects that </p><p>threaten their very existence. Personally, therefore, </p><p>I hope it can be done through radio and television </p><p>rather than by personal excursions.” </p><p> “I believe you are right,” he admitted, “but I hope</p><p>we can be of service to them soon. Ever since I </p><p>have served in the capacity of official interplanetary </p><p>broadcaster. I have liked the spirit of good fellowship </p><p>shown by the Venusians through their spokesman, </p><p>Wanyana. The impression is favorable in contrast </p><p>to the superciliousness of the inhabitants of Mars.” </p><p>We conversed for some time, but at length he </p><p>rose to take his leave. It was then I ventured to </p><p>broach the subject that was uppermost in my </p><p>thoughts. </p><p> “I want to show you something, Stentor,” I said,</p><p>going into an adjoining room for my precious box </p><p>and returning shortly with it. “A relic from the </p><p>days of an ancestor named Del fair, who lived at </p><p>the time the last insect, a beetle, was kept in cap- </p><p>tivity. Judging from his personal account, Delfair</p><p>was fully aware of the significance of the changing </p><p>times in which he lived, and contrary to the majority </p><p>of his contemporaries, possessed a sentimentality of </p><p>soul that has proved an historical asset to future </p><p>generations. Look, my friend, these he left to </p><p>posterity!” </p><p> I deposited the heavy casket on a table between</p><p>us and lifted the lid, revealing to Stentor the mysti- </p><p>fying particles. </p><p> The face of Stentor was eloquent of astonish-</p><p>ment. Not unnaturally his mind took somewhat the </p><p>same route as mine had followed previously, though </p><p>lie added atomic-power-units to the list of possibili- </p><p>ties. He shook his head in perplexity. </p><p> “Whatever they are, there must have been a real</p><p>purpose behind their preservation.” he said at last. </p><p>“You say this old Delfair witnessed the passing of </p><p>the insects? What sort of a fellow was he? Likely </p><p>to be up to any tricks?” </p><p> “Not at all,” I asserted rather indignantly, “he</p><p>seemed a very serious minded chap; worked in an </p><p>oxygen-plant and took an active part in the last </p><p>warfare between men and insects.” </p><p> Suddenly Stentor stooped over and scooped up</p><p>some of the minute particles into the palm of his </p><p>hand—and then he uttered a maniacal shriek and </p><p>flung them into the air. </p><p> “Great God, man, do you know what they are?”</p><p>he screamed, shaking violently. </p><p> “No, I do not,” I replied quietly, with an attempt</p><p>at dignity I did not feel. </p><p> “Insect eggs!” he cried, and shuddering with ter-</p><p>ror, he made for the door. </p><p> I caught him on the threshold and pulled him</p><p>forcibly back into the room. </p><p> “Now see here,” I said sternly, “not a word of</p><p>this to anyone. Do you understand? I will test </p><p>out your theory in every possible way but I want </p><p>no public interference.” </p><p> At first he was obstinate, but finally yielded to</p><p>threats when supplications were impotent. </p><p> “I will test them,” I said, “and will endeavor to</p><p>keep hatchings under absolute control, should they </p><p>prove to be what you suspect.” </p><p> It was time for the evening broadcasting, so he</p><p>left, promising to keep our secret and leaving me </p><p>regretting that I had taken another into my </p><p>confidence. </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p> The Miracle</p><p>FOR days following my unfortunate experience </p><p>with Stentor. I experimented upon the tiny </p><p>objects that had so terrified him. I subjected </p><p>them to various tests for the purpose of ascertaining </p><p>whether or not they bore evidence of life, whether </p><p>in egg, pupa or larva stages of development. And </p><p>to all my experiments, there was but one answer. </p><p>No life was manifest. Yet I was not satisfied, for </p><p>chemical tests showed that they were composed of </p><p>organic matter. Here was an inexplicable enigma! </p><p>Many times I was on the verge of consigning the </p><p>entire contents of the chest to the flames. I seemed </p><p>to see in my mind’s eye the world again over-ridden </p><p>with insects, and that calamity due to the indis- </p><p>cretions of one man! My next impulse was to turn </p><p>over my problem to scientists, when a suspicion of </p><p>the truth dawned upon me. These were seeds, the </p><p>germs of plant-life, and they might grow. But alas, </p><p>where? Over all the earth man has spread his arti- </p><p>ficial dominion. The state-city has been succeeded </p><p>by what could be termed the nation-city, for one </p><p>great floor of concrete or rock covers the country. </p><p> I resolved to try an experiment, the far-reaching</p><p>influence of which I did not at that time suspect. </p><p>Beneath the lowest level of the community edifice </p><p>in which I dwell, I removed, by means of a small </p><p>atomic excavator, a slab of concrete large enough </p><p>to admit my body. I let myself down into the hole </p><p>and felt my feet resting on a soft dark substance ' </p><p>that T knew to be dirt. I hastily filled a box of </p><p>this, and after replacing the concrete slab, returned </p><p>to my room, where I proceeded to plant a variety </p><p>of the seeds. </p><p> Being a product of an age when practically to</p><p>wish for a thing in a material sense is to have it, I </p><p>experienced the greatest impatience, while waiting </p><p>for any evidences of plant-life to become manifest. </p><p>54 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>Daily, yes hourly, I watched the soil for signs of a </p><p>type of life long since departed from the earth, and </p><p>was about convinced that the germ of life could not </p><p>have survived the centuries, when a tiny blade of </p><p>green proved to me that a miracle, more wonderful </p><p>to me than the works of man through the ages, was </p><p>taking place before my eyes. This was an enigma </p><p>so complex and yet so simple, that one recognized in </p><p>it a direct revelation of Nature. </p><p> Daily and weekly I watched in secret the botanical</p><p>miracle. It was my one obsession. I was amazed </p><p>at the fascination it held for me—a man who viewed </p><p>the marvels of the thirty-fourth century with unemo- </p><p>tional complacency. It showed me that Nature is </p><p>manifest in the simple things which mankind has </p><p>chosen to ignore. </p><p> Then one morning, when T awoke, a white blossom</p><p>displayed its immaculate beauty and sent forth its </p><p>delicate fragrance into the air. The lily, a symbol of </p><p>new life, resurrection! I felt within me the stirring </p><p>of strange emotions I had long believed dead in the </p><p>bosom of man. But the message must not be for </p><p>me alone. As of old, the lily would be the symbol </p><p>of life for all! </p><p> With trembling hands, I carried my precious bur-</p><p>den to a front window where it might be witnessed </p><p>by all who passed by. The first day there were few </p><p>who saw it, for only rarely do men and women walk; </p><p>they usually ride in speeding vehicles of one kind </p><p>or another, or employ electric skates, a delightful </p><p>means of locomotion, which gives the body some </p><p>exercise. The fourth city level, which is reserved </p><p>for skaters and pedestrians, is kept in a smooth </p><p>glass-like condition. And so it was only the occa- </p><p>sional pedestrian, walking on the outer border of </p><p>the fourth level, upon which my window faced, who </p><p>first carried the news of the growing plant to the </p><p>world, and it was not long before it was necessary </p><p>for civic authorities to disperse the crowds that </p><p>thronged to my window for a glimpse of a miracle </p><p>in green and white. </p><p> When I showed my beautiful plant to Stentor, he</p><p>was most profuse in his apology and came to my </p><p>rooms every day to watch it unfold and develop, but </p><p>the majority of people, long used to business-like </p><p>efficiency, were intolerant of the sentimental emo- </p><p>tions that swayed a small minority, and I was com- </p><p>manded to dispose of the lily. But a figurative seed </p><p>had been planted in the human heart, a seed that </p><p>could not be disposed of so readily, and this seed </p><p>ripened and grew until it finally bore fruit.</p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>Ex Terreno </p><p>IT is a very different picture of humanity that </p><p>I paint ten years after the last entry in my </p><p>diary. My new vocation is farming, but it is </p><p>farming on a far more intensive scale than had </p><p>been done two thousand years ago. Our crops </p><p>never fail, for temperature and rainfall are regu- </p><p>lated artificially. But we attribute our success prin- </p><p>cipally to the total absence of insect pests. Our </p><p>small agricultural areas dot the country like the parks </p><p>of ancient days and supply us with a type of food, </p><p>no more nourishing, but more appetizing than that </p><p>produced in the laboratories. Truly we are living </p><p>in a marvelous age! If the earth is ours completely, </p><p>why may we not turn our thoughts toward the other </p><p>planets in our solar-system? For the past ten or </p><p>eleven years the Venusians have repeatedly urged </p><p>us to come and assist them in their battle for life. </p><p>I believe it is our duty to help them. </p><p> Tomorrow will be a great day for us and especially</p><p>for Stentor, as the new interplanetary television is </p><p>to be tested, and it is possible that for the first time </p><p>in history, we shall see our neighbors in the infinity </p><p>of space. Although the people of Venus were about </p><p>a thousand years behind us in many respects, they </p><p>have made wonderful progress with radio and tele- </p><p>vision. We have been in radio communication with </p><p>them for the last half century and they shared with </p><p>us the joy of the establishment of our Eden. They </p><p>have always been greatly interested in hearing </p><p>Stentor tell the story of our subjugation of the in- </p><p>sects that threatened to wipe us out of existence, </p><p>for they have exactly that problem to solve now; </p><p>judging from their reports, we fear that theirs is </p><p>a losing battle. To,-morrow we shall converse face </p><p>to face with the Venusians! It will be an event </p><p>second in importance only to the first radio com- </p><p>munications interchanged fifty years ago. Stentor's </p><p>excitement exceeds that displayed at the time of </p><p>the discovery of the seeds. </p><p> Well it is over and the experiment was a success,</p><p>but alas for the revelation! </p><p> The great assembly halls all over the continent</p><p>were packed with humanity eager to catch a first </p><p>glimpse of the Venusians. Prior to the test, we </p><p>sent our message of friendship and good will by </p><p>radio, and received a reciprocal one from our inter- </p><p>planetary neighbors. Alas, we were ignorant at </p><p>that time! Then the television receiving apparatus </p><p>was put into operation, and we sat with breathless-</p><p>interest, our eyes intent upon the crystal screen </p><p>before us. I sat near Stentor and noted the feverish </p><p>ardor with which he watched for the first glimpse </p><p>of Wanyana. </p><p> At first hazy mist-like spectres seemed to glide</p><p>across the screen. We knew these figures were not </p><p>in correct perspective. Finally, one object gradu- </p><p>ally became more opaque, its outlines could be seen </p><p>clearly. Then across that vast assemblage, as well </p><p>as thousands of others throughout the world, there </p><p>swept a wave of speechless horror, as its full signifi- </p><p>cance burst upon mankind. </p><p> The figure that stood facing us was a huge six-</p><p>legged beetle, not identical in every detail with our </p><p>earthly enemies of past years, but unmistakably an </p><p>insect of gigantic proportions! Of course it could </p><p>not see us, for our broadcaster was not to appear </p><p>until afterward, but it spoke, and we had to close </p><p>our eyes to convince ourselves that it was the familiar </p><p>voice of Wanyana, the leading Venusian radio </p><p>broadcaster. Stentor grabbed my arm, uttered an </p><p>inarticulate cry and would have fallen but for my </p><p>timely support. </p><p> “Friends of Earth, as you call your world,” began</p><p>the object of horror, “this is a momentous occasion^ </p><p>in the annals of the twin planets, and we are looking* </p><p>forward to seeing one of you, and preferably Sten- </p><p>tor. for the first time, as you arc now viewing one </p><p>of us. We have listened many times, with interest, </p><p>to your story of the insect pests which threatened to </p><p>follow you as lords of your planet. As you have </p><p>often heard us tell, we are likewise molested with </p><p>insects. Our fight is a losing one, unless we can </p><p>soon exterminate them.” </p><p>THE MIRACLE OF THE LILY </p><p>55 </p><p> Suddenly, the Venusian was joined by another</p><p>being, a colossal ant, who bore in his fore-legs a </p><p>tiny light-colored object which he handed to the </p><p>beetle-announcer, who took it and held it forward </p><p>for our closer inspection. It seemed to be a tiny </p><p>ape, but was so small we could not ascertain for a </p><p>certainty. We were convinced, however, that it </p><p>was a mammalian creature, an “insect" pest of </p><p>Venus. Yet in it we recognized rudimentary man </p><p>as we know him on earth! </p><p> There was no question as to the direction in which</p><p>sympathies instinctively turned, yet reason told us </p><p>that our pity should be given to the intelligent reign- </p><p>ing race who had risen to its present mental attain- </p><p>ment through eons of time. By some quirk or freak </p><p>of nature, way back in the beginning, life had de- </p><p>veloped in the form of insects instead of mammals. </p><p>Or (the thought was repellent) had insects in the </p><p>past succeeded in displacing mammals, as they might* </p><p>have done here on earth? </p><p> There was no more television that night. Stentor</p><p>would not appear, so disturbed was he by the sight </p><p>of the Venusians, bat in the morning, he talked to </p><p>them by radio and explained the very natural an- </p><p>tipathy we experienced in seeing them or in having </p><p>them see us. </p><p> Now they no longer urge us to construct ether-</p><p>ships and go to help them dispose of their “insects." </p><p>I think they are afraid of us. and their very fear </p><p>has aroused in mankind an unholy desire to con- </p><p>quer them. </p><p> I am against it. Have we not had enough of war</p><p>in the past? We have subdued our own world and </p><p>should be content with that, instead of seeking new </p><p>worlds to conquer. But life is too easy here. I </p><p>can plainly see that.

The magazine has </p><p>been changed from its former page of </p><p>8x11 inches to I he new one of 8%xll% </p><p>inches, which now makes it a standard </p><p>size. This means that we can give a little </p><p>more tejxt per page and that our illustra- </p><p>tions can be larger and that the size will </p><p>be much handier. We have also improved </p><p>on the binding, as many complaints were </p><p>received from readers that the magazine </p><p>fell apart after its back was broken. It is </p><p>now side-wire stitched, as are most maga- </p><p>zines, and it is hoped that our readers </p><p>will like the improvements. </p><p> It will be noted that the magazine is a</p><p>great deal easier to handle than it was </p><p>before, and beginning with the next is- </p><p>sue. we shall use a much better and </p><p>easier reading type all the way through, </p><p>and make certain other typographical im- </p><p>provements. which we know you will like. </p><p> We shall be very glad to hear from you</p><p>if you approve of the changes and we </p><p>shall be glad to receive any other sugges-</p><p>tions that will tend to better AMAZING </p><p>STORIES still further. </p><p>THE PUBLISHERS. </p><p>^ANCIENT HORROR </p><p>by fflal Grant" </p><p>His hand had barely grasped the oar again when, silently, from the blue depths, there came into view, Just behind Wilson, the awful </p><p>head and neck of the creature we had dimly seen that night, when we sat crouched on a shaky platform ... Up it rose, to a height of </p><p>•even or eight feet, while I, gazing upon its utter frightfulness, stood paralyzed and dumb. I saw its cavernous mouth, fully three feet </p><p>from the snout to the angle of the jaw; 6aw it open and reveal its gleaming, needle-sharp teeth over the head of the unfortunate man: </p><p>THE ANCIENT HORROR </p><p>57 </p><p>will be interesting if they happen to </p><p>nd the lizard and it turns out to be the </p><p>;al thing.” </p><p>“What thing?” I asked. Rutherford </p><p>ad been reading the paper to himself. </p><p>By way of reply, he handed me the paper, at the </p><p>same time pointing to a head-line carrying the in- </p><p>formation that scientists were on their way to Africa </p><p>to search for a “Pre-Historic Monster Seem by </p><p>Hunters in Northern African Swamp.” </p><p> From the writer’s description, I gathered the</p><p>idea that the creature was supposed to belong to one </p><p>of the species of gigantic saurians that roamed the </p><p>earth during the reptilian age, some five hundred </p><p>millions of years ago. </p><p> I thought the story a hoax and said so. Ruther-</p><p>ford didn’t agree with me, calling my attention to </p><p>the fact that the men—whose names were given— </p><p>were all well known, which made it unlikely that </p><p>any writer would use them in connection with any- </p><p>thing that savoured of deceit. </p><p> “I believe they have evidence warranting such an</p><p>expedition, or they would not go. Moreover, I shall </p><p>not be surprised to read, at some future date, that </p><p>they have discovered the thing, whatever it is, and </p><p>that it furnishes them with some very interesting </p><p>experiences.” </p><p> Well, every one has a right to his opinion, even</p><p>though he has no foundation upon which to base it, </p><p>so I didn't argue with him, beyond saying that I </p><p>presumed he had some very good reason for being </p><p>so positive. </p><p> Perhaps he thought I was a trifle sarcastic. At</p><p>any rate he looked at me through contracted eyes </p><p>for a moment, as if trying to make up his mind about </p><p>something; then, having filled his pipe, he reached </p><p>for a match and, after lighting the tobacco, he said </p><p>quietly, ‘‘Yes, I do believe there are living descend- </p><p>ants of those saurians and that they are, in appear- </p><p>ance, like the old fellows we read about. Also, I </p><p>believe I have good reason for thinking there are </p><p>some that resemble no known species, and, since you </p><p>won’t take any stock in my belief until you have </p><p>some proof, I am going to give you some, provided, </p><p>of course, that you will accept my unsupported </p><p>word that what I tell you </p><p>is true.” </p><p> Rutherford is not one</p><p>given to making statements </p><p>that are not true. If he </p><p>says he knows a thing to be </p><p>so, from personal knowl- </p><p>edge, that settles it. lie </p><p>always was that way, even </p><p>in school. More than </p><p>once I have known him to take a licking when, by </p><p>simply mis-stating the facts, he would have saved </p><p>himself. Knowng him as I did, I told him to go </p><p>ahead and give me the proof, if he wanted to, but, </p><p>that I’d take his word for the “reason” wthout any </p><p>further evidence. I hadn’t the slightest idea as to </p><p>what his “proofs” were, or I should not have taken </p><p>the chance of missing them. Aside from a tale of </p><p>fiction, I’ve never heard, or read of anything that </p><p>approached his story for horror. And the setting </p><p>was perfect. Rutherford and I, alone in the hunt- </p><p>ing lodge on the shore of a northern lake at night, </p><p>with the November wind howling through the trees </p><p>that surrounded the house on three sides, and driving </p><p>torrents of rain and sleet against the windows and </p><p>upon the shakes that covered the roof. An eerie </p><p>night, for an eerie tale. </p><p> “I’ve never told this story before,” he began, “be-</p><p>cause there is little chance of being thought any- </p><p>thing but a liar. I’ve often wanted to tell it though, </p><p>and this moment seems very opportune. Every word </p><p>is gospel truth.” </p><p> “In this case, as in all others, cause and effect are</p><p>operative,” he began. “If I hadn’t caught the flu </p><p>in the winter of nineteen hundred and five, I should </p><p>never have known anything about it. </p><p> “1 had a pretty bad case of it and, only by the</p><p>skin of my teeth, did I manage to pull through. </p><p>Even at that, I barely missed ‘going west/ for I was </p><p>left with a lung complication that my doctor thought </p><p>was a touch of T.B. </p><p> “As soon as the weather permitted, he ordered me</p><p>into the mountains for an indefinite time. ‘Any place,’ </p><p>he said, ‘where there are lots of pine trees and clean </p><p>air.’ It seems odd that, out of all the familiar places </p><p>on earth, which I might have chosen, I should have </p><p>selected a place I had never heard of before, just </p><p>because the name, when I read it on the route marked </p><p>out in a railway time table, reminded me of a little </p><p>girl I used to like back in my school days. </p><p> “Maybe you will remember her, Elsie Hampton.</p><p>She went to school with us, back thefe. in Stowe, </p><p>Vermont.

Here they found cause in </p><p>plenty. The huge, artificial lake was dry and the </p><p>creek that fed it was pouring into a great hole in </p><p>the center of the basin, near the dam and. from the </p><p>roar that issued forth, one could guess that the water </p><p>was falling some distance. </p><p> “Ordinarily, a hole may be stopped up. This was</p><p>more than a hole; a continuous stream of water of </p><p>considerable size failed to fill it. Evidently there </p><p>was a cavern, or a number of caverns, underneath </p><p>the surface with outlets, possibly sufficiently large </p><p>to carry away any overflow. </p><p> “There were two newspapers in Hampton. One</p><p>backed up the ‘Boosters,’ while the other stood with </p><p>the ‘Conservatives,’ and the reservoir incident fur- </p><p>nished the rival papers with a plentiful supply of </p><p>material for publication. </p><p> “As might be guessed, the conservative organ was</p><p>mean and caustic. Of course, nobody could have </p><p>foreseen such a catastrophe—for it amounted to that. </p><p> “The other paper tried to explain, and really did</p><p>explain. The cause was entirely obvious. The </p><p>creek, for at least that part of it that had passed over </p><p>the spot where the hole now was, had flowed over </p><p>the thin rock cover of an underground chamber, or </p><p>chambers, of huge dimensions. In view of what </p><p>occurred a year later. 1 believe there must have been </p><p>at least two, or more. This thin plate, or cover, had </p><p>been strong enough to support the weight of the </p><p>stream, but it was constantly growing thinner and </p><p>it was apparently not strong enough to bear the </p><p>greater strain imposed upon it by the water in the </p><p>reservoir. </p><p> “The conservative paper admitted this but tried</p><p>to convince its readers that the engineers should have </p><p>known, from the formation of the rocks, that such </p><p>an accident was liable to occur. </p><p> “And so they went at it, hammer and tongs, until,</p><p>like a bolt from the clear blue sky, came another </p><p>phenomenal occurrence. This, I suppose, might have </p><p>been anticipated, although I don’t see how\ </p><p>(( A MAN by the name of Wilson owned a large </p><p> JT\ farm that abutted upon the creek. In fact,</p><p>a part of the lake formed by the reservoir encroached </p><p>upon Wilson’s property, and would have covered a </p><p>large part of it. were it not for a retaining wall that </p><p>had been built to keep the water back. This wall </p><p>ran from a point near the upstream end of the reser- </p><p>voir to within a hundred feet of the dam. The </p><p>remaining space was filled by a sort of mound, </p><p>rising some fifteen feet, or more, above the surface </p><p>of the water at high level. This mound was very </p><p>much like a turtle’s shell in shape, a hundred </p><p>feet in length, about fifty feet wide at its base. I </p><p>mention the mound at this point in the story, because </p><p>it played an important part in a later incident, and </p><p>I want you to remember the details. </p><p> “One morning, while the principal topic of con-</p><p>versation was still the reservoir cave-in, Wilson came </p><p>into town, all bet up! Winding up in the Mayor’s </p><p>office, he sprung a sensation upon that official by </p><p>declaring that his farm had ‘sunk out of sight.’ This </p><p>was, to be sure, a mean and unusual trick for a farm </p><p>to play upon its owner and the Mayor was both as- </p><p>tonished and sympathetic. Wilson didn’t want sym- </p><p>pathy; he wanted damages, which put an entirely </p><p>different light on the story. At first, the Mayor </p><p>thought Wilson was crazy, but he soon changed his </p><p>mind and. calling in the County Attorney, asked </p><p>Wilson to tell the story in detail. </p><p> “Wilson said lie had been aroused from sleep by</p><p>a strange noise, a sort of tearing sound mixed with </p><p>a great roar and, upon getting up and going to his </p><p>window, which faced the reservoir, he had seen a </p><p>great gush of water, spurting up through the hole in </p><p>its bed, and that a few moments later there had </p><p>been another tearing, crashing noise and all his best </p><p>garden land had broken away from higher and less </p><p>valuable land, and ‘dropped plum out of sight.’ </p><p> “He was still standing, open mouthed, at the win-</p><p>dow when there came another explosion, followed by </p><p>a tearing noise and a great chasm appeared in the </p><p>northern end of the depression into which his farm </p><p>had sunk and through this came a rushing volume of </p><p>water. By this time, Wilson said, he thought he’d </p><p>‘better put 011 some clothes and investigate.’ </p><p> “Continuing, he said that, when lie reached the side</p><p>of the cave-in, he saw that it was rapidly being filled </p><p>with water that came pouring into it through the rent </p><p>in the upper end. He had watched until morning </p><p>when, the water, having reached a point a few inches </p><p>below the firm edge of his remaining land, had </p><p>ceased to rise, and lie concluded it had gone as high </p><p>as it ever would. </p><p> “At first he was mystified, but at last decided that</p><p>his misfortune was due to the cave-in of the reser- </p><p>voir, the water having washed the underpinning from </p><p>beneath his property. Well, both the Mayor and the </p><p>County Attorney agreed with him—forgetting in </p><p>the excitement induced by the fantastic story, that </p><p>Wilson was there to secure damages. </p><p> “Of course the Mayor couldn’t do anything for</p><p>Wilson, and the County Attorney, seeing no better </p><p>way out of the tangle, advised the man to get a </p><p>lawyer and bring suit. </p><p> “The case didn’t come to trial—not then—for</p><p>the city figured a w'ay out of the trouble into which </p><p>the cave-in had drawn it. </p><p> “Analysis showed that the water in the newly</p><p>formed lake was the same water the city had been </p><p>getting from the reservoir and so an appraiser fixed </p><p>a valuation upon the sunken property that satisfied </p><p>Wilson, and, this settled, preparations were begun </p><p>to connect up the lake with the pipe line. </p><p> “But, the chain of unusual happenings was not</p><p>yet at an end. The day before Wilson was to receive </p><p>the money for his land, water began to flow through </p><p>the hundreds of taps that had been left open since </p><p>they ran dry. A11 investigation revealed the fact </p><p>that the reservoir had begun to fill up again and, </p><p>as soon as the news reached the County Attorney’s </p><p>office, payment to Wilson was held up. pending such </p><p>a time as might be needed to show whether or not </p><p>the reservoir would fill and remain full. </p><p> “When it became apparent that there was to be no</p><p>more trouble with the water supply, the City called </p><p>the deal off. Wilson then took his case into court </p><p>and lost. He carried it up on an appeal, and lost </p><p>again, the higher court sustaining the lower and jus- </p><p>tifying itself in so doing by stating that what had </p><p>occurred was ‘an act of God,’ for which the city </p><p>was not liable. </p><p> “During the trial, I l&gt;ecame acquainted with Wil-</p><p>son and. afterwards he invited me out to his place. </p><p>I was glad to go with him for his invitation carried </p><p>THE ANCIENT HORROR </p><p>59 </p><p>with it the assurance of better conditions of living- </p><p>for me, for I had been unable to secure suitable quar- </p><p>ters in any of the farm homes outside of Hampton. </p><p>1 conjectured that, if Wilson’s place suited my fancy, </p><p>I could very likely make arrangements with him </p><p>which would enable me to remain at his place in- </p><p>definitely. I did succeed in doing so and, who knows </p><p>but that I might have met with the same unpleasant </p><p>experience he did, had not Fate willed it otherwise. </p><p> “Adventure, like romance, lies just around the</p><p>corner. One does not need to go to Africa, as these </p><p>scientists are doing, in order to find adventure any </p><p>more than it is necessary to go to Europe for ro- </p><p>mance, and the adventure ahead of me that summer </p><p>day, as I sat in Wilson’s rattling Flivver, en route to </p><p>his place, was very real. No other man ever lived </p><p>through an experience more bizarre, more horrible </p><p>than the one that was waiting for me, at Wilson’s </p><p>place. </p><p> “It didn’t take us long to cover the distance be-</p><p>tween Hampton and the farm which, even with most </p><p>of the tillable land under water, was a beautiful </p><p>place. That part of the property covered with the </p><p>water from the reservoir had been practically the </p><p>only really flat land in the whole estate; the rest was </p><p>rolling and hilly, and for the most part, covered with </p><p>timber. The lake lay almost in the center of the </p><p>‘farm,’ as Wilson called it and, while it completely </p><p>ruined the farm for agriculture, it added immensely </p><p>to its charm and beauty. Roughly oval and nearly </p><p>a mile in diameter, it twinkled in its bed like a great </p><p>sapphire encircled with emeralds. Owing to its depth, </p><p>which, according to Wilson’s estimate, was some- </p><p>thing about five hundred feet, the water would re- </p><p>main cold always, which made it an ideal place for </p><p>any trout which entered from the creek, to live and </p><p>breed in. </p><p> “I said as much to Wilson that evening after sup-</p><p>per. Evidently, he had never thought of such a </p><p>thing; his mind was centered upon his loss. He </p><p>mulled the thing over in his mind for a moment, and </p><p>as the possibilities of such a proposition grew upon </p><p>him. he said, ‘if that danged lake had fish in it, I </p><p>wouldn’t take any price you could name for it. I </p><p>could get more out of the water then than I ever </p><p>got out of the land and still own it.’ And I knew </p><p>he was right. Given fish, he had the world by the </p><p>tail. It would make a wonderful summer resort, </p><p>for cottages could be built along the lake which </p><p>would bring high rent for the season, lie surely </p><p>needed fish. </p><p>4 6 AND the fish came, but not until we had about </p><p> jt\ given up all hope that they would. I had</p><p>become Wilson’s star boarder, for he had invited me </p><p>to stay there as long as I liked, as his guest. I spent </p><p>the days helping Wilson keep house. He was a </p><p>widower for some years, and wandered about the </p><p>lake, looking for signs of fish. </p><p> “Then, one afternoon, just at sun-down, I saw</p><p>one feap out of the water. I shouted to Wilson, </p><p>who answered the call on the run and got there in </p><p>time to see another one jump up out of the blue </p><p>depths. He gripped my arm and said, ‘Rutherford, </p><p>I shall need some help, financially. If you want to </p><p>go in with me. we’ll split the profits. What do you </p><p>say?’ I thought the matter over for a moment, then </p><p>told him I'd furnish the needed capital. We stayed </p><p>there, at the side of the lake, until dark, talking </p><p>the matter over and watching the ‘dollars,’ as Wil- </p><p>son was pleased to call the trout, jump out of the </p><p>water. We then went back to the house to make </p><p>further plans for the next season. </p><p> “Two weeks later we had a dozen summer cottages</p><p>well on the road toward completion. We expected </p><p>to build more, later, but we figured a dozen, to start </p><p>with, would be sufficient, which shows how nearly a </p><p>couple of greenhorns can come to making a correct </p><p>guess. We could have rented a hundred, if we had </p><p>them. Later I wished I had never thought of build- </p><p>ing a single cottage. But who could have dreamed </p><p>of such consequence? </p><p> “The cottages, which were erected on a sufficiently</p><p>large, cleared space, on the southeast shore of the </p><p>lake, were completed before the cold weather set in, </p><p>and after closing the board shutters over the win- </p><p>dows to protect them from possible breakage, we </p><p>devoted our time to planning a campaign for the </p><p>Spring. </p><p> “Winter passed reluctantly it seemed to Wilson</p><p>and me, but it gave way to Spring at last and shortly </p><p>after I went to the city. There I had a series of talks </p><p>with certain dealers in fish, which resulted, as soon </p><p>as the fishing season opened, in a big window display </p><p>of strings of trout that made the disciples of Isaac </p><p>Walton almost wild to swing a fly over their habitat. </p><p>A carefully worded legend that accompanied the dis- </p><p>play gave the necessary information. The season </p><p>opened with all our cottages occupied and we were </p><p>making money. </p><p>64T r[£RY shortly after, we began to hear strange </p><p>V noises, in the night. If we had been very </p><p>near a seaport town I should have thought the sound,</p><p>though rather sharp, was given by a ship’s siren. </p><p>However, since we were better than eighteen hundred </p><p>miles from the ocean, and a thousand miles from </p><p>any other body of water large enough to float a ship, </p><p>we concluded that it was a particularly awful whistle </p><p>on the railroad, that ran some three miles to the west </p><p>of us. It bothered us for about a week, then, like </p><p>all other noises that occur at frequent intervals, it </p><p>ceased to bother us much. There was some specula- </p><p>tion among the cottagers but, when we told them it </p><p>probably came from some engine, they accepted the </p><p>statement for fact, and forgot all about it. Be- </p><p>sides, what does a little noise amount to when the </p><p>fishing is good? And it was. </p><p> “There was only one fault to be found with our</p><p>lake, or its environment. Owing to the altitude and </p><p>the added fact that it lay so deep down among the </p><p>hills, the nights were too chilly to permit of comfort </p><p>on the lake after dark. However, there was plenty </p><p>of warmth during the daytime, so it didn’t matter </p><p>so very much. </p><p> “Along about the first part of July, however, we</p><p>had a stretch of very hot weather. The warmth con- </p><p>tinued well into the night, and the early evening </p><p>hours found the lake pretty well dotted with boats </p><p>and canoes, passing back and forth near the shore </p><p>and pretty well out into the lake. </p><p> “The first break in the calm order of our lives</p><p>came one evening, during this hot spell. Wilson </p><p>and I were down at the lake, cleaning some trout we </p><p>had caught. It was about eight, or a little later and </p><p>it was getting dark rapidly. We had practically no </p><p>twilight. We had just finished our job when a long, </p><p>agonizing scream, as one in mortal anguish, came </p><p>vibrating over the lake, from some point down in </p><p>the southwestern corner. Dropping our fish, Wilson </p><p>60 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>and I ran oovvn the shore, in the direction 01 the </p><p>cottages, only to find all the women, and a couple </p><p>of men huddled in a frightened group, down by the </p><p>shore. In reply to our queries, one of the men said </p><p>chat the scream came from young Barnaby who, with </p><p>his father and mother, occupied one of the cottages. </p><p> “As it chanced, no one had been out on the lake,</p><p>except the young man. All the other men, with the </p><p>exception of the two who were on the shore when </p><p>we got there, were in Hampton, laying in more sup- </p><p>plies. When his mother called to young Barnaby to </p><p>come in. lie answered he would be ‘back in a few </p><p>moments,’ but for some unearthly reason, had started </p><p>toward the deepening darkness of the western shore. </p><p>The boy's mother had remained on the cottage porch, </p><p>following the lad with a mother’s anxious eyes, as he </p><p>paddled away into the shadows. The two men, also </p><p>watching from the shore, commented upon the boy's </p><p>‘whim.’ </p><p> “Up to this point there was perfect agreement;</p><p>then started differences of opinion, as to what fol- </p><p>lowed. One man said he was certain the boy had </p><p>started to change ends, in the canoe, and had cap- </p><p>sized it in so doing. His neighbor was equally cer- </p><p>tain that he had dimly seen the young man stand up </p><p>in the canoe and, with the paddle, strike at some- </p><p>thing and then suddenly pitch forward, out of the </p><p>canoe, screaming as he fell. </p><p> ALL this was told by the two men, while the</p><p> jLiL four of us, in two boats, were racing toward</p><p>the spot where the boy was last seen. </p><p> “Although the man who declared the accident had</p><p>been due to the boy’s attempt to ‘change ends’ still </p><p>stuck to his opinion, I felt, somehow, that he was </p><p>wrong. Barnaby was, I had been told, a crack swim- </p><p>mer and. considering that he must have been close </p><p>to shore when he fell into the water, I was con- </p><p>vinced that merely being capsized would hardly have </p><p>elicited such a cry of agony. No! I felt, abso- </p><p>lutely, that there had been some sort of an attack </p><p>made upon him and that he had tried to fight off the </p><p>attacker, whoever, or whatever it was, with his pad- </p><p>dle, and that he had failed in the attempt. And, as </p><p>I tried to guess what sort of danger the unfortunate </p><p>boy had faced, chills of horror went down my spine. </p><p> “So thoroughly convinced was I that something</p><p>terrible had happened to Barnaby, and that he was </p><p>beyond help, that the sight of his overturned canoe, </p><p>as we drew near it, acted only as a sickening con-</p><p>firmation. Yet, knowing that it was useless, I urged </p><p>a careful search and, with the others, called his name, </p><p>again and again. They may have hoped; I did not. </p><p>I merely knew the boy was dead. </p><p> “I kept my thoughts to myself, however, since</p><p>voicing my suspicions would* only make matters </p><p>worse. It would be bad enough to believe her only </p><p>son had been drowned, but. I doubted whether her </p><p>reason would bear the shock of the awful thing I </p><p>had in mind. Wilson followed my example. </p><p> “Having no grappling irons, we would not drag</p><p>the lake that night, but I told Mrs. Barnaby. who </p><p>bore up remarkably well, that I would get some from </p><p>Hampton in the morning. Hampton had none, so </p><p>we had to devise them from clumsily made heavy </p><p>rods and hooks. </p><p> “Young Barnaby’s father wanted to go with us,</p><p>but 1 prevailed upon him to remain with his wife. </p><p>I felt it was l&gt;est, because, while I did not expect to </p><p>recover the body, I realized the possibility of some- </p><p>thing very sinister, and I felt it would be better for </p><p>him not to see what the irons might bring to the sur- </p><p>face. Maybe he sensed something of my thought, </p><p>for he consented at last to remain behind. </p><p> “We loaded the clumsy drag with the rope at-</p><p> tached (I had bought eight hundred feet, in order</p><p> fo make sure we had enough) into the boat and. with</p><p> Wilson at the oars, pulled over to the place where the</p><p> accident occurred. We had some trouble getting the</p><p> drag into the water, owing to its awkward shape and</p><p> weight, but we finally succeeded in lowering it. It</p><p> seemed as if the drag would never reach bottom.</p><p> Five hundred feet is a long way down.</p><p> “When, finally, the drag came to rest. I sat down</p><p> in the stern of the boat and told Wilson to row</p><p> slowly. He did. He did even better than that; he</p><p> hardly moved at all. I thought the drag might have</p><p> caught on some snag, but YVilson assured me there</p><p> was no such thing in the whole area of the lake.</p><p> It required the combined efforts of eight men, two</p><p> to a boat, to pull that thing.</p><p> “We worked all day, dragging every foot of the</p><p> lake within a radius of several hundred yards from</p><p> the spot where the boy went down. We found noth-</p><p> ing that day nor the next day, nor any day within</p><p> the week of heartbreaking labor.</p><p> “It was labor lost, but it was necessary. There</p><p> was no use running the risk of. not only driving a</p><p> mother and. perhaps, a father crazy, but of ruining</p><p> our business. And, of course, I might have been</p><p> mistaken.</p><p> “The Barnaby cottage was vacant the day after we</p><p> ceased to drag the lake, and it looked, for a while,</p><p> as though the others might be. too; but, after talking</p><p> the matter over, the occupants decided that it was</p><p> only an accident, sad. indeed, but only too common</p><p> and, since going back home would not help these</p><p> parents to recover their boy, they might just as well</p><p> try to forget it. So they stayed and the vacant cot-</p><p> tage was soon rented again.</p><p> “One thing, however, they didn’t forget—that the</p><p> ‘accident’ happened in the evening; so. although the</p><p> warm spell continued, they kept off the lake after</p><p> sundown.</p><p> “Nearly a month went by with no untoward hap-</p><p> pening. Even those night noises ceased and I began</p><p> to think I had let my imagination run wild, and that</p><p> young Barnaby’s death had been due to a simple</p><p> capsize of his canoe. Then, there was another ac-</p><p> cident and, this time, it was a particularly horrible</p><p> one. To add to its sinister aspects, it took, for its</p><p> victims, the young couple who occupied the cottage</p><p> in which the Barnaby family had lived.</p><p> “The young man and his wife.—their name was</p><p> Whipple,—had been married only a little over a</p><p> year. Mrs. Whipple, a rather frail woman of the</p><p> neurotic type, temperamental, crochety and stubborn</p><p> as the Devil, was soon to become a mother and her</p><p> condition, of course, didn’t make her any easier to</p><p> get along with. She was a beauty, though, and</p><p> Whipple adored her.</p><p> “But. unreasonable as she was, Mrs. Whipple rea- '</p><p> lized that she was in no condition to risk being tipped</p><p> into the water, even if she had been a good swimmer,</p><p> so she kept off the lake, contenting herself with sit-</p><p> ting in the bow of the boat, which was tied to a</p><p> stake driven into the ground, a few feet from the</p><p> edge. There was absolutely no shore, no beach, and</p><p> the water, at the edge of the lake, grew suddenly</p><p> deep.</p><p>THE ANCIENT HORROR </p><p>61 </p><p> “No one will ever know what prompted her to</p><p>insist upon going out on the lake that night. Prob- </p><p>ably it was just an unaccountable whim, common to </p><p>women. Had Whipple been a little more coaxingly </p><p>diplomatic, he might have talked her out of the no- </p><p>tion, but, unfortunately, he emphatically negatived </p><p>her suggestion that he take her ‘for a little boat ride’ </p><p>before they went to bed, and the fat was in the fire. </p><p>What had been, when made, just a simple, wheedling </p><p>request, became a demand, backed up by evidence of </p><p>approaching hysterics. </p><p> “According to Holy Writ, which is accepted by</p><p>many people as being true, Eve succeeded in getting </p><p>Adam to eat the apple, even when he knew the con- </p><p>sequences were going to be disastrous, so what could </p><p>be expected of a man, so deeply in love with his wife, </p><p>who only feared the possibility of an unpleasant re- </p><p>sult of his yielding? Whipple held out, for a little </p><p>time but, in the end, she devilled him into taking her </p><p>and, to make the matter worse, she insisted upon </p><p>going, ‘straight across to the opposite shore and </p><p>back.’ </p><p> “I was present at the time; that is I was within</p><p>hearing distance, having been, engaged in conversa- </p><p>tion with the man next door to Whipple. When I </p><p>heard him, grudgingly, consent to take his wife </p><p>across, I had a feeling of dread, a premonition of </p><p>something dreadful in connection with it. Using all </p><p>the tact I possessed, I tried to dissuade her from </p><p>going. But it was useless. She listened, politely </p><p>enough, for she was well brought up, but she was </p><p>unshaken and what more could I do ? True, I might </p><p>have taken hold of the painter and refused to allow </p><p>Whipple to take the boat, as T had a ‘hunch’ to do. </p><p>But that would have necessitated an explanation, </p><p>which I could hardly give. So I contented myself </p><p>with saying that I wouldn’t do it under the circum- </p><p>stances. Which helped not at all. </p><p> “I've known people to laugh at ‘a hunch.’ They</p><p>claim there is nothing to it, that the ‘feeling’ is due </p><p>to some trifling nervous disorder, entirely physi- </p><p>ological. Some attribute it to over-stimulation of </p><p>the nerves by alcohol, or tobacco. Well, perhaps it </p><p>is due to any one, or all of these causes, but I’ve </p><p>never known it to fail in my own case, and I’ve had </p><p>plenty of chance to test it out. The proof, of course, </p><p>is entirely one-sided, for, if I ‘feel’ that I’ll be sorry </p><p>later if I do a certain thing, and I obey that ‘hunch,’ </p><p>I never know that punishment would really have fol- </p><p>lowed had I disregarded the feeling. It is like taking </p><p>the Pasteur treatment for suspected rabies infection. </p><p>If the treatment is taken before rabies develops in the</p><p>person, it can never be known, for certain, that there </p><p>was any need for the treatment. All that is known </p><p>is, if there is an infection and the treatment is not </p><p>taken, the person dies, most horribly. So with a </p><p>‘hunch.’ It may be all bunk, as the cold-blooded, </p><p>matter-of-fact people claim, but it doesn’t cost much </p><p>to play the ‘hunch’ and, as a rule, I do. </p><p>f fT STOOD there, on the shore, watching the out- </p><p> JL line of the boat grow dimmer and dimmer as it</p><p>neared the middle of the lake. It was the second </p><p>night of the new moon. The starless sky was like </p><p>black velvet. And it seemed ominously still to me. </p><p>At the first terrible ullulation of a woman in deadly </p><p>peril, which came echoing across the black stretch of </p><p>water, I felt, not so much of surprise, as confirmation </p><p>of a previous certainty. None the less, my very soul </p><p>sickened with dread and horror and when, an instant </p><p>later, the hoarser cry of a man smote my ears, I </p><p>knew the tragedy was complete—both Whipple and </p><p>his wife were past help. </p><p> “I must have been very close to hysteria for, when</p><p> Wilson, whose teeth were chattering, grasped my</p><p> arm, I shook him off with an oath, and ran for the</p><p> boat, closely followed by the other men.</p><p> “As a rule,-I am not much bothered by ‘nerves.’</p><p> It is not due to any courage of an unusual sort, for</p><p> I have known fear many times, but I certainly had</p><p> them that night, when we pulled across the lake,</p><p> toward the spot from which had come those terrible</p><p> cries. Although I have crawled out into the mud and</p><p> filth of ‘No Man’s Land,’ in the blackness of a rainy</p><p> night, knowing that death would be my portion if I</p><p> should betray my presence by a sound, my nerves</p><p> were steady although fear was in my heart. I knew</p><p> in what manner I should die and the knowledge</p><p> helped. But the awful mystery that lay behind the</p><p> need for going out on the lake shook me and, had</p><p> any one touched me, suddenly, I am sure I should</p><p> have screamed.</p><p> “A hundred yards distant from the farther shore</p><p>we came upon the boat and drew alongside of it. It </p><p>was empty. Suddenly my eye caught sight of some- </p><p>thing white at the bottom of the boat, near the stern. </p><p>Pulling the craft along, I reached for the object. It </p><p>was a bit of muslin, torn from a woman’s dress, and </p><p>remembering that Mrs. Whipple had been wearing a </p><p>white dress that night, I turned sick. </p><p> When f lifted my hand from the gunwale of the</p><p>boat, preparatory to beginning a search that I knew </p><p>would be fruitless, I noticed that it felt sticky. It</p><p>Struck me as strange, since the boat had not been </p><p>lately painted. I was alxnit to dip my hand into the </p><p>lake, to wash it when a thought struck me. Lighting </p><p>a match-—for it was too dark to see anything clearly </p><p>—I looked to see what had befouled my hand. </p><p> “It was blood.</p><p> “Wilson had been watching me and. as I hastily</p><p>dipped my hand into the lake, with a shudder I </p><p>could not prevent, he asked, in the tone of one who </p><p>dreads the answer, ‘Was that—’ He didn't finish </p><p>- the question. I nodded and I felt the boat quivver as </p><p>a spasm of shaking seized him. </p><p> “We knew, but we continued to search—we and the</p><p>others, who had caught up with us. Although I was </p><p>ignorant as to what it was that had brought about </p><p>the death of three people, I was certain there was </p><p>something sinister and terrible in that lake of ours, </p><p>and I was afraid. </p><p> “When we dragged the lake, we found no bodies—</p><p>and I knew there would be nothing left to find. </p><p> “This ended our enterprise. One week after the</p><p>last accident found every cottage vacant. And no </p><p>wonder. Not only were the women wrought up to </p><p>the breaking point over the affair itself, but their </p><p>nights were made hideous by their dreams and the </p><p>infernal sound of that siren, whistle, or whatever </p><p>it was which grew increasingly worse. It was a - </p><p>heartshaking sound. </p><p> “After the last of our guests had packed up and</p><p>gone, Wilson and I determined to solve the mystery, </p><p>for we were convinced there was a mystery hidden </p><p>somewhere in that lake. </p><p> “Fortunately for us, nothing had been said con-</p><p>cerning the disappearance to arouse suspicion in </p><p>Hampton. It was known that some people had been </p><p>62 </p><p>AMAZING STOIUES </p><p>drowned, which was, of course, unfortunate, but not </p><p>unusual. And we did not further enlighten them. </p><p> "1 have no idea just what it was that suggested</p><p>a connection between the sounds that disturbed our </p><p>slumber and the happenings on the lake, but I found </p><p>myself associating them in my mind. Wilson, when </p><p>I mentioned it to him, scoffed at the notion. ‘How,’ </p><p>he asked, ‘could a noise tip a boat over?' and when </p><p>I tried to explain that the thing that made the noise </p><p>might be the cause, he wanted to know how a loco- </p><p>motive could leave its rails and accomplish such a </p><p>thing. You see, he had accepted as fact, the idea </p><p>that the sound we had been hearing emanated from </p><p>a mechanical contrivance. 1 told him my idea of the </p><p>situation and I 'm inclined to believe that he thought </p><p>1 had gone crazy, for when I asked him to put in a </p><p>night with me. trying to locate the noise, he refused. </p><p> “In deference to his opinion that the disturbance</p><p>could be traced to some engine. I made it a point to </p><p>investigate. The men were very courteous and </p><p>obliging, and blew the whistles of engines that </p><p>traveled over that stretch of the company’s right of </p><p>way, but none of them gave forth the sound, the </p><p>origin of which 1 was trying to discover. </p><p> “ I told Wilson about my findings, and when I told</p><p>him 1 was convinced the noise came from the lake, </p><p>he consented to stand watch with me, but I could </p><p>see that he took no stock in my belief. </p><p> "For three nights we watched but heard nothing,</p><p>and Wilson was ready to drop the matter. I had a </p><p>hard time getting him to go out the fourth night, but </p><p>grudgingly he came with me. </p><p> “Since the noises seemed always to have come</p><p>from the southwestern shore and, because it was </p><p>there the accidents had occurred, we had used that </p><p>as our watching post. Unlike the eastern shore, which </p><p>was open and fairly flat, the western side dropped </p><p>sharply down to the water. Some of the trees, their </p><p>footing broken away by the cave-in. lay flat in the </p><p>water, attached to the shore only by their roots, their </p><p>branches obscuring considerably the nearer reaches </p><p>of the lake. </p><p> “We found one tree which had rooted a little far-</p><p>ther back from the line of break, had therefore, part- </p><p>ly escaped the fate of its fellows. Held by its roots, </p><p>it reached out over the water, at an angle of some </p><p>twenty degrees. It was a large conifer and its tough </p><p>branches with broken limbs placed across them, af- </p><p>forded a safe and comfortable resting place, although</p><p>being out over the lake and with nothing to break the </p><p>wind, it was far from warm. As I have said al- </p><p>ready. the nights out there were cold. </p><p> “There were no dangerous land animals about, so</p><p>we carried no arms and, I feel sure any arms we </p><p>might have taken would have been useless against </p><p>the creature we were hunting. So. with a packet </p><p>of lunch and a thermos bottle of hot coffee, Wilson </p><p>and 1 set out for our point of observation. </p><p> “The night was clear, when we started from the</p><p>house, but,.after an hour or so, it began to thicken </p><p>and a mean, cold drizzle set in. We were warmly </p><p>dressed, however, so, aside from the ordinary dis- </p><p>comfort of damp skin, wherever it was exposed, we </p><p>suffered none. </p><p> “It was, as nearly as I could judge, (I didn’t think</p><p>of looking at my watch) about half past ten o’clock </p><p>when I was aroused from a half doze by an odd noise </p><p>that I could not for a moment classify. It woke me </p><p>up, however and now fully alert. I waited for a </p><p>repetition of the sound, i heard it again presently, </p><p>and this time I recognized the sound. It was a grunt, </p><p>a regular hog's grunt. If ii differed in any respect </p><p>from the familiar vocalizations one hears coming </p><p>from the pig-pens, 1 didn’t realize it at the moment, </p><p>although it did seem to be an unusually healthy grunt. </p><p> “My only feelings, as I remember, were those of</p><p>mild astonishment; not so much because I had heard </p><p>the grunt of a hog, (which might have escaped from </p><p>its pen and wandered down to the lake), but because </p><p>the sound came from the lake, and not from the </p><p>land. </p><p>fi'TNIERE is nothing in the sound of splashing </p><p>1 water to scare one. Yet, there by the lake, </p><p>with the cold drizzle wetting my hands and face, I </p><p>shivered when I heard that noise. </p><p> “Wilson, his back against a crotched branch, was</p><p>fairly asleep, (though he swore he wasn't) and I was </p><p>in the act of waking him when, like a blast from the </p><p>siren of an ocean liner, the most awful roar I ever </p><p>heard, tore through the night air, from out there in </p><p>the darkness, nearly shattering my ear-drums. </p><p> “It fairly brought me to my feet and, as for Wil-</p><p>son, if 1 had not been lucky enough to grab his coat, </p><p>as he was disappearing downward, through the </p><p>branches of the conifer, what happened to him later, </p><p>might have happened to him that night. </p><p> “I had only just recovered from my mental balance</p><p>and got Wilson back to safety when it came again.</p><p>And I knew it was the same screaming noise we had </p><p>been hearing all the time. And I knew also that that </p><p>noise was in some way responsible for the distressing </p><p>disappearances of our tenants, and 1 knew that the </p><p>originator of that sound was of enormous size. </p><p> “It would be difficult to adequately describe my</p><p>feelings, as I sat crouched there upon our none too </p><p>secure platform, peering out into the black darkness, </p><p>trying to discover what manner of creature it was </p><p>that had given voice to that soul-shaking scream. </p><p>Fear I knew, but there was something else beside </p><p>fear; something of unrecognized dread; perhaps a </p><p>premonition of some dreadful occurrence. And when </p><p>the splashing sound came nearer. I had to exercise </p><p>great self-control to keep from backing out of those </p><p>branches as quickly as possible and out of the neigh- </p><p>borhood. And Wilson, I believe, was even worse off, </p><p>for his teeth were chattering and he seemed dumb </p><p>with fright. </p><p> “Then the splashing noise gave way to another</p><p>sound, this time to a swishing, sucking sound, like </p><p>that made by an oar, pulled forcibly through the </p><p>water. Whatever that thing was, it was swimming, </p><p>not like our ordinary animal swims,—by moving its </p><p>legs—but. rather after the manner of a seal—by pad- </p><p>dling with flippers. And it was heading toward the </p><p>north end of the lake. </p><p> “As the sound of its movements through the water</p><p>came from directly in front of us, I dimly perceived, </p><p>like a vague, black shadow against a wall of black- </p><p>ness. a vast, undulating body. I could not make out' </p><p>its shape for there was not light enough, but I knew </p><p>it was enormous and, as I thought of it in connec- </p><p>tion with the terrible screams of those unfortunate </p><p>men and that helpless woman, the muscles of my </p><p>throat tightened and—I am not ashamed to admit it </p><p>—tears filled my eyes. Wilson apparently had been </p><p>following the same line of thought, lie was almost </p><p>un-nerved. and sat there picking at his fingers and </p><p>THE ANCIENT HORROR </p><p>63 </p><p>repeating, over and over, ‘Poor little woman! Poor </p><p>little woman!’ When I could stand it no longer, I </p><p>shook him and made him shut up. </p><p> “When the last of the monster’s shadow had</p><p>passed, we painfully rose from our cramped posi- </p><p>tion and crawled back to shore and started for home, </p><p>around the north end of the lake, hoping to get an- </p><p>other and, perhaps clearer view of the monster. But </p><p>we didn't catch sight of it again. Perhaps it changed </p><p>its course or, more likely, had sought its hiding place. </p><p> “I am not a drinking man but when we reached</p><p>the house and Wilson poured a stiff peg of liquor </p><p>for himself, I asked him to give me one too. And </p><p>we needed that drink if ever any drink was needed, </p><p>for we were pretty badly shaken up. </p><p> “It was long past our usual bed hour, but we didn't</p><p>feel very sleepy, although probably from force of </p><p>habit, I suggested turning in. Wilson, however, much </p><p>to my secret delight, refused to take any chances of </p><p>dreaming about that thing. ‘No, sir!' he said, ‘I'm </p><p>going to keep my clothes on and stay awake.’ So, </p><p>after another drink, we filled our pipes and prepared </p><p>to wait for daylight. </p><p> “ ‘What kind of a fish was that?’ Wilson’s ques~</p><p>tion aroused me from the train of thought into which </p><p>I had wandered and. my mind engaged, I replied, an </p><p>aquatic antique. This did not, of course, make things </p><p>any clearer for him so I asked if he knew anything </p><p>about the history of the earth, and the strange crea- </p><p>tures that had lived upon it, in ages long past. His </p><p>knowledge was very limited so, drawing on my mem- </p><p>ory of lessons learned years before, T tried to answer </p><p>his query in such a manner as to enable him to under- </p><p>stand the probable meaning of what we had seen. </p><p> “So far as repeating what I had read was con-</p><p>cerned, my task was simple. But any proper answer, </p><p>that is, one that would cover what we had dimly </p><p>glimpsed out there on the lake, required something </p><p>more! and I was obliged to resort to deductive rea- </p><p>soning in order to supply it. </p><p> “Briefly I told him that the age of the earth was</p><p>estimated to be between 860,000.000 and 1.000.000,- </p><p>000	years and that, according to the age of the rocks,</p><p>this great span of years was divided into ages, such </p><p>as the Azoic, followed by the Palaeozoic, Mesozoic </p><p>and Cenozoic. I told him that, accepting the idea that </p><p>roughly 1,000,000,000 years represented the earth’s </p><p>age, the Mesozoic era lay back of us some 500,000,-</p><p>000	of years. Then I told him, as well as I could,</p><p>what sort of monsters and giant reptiles inhabited </p><p>the earth and its water at the time; then, in an effort </p><p>to account for the monster in the lake, I drew upon </p><p>my imagination. Perhaps I guessed wrongly, but </p><p>1	know of no other way. For there is no record,</p><p>so far as I know, of any creature, except some of the </p><p>land species possibly, that could equal, in size, the </p><p>thing whose shadow we had seen. </p><p> “I am inclined to believe I was not far wrong be-</p><p>cause it is common geological knowledge that vast </p><p>continental changes were taking place at that remote </p><p>time, and basing my conjecture upon that fact, I told </p><p>him that during some of those tremendous upheavals, </p><p>certain ones of the reptile family had probably been </p><p>caught in some of the great caverns that were formed </p><p>and. unable to escape, had adapted themselves to </p><p>their changed environment. </p><p> “True it was, that this thing was different from</p><p>any species known, but is it certain that all the rep- </p><p>tiles that lived away back in those ages had been </p><p>classified ’ I wasn't at all certain that they had been, </p><p>so this creature might be a direct descendant of some </p><p>distinct and unknown class. Or, I thought it might </p><p>be possible that reptile might be some sort of </p><p>hybrid, bearing a composite resemblance to its an- </p><p>cient forebears. Why not? If you can crossbreed </p><p>asses and horses and get offspring which, though </p><p>unmistakably different from either of its parents, in </p><p>all essential features, resembles both, why could not </p><p>some similar sort of crossbreeding have occurred </p><p>with members of the reptile family? </p><p> “All sorts of fossil remains of pre-historic reptiles</p><p>have been discovered in North America, and those </p><p>creatures, when alive, lived here. Moreover, Amer- </p><p>ica, it is known, is fairly honeycombed with caverns, </p><p>some of enormous extent. Many have water in them; </p><p>although not sufficient, perhaps, to accommodate a </p><p>lizard as large as this particular one. Is it certain </p><p>that all the caverns have been discovered? </p><p> “Take this particular case for an example. When</p><p>the bed of the reservoir caved in. where did the water </p><p>go if,not into some vast cavern, or caverns? And, </p><p>had there not been such a cavern or caverns under </p><p>the bed of the creek, would there have been any </p><p>cave-in? Of course not. </p><p> -“Following this line of deduction, I came to the</p><p>conclusion that, in the subterranean depths, this rep- </p><p>tile, with perhaps many others, had been born and, </p><p>since even a lizard cannot live in water that is en-</p><p>tirely stagnant, inlets and outlets must have existed, </p><p>to keep the water, at least comparatively fresh. </p><p>tiQPACE alone, is limitless, so there must have </p><p> Obeen a limit to this cavern or caverns and,</p><p>when the water broke through from above, it was </p><p>filled to the point where the rock walls were burst </p><p>and the earth, having lost its support, fell, forcing the </p><p>water upward and forming the lake. When the water </p><p>reached a certain level, or was on a plane with the </p><p>bed of the creek, the reservoir filled up again, under- </p><p>ground, the outlet having been too small to carry </p><p>away the flow of the stream If my premise was cor- </p><p>rect, then the presence of the lizard in our lake was </p><p>easily accounted for. It simply came up through </p><p>the same hole through which the water came. </p><p> “That was the explanation I gave Wilson and I</p><p>thought, and still think, that it was correct. </p><p> “After breakfast I went to the north end of the</p><p>lake. I believed I had hit upon the real solution </p><p>of the reptile’s presence in the lake and wanted to </p><p>verify it if possible. I had an idea that the lizard </p><p>might take it into its head to come up from below, </p><p>and give me a chance to see it. I wanted Wilson to </p><p>accompany me but he said he had too much work </p><p>to do about the place. </p><p> “I waited near the hole until about noon, but</p><p>seeing no sign of it, I concluded that it had either </p><p>come up early or, what was more likely, was hiding </p><p>down there in the darkness, until nightfall. Instead </p><p>of turning homeward, however, I decided to settle </p><p>another question. For some time now. we had seen - </p><p>no trout jumping and I thought they might have </p><p>been frightened out of the lake and returned to the </p><p>reservoir. Wilson and I, although we did not know </p><p>until the night before, just what had caused the ac- </p><p>cidents, thought it better to go without fish than to </p><p>take any risks out on the lake. But if they were in </p><p>the reservoir again I meant to catch a few. </p><p> “The knoll, or mound, about which I told you in</p><p>64 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>ilie beginning, lay directly between me and the reser- </p><p>voir and, since it was easy to climb, 1 started up its </p><p>side. It was covered with low brush and weeds that </p><p>hid the surface of the ground from view, but did </p><p>not greatly impede my progress. I plowed my way </p><p>to the top and started across the rounded back, to- </p><p>ward the reservoir. I had gone only a few paces </p><p>when, without warning, the ground gave way beneath </p><p>my feet and 1 soon found myself, in a heap, in the </p><p>gravel, at the bottom of what seemed to me to be </p><p>an over-sized cistern. </p><p> “1 was not injured but I was considerably shaken</p><p>up, for 1 had fallen about ten feet. For a moment </p><p>1 was inclined to laugh at myself, for I cut a funny </p><p>figure sitting there, hunched up. But there was noth- </p><p>ing to laugh at. 1 found myself in a serious position, </p><p>for I was imprisoned at the bottom of a hole, sur- </p><p>rounded by unscalable walls of loose gravel. More- </p><p>over, no one had seen me at or near this isolated </p><p>place, so unless a miracle happened, no one ever </p><p>would come in time to find me alive. Well, sitting </p><p>there, staring at the opening through which I had </p><p>fallen would'do no good, so I began to take my sur- </p><p>roundings into serious consideration. </p><p> “It soon became evident that the hole had been</p><p>dug by some one for a definite purpose; what that </p><p>purpose was I had no idea. The opening at the top, </p><p>I discovered, had been covered with planks which, in </p><p>the course of a short time had become covered with </p><p>earth and vegetable matter; in turn this furnished </p><p>soil in which had grown the weeds that hid the spot. </p><p>None of the boards had fallen into the hole, nor was </p><p>there anything I could use to enable me to reach the </p><p>opening. As there was nothing else I could do, I </p><p>decided to kick gravel from the walls and heap it up </p><p>until the pile was high enough to enable me to reach </p><p>beyond the broken boards, grasp some bush, or other </p><p>thing, and get out. </p><p> “I knew I had a tedious job ahead, for I had only</p><p>my hands to use as a shovel. At one side of the </p><p>hole, quite a pile of gravel load fallen of its own </p><p>weight, which gave me a good start. I thought. </p><p>Throwing double handfuls into the center of the </p><p>floor soon proved to be a bad job. My hat also </p><p>proved too slow a method, so I spread my coat, filled </p><p>it. then carried it over to the slowly growing mound, </p><p>on which I dumped these accumulations. </p><p> “I had a heap about three feet high when, in</p><p>scooping up another double handful, my fingers came </p><p>in contact with the surface of a box. I soon had it </p><p>uncovered fully and found it to be about a foot deep,</p><p>fifteen inches wide, and about two feet long. I was </p><p>about to kick the cover off. in order to find out what, </p><p>if anything, it contained, when I was moved to ex- </p><p>amine it a little more closely first. It was a good </p><p>thing I obeyed the impulse, because, after carefully </p><p>prying off the cover, which had begun to show signs </p><p>of dry rot, I discovered a two gallon cannister of </p><p>nitro-glvcerine. </p><p> “The reason for the hole became apparent at once.</p><p>It had been used as a chamber for explosives while </p><p>the reservoir was in process of construction, and this </p><p>box very likely had been overlooked when the work </p><p>was finished. </p><p> “Very carefully I carried it over and laid it on its</p><p>side, on top of the little heap of gravel. Digging </p><p>further I found another box, and another, until I </p><p>had found fifteen. I piled these, pyramid fashion, </p><p>under the hole through which I had fallen; then </p><p>holding my breath and taking care not to make a </p><p>false step, 1 climbed to the top and soon found my- </p><p>self in the sunshine once more where 1 could breathe </p><p>freely. </p><p>SfTI THEN I reached the reservoir, I found the </p><p>VV trout jumping. The fish problem settled, I </p><p>started back toward the house for my tackle. I was </p><p>about half the way to the fence when I saw Wilson, a </p><p>long stick in his hand, trying to head off a cow that </p><p>had broken from the corral, and was now headed for </p><p>the lake. </p><p> “Mules are supposed to be, and are, stubborn, but</p><p>when it comes to downright ‘orneryness,’ I think a </p><p>cow is pretty much of a fool. Added to this, cows </p><p>are nervous things, ready to stampede at a moment's </p><p>notice and when they get a notion into their heads, </p><p>you can’t club it out. </p><p> “Now, this cow was a Holstein, and valuable so,</p><p>when Wilson saw her heading for the lake he very </p><p>naturally objected, considering the sort of tenant </p><p>that lake harbored. </p><p> “I was too far away to be of assistance and the</p><p>beast was too much for him alone. Dodging past his </p><p>swinging club, she drove, head on, for the water, her </p><p>tail, so it seemed, flapping, in derision. She was still </p><p>on the gallop when she reached the water, so she </p><p>went entirely under. I saw her come up, a few yards </p><p>from the bank and, cow-wise, start for the farther </p><p>shore. I don’t know why a cow will always, under </p><p>similar circumstances, make for the farthest point, </p><p>unless it is because as I said, they are just plain </p><p>fools. </p><p> “In his anxiety over his cow, Wilson forgot some-</p><p>thing he should have remembered: if the lake was a </p><p>dangerous place for the Holstein, it was even more </p><p>dangerous for him. But he may never have thought </p><p>about the lizard at all. At any rate he ran to the </p><p>little dock that projected out into the water, and, </p><p>getting into the boat that was tied there, began to </p><p>row frantically after old bossy. </p><p> “I was too far away to warn him of his danger,</p><p>although it didn’t actually seem great then; the lake, </p><p>like a great blue gem bathed in the golden rays of the </p><p>afternoon sun, suggested nothing further than </p><p>dimpled beauty, made somewhat sinister by the </p><p>knowledge that, deep down in its sapphire depth there </p><p>had been, and might at the moment be, a nameless </p><p>and monstrous horror. I guess I have become a bit </p><p>of a fatalist; it seems to me, things are pretty much </p><p>laid out for us from the beginning. We are sup- </p><p>posed to be ‘free moral agents,’ according to the </p><p>clergy, yet I wonder if we really are. Of course, </p><p>Wilson did not have to go out on the lake. Nor </p><p>would he have gone if he had stopped to think. But </p><p>blame can hardly be attached to him for not stopping </p><p>to think. He never did. </p><p> “By the time I reached the spot where the cow</p><p>went into the water, the animal was about a hundred </p><p>yards from shore, headed back, for Wilson had over- </p><p>taken her and made her turn back. There wasn’t a&gt; </p><p>thing to be nervous about, so far as appearances </p><p>went, but I was worried, and I urged him to hurry. </p><p>He waved his hand and nodded and that was the </p><p>last thing he ever did. His hand had barely grasped </p><p>the oar again when, silently, from the blue depths, </p><p>there came into view, just behind Wilson, the awful </p><p>head and neck of the creature, whose shadow we had </p><p>dimly seen that night, when we sat crouched on a </p><p>THE ANCIENT HORROR </p><p>65 </p><p>shaky platform spread over the branches of the fal- </p><p>len conifer. </p><p> “Up it rose, to a height of seven or eight feet,</p><p>while I, gazing upon its utter frightfulness, stood </p><p>paralyzed and dumb. I saw its cavernous mouth, </p><p>fully three feet from snout to the angle of the jaw; </p><p>saw it open and reveal its gleaming, needle sharp </p><p>teeth over the head of the unfortunate man; and I </p><p>was utterly helpless. If my own life had been at </p><p>stake, I could not have uttered a cry of warning. </p><p> “I think Wilson must have sensed something,</p><p>somehow, for I noticed (I can see that look even </p><p>now) a look of fear spread over his rugged features. </p><p>But it was too late for, just as he was in the act of </p><p>turning his head to see what was behind him, the </p><p>end came. There was a slight working of the ter- </p><p>rible jaws, perhaps due to some sort of gustatory sug- </p><p>gestion of the thing’s instinctive machinery, then, like </p><p>a flash, down came the obscene head, the jaws closed, </p><p>with a snap and Wilson, only his legs protruding be- </p><p>yond the lizzard’s snout, was snatched from his seat </p><p>with the speed and ease with which a hen picks up </p><p>a kernel of corn. </p><p> “Horror unspeakable overpowered my mind, and</p><p>I think I lost consciousness for a moment. Maybe I </p><p>went mad for a time, for I have no remembrance of </p><p>having gone to the house, nor, until awakened by a </p><p>terrific crash of thunder, did I. have a realization that </p><p>anything had taken place. </p><p> “When I regained my senses, I sat slumped over</p><p>in one of the kitchen chairs. I felt dazed, like one </p><p>who has been on a long drunk. Shadows of strange </p><p>memories passed through my mind, suggesting noth- </p><p>ing definite. Then another frightful crash swept the </p><p>cob-webs from my brain and 1 felt memory coming </p><p>back with a rush. </p><p> “Other things came quickly, and perhaps for-</p><p>tunately, to occupy my mind, and demand my atten- </p><p>tion, for one of the worst storms I had ever wit- </p><p>nessed, was brewing fast and furiously. The house, </p><p>stout though it was, trembled and creaked beneath </p><p>the onslaught of the elements gone wild. </p><p> “Getting up from the chair I staggered to the win-</p><p>dow. The sky was overcast with heavy clouds, those </p><p>immediately overhead being a grayish black, while, </p><p>down in the southwest an unearthly, greenish mass </p><p>of whirling cumuli, writhed and twisted, high up in </p><p>the heavens. That there were several currents of </p><p>air, coming from as many different directions was</p><p>evident, from the manner in which the tops of the </p><p>trees behaved. They fairly threshed about. Pres- </p><p>ently the temperature began to drop and great clouds </p><p>from the northwest drove- past, beneath the blackness </p><p>far overhead, and then the flashes of lightning be- </p><p>came appalling, as the fire forks darted from cloud </p><p>to cloud, while deafening peals of thunder sent every </p><p>loose thing a-rattle. </p><p> “Then the rain came; came in torrents that were</p><p>veritable cascades of driven water, beating in at every </p><p>crack and crevice. There was a blinding flash a </p><p>hundred yards from the house and a tall tree, </p><p>splintered into kindling, flew in all directions; this </p><p>the gale whirled and tossed about, finally driving it </p><p>into the lake, the surface of which was beaten into </p><p>froth. </p><p> “I heard a crash overhead and knew the chimney</p><p>had gone by the board. This was followed by a rip- </p><p>ping sound, and the roof of the chicken house, look- </p><p>ing like the flapping wings of some enormous bird, </p><p>went sailing away across the lake; and when the </p><p>house itself began to slide upon its foundation I </p><p>expected it to follow. It did not, however; neither </p><p>did it lose its roof, although, as I discovered later, </p><p>there wasn’t a whole shingle left on it. </p><p> “Suddenly the hideous racket was augmented by a</p><p>sound that over-rode all other noises. Every win- </p><p>dow pane was shattered; every door was driven from </p><p>its hinges, while through the openings, a deluge of </p><p>water rushed, flooded the house and knocked me </p><p>into a corner. </p><p> “I have heard about the ‘Crack of Doom’ many</p><p>times, and, if it is going to be any worse than that </p><p>crack, I don't want to hear it. However, it seemed </p><p>to serve one useful purpose, for after it came, the </p><p>awful racket began to subside and, within the hour, </p><p>only an occasional rumble bore evidence of energy </p><p>still at work. The rain continued, however, until it </p><p>seemed the oceans were being drained to furnish the </p><p>water. </p><p> “Wet, cold and weary, I waded through the water</p><p>that swashed back and forth through the lower </p><p>rooms, to the stair leading to the second floor. I </p><p>dragged my aching body up the stairs, down which </p><p>little streams trickled, for the windows, upstairs, </p><p>also were shattered. I went from room to room, </p><p>seeking some place of shelter out of the wind, where </p><p>I might perhaps find some dry clothing and lie down. </p><p>The second floor was pretty well soaked but I found </p><p>shelter at last, in a large closet in the rear. This </p><p>part of the house was toward the east and since the </p><p>storm had come from the southwest and north, it was</p><p>comparatively dry there. In this closet I found Wil- </p><p>son’s Sunday suit, some shirts and a pair of shoes, </p><p>together with a few pairs of socks. The suit was </p><p>too small, and the shoes too large, but I was in no </p><p>position to be particular, so I put them on. Unless </p><p>you have been in a similar predicament, you cannot </p><p>know the comfort of dry clothing of any kind or </p><p>make. </p><p> “After wringing out my own. clothes and hanging</p><p>them over the backs of chairs to dry if the rain ever </p><p>let up I piled, some things on the floor and, upon </p><p>these, for a bed, I soon forgot all about the storm </p><p>and what had gone before it. </p><p> “A ray of sunlight on my eyes, reflected from a</p><p>mirror, awoke me. My watch had stopped, so I </p><p>didn’t know just what time it was, although I judge </p><p>it must have been about nine o’clock. I was a bit </p><p>stiff and hungry, but otherwise, in pretty good shape. </p><p>After drawing the chairs, over which my clothes </p><p>hung, into the sunshine, I went down stairs, dug the </p><p>wet ashes out of the stove, made a fire and cooked </p><p>some ham and eggs' and coffee for myself. Then </p><p>I started out to learn the extent of the damage. </p><p> “There was plenty. The roof' of the barn had</p><p>fallen in, driving the walls outward. Luckily the </p><p>weather had been warm, so the cattle were still kept </p><p>outside. I found them at last, in a small apple </p><p>orchard, apparently no worse for having been out </p><p>in the storm, contentedly eating grass. I say had </p><p>been, because practically every one of the trees had </p><p>been ruined, the branches having been torn off. </p><p> “Then, for no particular reason, I strolled down</p><p>to the lake. Except for a lot of floating shingles, </p><p>branches and boards, it was the same, smiling, beau- </p><p>tiful blue body of water—the last place in the world, </p><p>I thought, where such terrible tragedies could take </p><p>place, and the most unlikely hiding place for the </p><p>horror that had caused the events. Soon I became </p><p>aware of a muffled sound like a rushing of water </p><p>66 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES . </p><p>over a fall, and wondered what caused it. A little </p><p>later, I noticed that the floatsani was drifting toward </p><p>the north end of the lake. This was odd. since there </p><p>was no current and, curious to learn why, I started </p><p>in the same direction. Soon the muffled sound be- </p><p>came louder. It was coming from the lake! Puzzled </p><p>for a moment, like a flash the explanation came to </p><p>me and I started north on the run. </p><p> “I soon reached the place where the noise came</p><p>from—a great rent at the end of the basin in which </p><p>the lake lay. I looked toward the mound, or, rather, </p><p>toward the place where the mound had been, for it </p><p>was there 110 longer, and if I had been in doubt as </p><p>to what had caused the rent, I was soon in possession </p><p>of full knowledge. That unearthly crash had been </p><p>caused by the explosion of those fifteen cases of </p><p>nitro-glycerine, and there may have been more buried </p><p>in the sand, when a streak of lightning found its way </p><p>into the pit in which they were. </p><p> “The rocky floor of the pit must have been a sort</p><p>of pot cover, over the subterranean cavern, or </p><p>caverns, and the force of the explosion had torn it </p><p>away rending the rocks and earth into a great tear, </p><p>extending through the wall which held the lake. It </p><p>had done even more; it tore out the wall between it </p><p>and the reservoir, for I found, upon going around </p><p>the chasm to the dam, that the water was rapidly </p><p>lowering. While I stood there, amazed at the force </p><p>of the charge, a large block of concrete from the </p><p>end of the dam nearest me, broke loose and fell with </p><p>a splash, into water. Evidently, I thought, the whole </p><p>dam was being undermined and was liable, at any </p><p>moment, to fall. I made haste to get away from the </p><p>place, and I acted wisely, for within ten minutes the </p><p>whole enormous structure of concrete crumbled and </p><p>fell; a part of it going completely out of sight in the </p><p>hole in the bed of the reservoir, while the rest went </p><p>in the opposite direction. </p><p> “It was apparent, since the chasm was enlarging</p><p>momentarily, that it would not take long to empty </p><p>both reservoir and lake and. being minded to see the </p><p>finish, I went back to a point of safety, on the east- </p><p>ern shore, sat down 011 a rock and waited for the end. </p><p>ffQITTING there, wondering into what profound </p><p> O	depths the waters of the lake and reservoir</p><p>were plunging, speculating upon the possible truth </p><p>of some tales I had read concerning people discovered </p><p>living in a ‘World Beneath a World,’ I forgot, for a </p><p>time, what was taking place before my eyes. </p><p> “I was aroused from my reverie by a snort, and</p><p>coming back to actualities, I looked to see what had </p><p>produced it. There was the great lizard, from whose </p><p>throat it had emanated, not fifty yards before me. </p><p> “At last I saw the monster, and monster it truly</p><p>was. My powers of description are far too limited </p><p>to adequately describe that monster. Its body, at </p><p>least the upper part, was fully exposed. Swan-like </p><p>in shape, it appeared to be nearly sixty feet from </p><p>the point where the neck joined the body, to the end </p><p>of its tail, which resembled, in a way, the tail of a </p><p>duck. This body, armed or equipped with flappers, </p><p>similar to those of a seal, but enormously larger, was </p><p>a greenish black and was covered with what might </p><p>have been, the slime and ooze of ages. Its neck, </p><p>flexible as that of the swan, was fully two feet in </p><p>diameter at its base, tapering slowly to the head, </p><p>eight feet from the body. The head was a com- </p><p>posite of the crocodile and the tyrannosaurus, but </p><p>much larger, with loosely articulated jaws, permit- </p><p>ting of tremendous extension, as is the case with </p><p>certain snakes. The mouth, armed with teeth fully </p><p>six inches in length, was at least three feet long from </p><p>the snout to the angle of the jaws. To add to its </p><p>frightfulness, the upper canine teeth, or fangs, </p><p>curved outward and downward over the lower jaw, </p><p>and were, as near as I could judge, at least ten </p><p>inches long. A more horrible creature I couldn’t </p><p>imagine, and I wondered whether it might be a </p><p>member of some species that had never been cata- </p><p>logued. or whether it was what it appeared to be, </p><p>a hybrid. I think it was the latter and. since it was </p><p>the only one that had come into the light of modern </p><p>times, I also wondered if the thing could have begun </p><p>its existence away back there in the mesozoic era. </p><p>It seemed impossible, and yet, who knows. At any </p><p>rate it certainly looked ancient enough to have been </p><p>born long before creation began. Doubtless, I </p><p>thought, there were others like it, somewhere, for </p><p>it seemed unlikely that only one specimen would have </p><p>been caught in one of the cataclysms of those an- </p><p>cient days. But, whether or not I was right, can </p><p>never be told. </p><p> “Apparently the lizard was terrified at something;</p><p>probably at the idea of being sucked into the chasm, </p><p>into which the water was pouring, for it was mak- </p><p>ing violent efforts to draw away from that end of </p><p>the lake. It was a losing game, however, for the </p><p>suck of the water, powerful as was the reptile, was </p><p>too strong and, thresh the water as it might, and did, </p><p>it was slowly being drawn back. Whatever else </p><p>might be said of the lizard, it was no coward, for, </p><p>realizing the fact that it was a losing game, it sud- </p><p>denly turned and, with a terrific bellow, using its </p><p>flippers to accentuate its speed, in a sort of ‘devil</p><p>daring spurt,’ it drove head-long into the vortex. </p><p> “During the day the waters continued to enlarge</p><p>the chasm and, by night the lake had nearly vanished, </p><p>as had also the reservoir. </p><p> “The following morning the city engineers were</p><p>out, and as well as I could, I explained what had hap- </p><p>pened. As it chanced, I did most of my talking to </p><p>the man who had supervised the construction of the </p><p>reservoir, and was therefore the only one who knew </p><p>about the nitro-glycerine. I realized that my knowl- </p><p>edge of its presence in the pit caused him some </p><p>worry, and he explained that he had given orders for </p><p>its removal, but they evidently had been forgotten </p><p>or disregarded by the workmen, so I told him I would </p><p>not mention the matter to anyone, for which he </p><p>seemed very grateful. Since it could have done 110 </p><p>good to tell about it then, I deemed it best to forget </p><p>about the matter. </p><p> “But I mentioned the lizard to 110 one. I ex-</p><p>plained the disappearance of Wilson, by telling them </p><p>that he had fallen into the lake, from a rowboat, </p><p>while trying to drive back to the shore a cow that </p><p>had gone into the water. That also was the story I ^ </p><p>told the lawyers who settled up the estate. </p><p> “As soon as possible I gathered up my traps and</p><p>came back to the city. I have tried to forget the </p><p>experience, for it was far from pleasant, but this </p><p>story in the paper brought it up again and, I repeat, </p><p>I shall not be surprised to read that those men have </p><p>found some hold-Over from the mesozoic era, for I </p><p>believe there are specimens still alive. Why not? </p><p>THE END </p><p>•7*- MASTER KEY </p><p>by Charles S. Wolfe </p><p>“A master key for a boh," Fenner said quietly.

Fenner here, Mr. Watson, is </p><p>the man I think you want. Tell him your story. </p><p>You’ll excuse me, for I'm rather busy this morning.” </p><p>Davidson left us, and as we seated ourselves </p><p>across the table from Watson, I began studying him </p><p>covertly, for he was a well-known figure around our </p><p>town. Son of one of the wealthiest of our citizens, </p><p>he was prominent in all the big social activities of </p><p>the “upper set,” and a member of all the exclusive </p><p>clubs. His name was constantly appearing in the </p><p>public prints, and I made the most of this oppor- </p><p>tunity to get a line on the man. </p><p> He spoke in low, cultured tones, not looking di-</p><p>rectly at us, and toying with a paper knife in a </p><p>nervous fashion as he talked. </p><p> “I find myself in a most embarrassing situation,</p><p>Mr. Fenner,” he said, "and Davidson tells me that </p><p>he is unable to give me any assistance, because the </p><p>matter cannot be considered as legitimately in his </p><p>line. I suppose he's right. Also, I admit that I </p><p>am showing poor sportsmanship in asking aid in </p><p>this business, but you will understand that it is </p><p>not the money involved that leads me to unfair play. </p><p>I am in a fair way to become the laughing stock </p><p>of the city, and at all costs this must be prevented.” </p><p>“And what is the difficulty, Mr. Watson?” Fenner </p><p>asked politely, as the clubman paused. </p><p> “It is a silly bet that I was foolish enough to</p><p>make at the Lynx Club with young Fair yesterday </p><p>afternoon. We were discussing some of the popular </p><p>books of the day, and finally worked around to a </p><p>detective story which is having quite a run. Maybe </p><p>you’ve read the thing—chap is murdered in a room </p><p>to which there is no apparent ingress possible with- </p><p>out detection—that sort of stuff. I remarked that </p><p>all this kind of business was drivel—that in every- </p><p>day life such things could not, and did not, take </p><p>place. Young Fair, with all the romanticism of </p><p>youth, defended the writer and his clan. Said that </p><p>things occur in reality that outdo the marvelous </p><p>happenings of fiction. The dispute grew rather </p><p>hotter than either of us liked, and—well, we ended </p><p>in a bet. </p><p> “Fair offered to bet me five thousand dollars that</p><p>he personally could demonstrate to a selected com- </p><p>mittee that the mysterious entrance or exit from </p><p>a room as described in this book was quite possible. </p><p>I accepted the wager. </p><p> “The committee was selected, and the conditions</p><p>agreed on. He was to enter a room from which no </p><p>unaided exit could apparently be made. He was </p><p>to be allowed the entire night in which to effect </p><p>his escape. If he succeeded, I agreed to find him </p><p>within 48 hours, and to explain how he got away </p><p>or forfeit the wager. </p><p> “The arrangements were made, and he entered</p><p>the chosen room at eight last evening. This morn- </p><p>ing we forced an entrance to that room. He has </p><p>disappeared!” </p><p> Fenner made no effort to conceal his grin. “Put</p><p>one over, eh? Any idea how he managed it?” </p><p>“Not the slightest,” confessed Watson, dejectedly. </p><p>“Apparently it is impossible. Yet he is gone. Mv </p><p>forty-eight hours are slipping away rapidly, and it </p><p>seems as if I am slated to lose. I don’t regard the </p><p>money at all, you will understand. I. would give the </p><p>little devil that much if he asked for it. It is the </p><p>idea of having the young jackanapod hoodwink me </p><p>in this fashion that makes me determined to find </p><p>him if I can. Yet I haven’t any idea where to </p><p>begin. Now 1 am making you this offer. Solve this </p><p>riddle for me, and the money I win you may have. </p><p>Of course, I rely on you to keep secret the fact </p><p>that you aided me.” </p><p> “That's a pretty stiff condition,” objected Fen-</p><p>ner, “for how I am to get a look at the scene of </p><p>this mysterious disappearance without someone not- </p><p>ing my presence there, and how I am to trace the </p><p>movements of Fair without following any trail he </p><p>may have left without seeing it, is more than I can </p><p>imagine.” </p><p> “That you can easily do,” returned Watson. “The</p><p>selected room was in the Commercial House. This </p><p>morning we forced the door, doing some little dam- </p><p>age. I told the proprietor that I would send work- </p><p>men around to make the necessary repairs. You </p><p>may represent yourselves as locksmiths without </p><p>arousing any suspicion.” </p><p> “Right,” Fenner agreed, cheerfully, “and now,</p><p>Mr. Watson, give me a concise account of Fair’s last </p><p>movements.” </p><p> “We finally chose a room on the twelfth floor.</p><p>Fair accepted this room without comment, and it </p><p>suited me. It opens into a long corridor, which </p><p>leads to the elevator. It is much like the other </p><p>rooms on that floor. The reason that it appealed </p><p>to me was that it was situated quite a distance from </p><p>the fire-escape. In fact, it is inconceivable that Fair </p><p>passed out through the windows of the rooms.”</p><p>“Granting that he had nerve to venture out over </p><p>the abyss, couldn’t he reach the roof ?” queried Fen- </p><p>ner, quietly. </p><p> Watson shook his head in negation. “Three stor-</p><p>ies above, is the out-jutting cornice,- you know. Prac- </p><p>tically no hand or foothold on the surface of the </p><p>wall. I don’t imagine a cat could make it. I think </p><p>we can eliminate the windows. The hotel proprietor </p><p>assures me that there are no secret passages, spaces </p><p>between the walls or anything of that sort in the </p><p>building. I take his word for it. Now as to the </p><p>doors. There are two. The one leading into the </p><p>room from the corridor by which Fair entered, and </p><p>one within the room in the left wall, leading into an </p><p>adjoining room, which also has a door opening into </p><p>the corridor. </p><p> “Both these doors have ordinary locks, not dead</p><p>latches. For this reason, I suppose, they have also </p><p>bolts. There is a bolt on the inside of the door </p><p>which opens on the corridor, and a bolt on the door </p><p>within the room. There is a bolt on the other side </p><p>of that door, by the way, within the adjoining room. </p><p>I looked this morning. And for the occasion, we </p><p>put a bolt on the outside of the corridor door. </p><p> “When Fair entered the room we shot this out-</p><p>side bolt. He shot the one on the inside. That’s why </p><p>we had to force our way in this morning. That bolt </p><p>on the inside was still in place. So also were both </p><p>bolts on the other door. And there you are.” </p><p>Fenner arose. “Your description of the condi- </p><p>tions is good, Mr. Watson,” he said, “and now Bill </p><p>and I will become locksmiths and go down and see if </p><p>we can do anything for you. If T am able to help </p><p>you out, I'll call Davidson on the ’phone.” </p><p> “Do that,” agreed Watson, “and remember, the</p><p>money is all yours if you can successfully unravel </p><p>this mystery.” </p><p>THE MASTER KEY </p><p>69 </p><p> Fenner nodded, and we passed out. leaving Wat-</p><p>son seated at the table. As we passed through the </p><p>outer office, Davidson favored us with a wink and </p><p>a grimace to which Fenner replied by forming with </p><p>his hands a very creditable imitation of the long </p><p>ears of a mule. </p><p> We made our way to Fenner’s house, attired our-</p><p>selves in working clothes, took a few- tools, and </p><p>caught a downtown car. As we rode, I ventured to </p><p>question Fenner, hoping that he might have a pos- </p><p>sible solution to the riddle. He proved non-com- </p><p>mittal. </p><p> “Wait. Bill," he said, “until we have had a first-</p><p>hand look at the scene of this fourth-dimensional </p><p>chap's activities. Let us form no theories until we </p><p>know all that is to be known about the case.” </p><p> “Watson's description was quite lucid,” I replied,</p><p>“and if things are just as he described them, the </p><p>trick seems impossible to me. Fair couldn’t have </p><p>flown, you know.” </p><p> “No matter how impossible it may seem,” rejoined</p><p>Fenner, “you are face to face with the fact that </p><p>when they broke into the room this morning Fair </p><p>was gone." That, I take it, is proof enough that it is </p><p>quite possible. Here we are.” </p><p> On stating our errand to the manager, we had</p><p>no trouble in securing admission to the room, and </p><p>the departing bell-hop left us alone in the room from </p><p>which Fair had contrived to find an exit. </p><p> The damage to the door was trivial and Fenner</p><p>set about making the few necessary repairs. “You </p><p>search carefully. Bill,” he said, as he applied him- </p><p>self to the task of replacing the torn off bolt and </p><p>its keeper, “and make sure that our young friend is </p><p>not here, disguised as a bed or a clothes tree.” </p><p>Ignoring the banter, I did make a thorough ex- </p><p>amination of the room, having come to the conclu- </p><p>sion 011 the way down that Fair might just possibly </p><p>have remained in the room, avoiding detection by </p><p>some clever expedient. </p><p> My efforts were fruitless, however, for a search</p><p>convinced me that he could not possibly be in hiding </p><p>within the room. </p><p> Conditions were just as described bv Watson.</p><p>There was no disorder or sign of unusual physical </p><p>effort to suggest a possible answer to the enigma. </p><p>A glance out of the window assured me that Watson</p><p>had spoken the truth. Just to fancy a human being </p><p>clinging to the surface of that wall at that height </p><p>was sickening, and I felt convinced that Fair had </p><p>not made the fire-escape. Yet the bolted doors </p><p>seemed proof that he had not passed through either </p><p>of them, for it is possible to lock a door after you. </p><p>but hardly so to shoot a bolt inside of a closed </p><p>door. Also the fact that there w-ere bolts on the out- </p><p>side of each of these doors made it look like a rather </p><p>difficult proposition for him to have opened them at </p><p>all, let alone having bolted them behind him. </p><p> The ceiling, examined from the vantage point of a</p><p>chair, was as fruitless of clues as the previously </p><p>scrutinized floor. </p><p>“And now.” said Fenner, after these details had </p><p>been attended to. “we will take a leaf from Wat- </p><p>son’s book, and have a look at the adjoining room.” </p><p>Bv means of an ordinary skeleton key we readily </p><p>got into this chamber through the corridor door. I </p><p>prepared myself for another thorough search, but </p><p>Fenner stayed me, “No use, Bill,” he said; “let’s </p><p>go.” </p><p> Mystified, and a little rebellious, I followed him</p><p>from the room, and we made our way to the street. </p><p> As we walked along, Fenner hummed softly under</p><p>his breath. </p><p> “It wouldn’t have done any harm to have taken a</p><p>look around that room,” I grumbled, “on the off </p><p>chance. While he’s not likely there, we might have </p><p>made sure.” </p><p> “Nor would it have done us any good. Ah!</p><p>there’s a telephone booth. Wait here until I get </p><p>Davidson and kiss that five thousand good-bye.” </p><p> “Are you giving it up?” I demanded, amazed and</p><p>hurt. “Let's go back and have another try.” </p><p> “Not on your life,” said Fenner, grimly. “Lead</p><p>us not into temptation. If I go back there I may be </p><p>tempted to collect that money.” </p><p> “You’ll never collect it this way,” I demurred.</p><p>“My boy, I don’t want to collect it.” retorted Fen- </p><p>ner. “I don’t need money that badly. Watson’s a </p><p>short sport, or he would have seen this thing through </p><p>himself, and not asked to buy the brains which he </p><p>apparently lacks. Fair, on the other hand, has proved </p><p>himself the possessor of some real gray matter. Get </p><p>me? I'm going to be something of a good sport </p><p>myself and not give him away.” </p><p> I laughed, shortly. “Give him away,” I echoed.</p><p>“I hardly think you will!” </p><p> Fenner stopped short in his tracks, nettled. “Say,</p><p>you ass,” he said, sharply, “you don’t think I’m - </p><p>stumped, do you? Let me tell you something, fel- </p><p>low. I know where that lad is at this very moment.” </p><p>“You do?” I yelled. “Then where in blazes is </p><p>he?” </p><p> “In that room that.I wouldn’t let you search, my</p><p>bov,” rejoined Fenner, complacently, gratified by </p><p>my startled expression. “That’s why I literally </p><p>dragged you out. I didn’t want you to flush the poor </p><p>lad and spoil it for him. He was in that big closet, </p><p>sticking out his forty-eight hours.” </p><p> “He was?” I demanded, in amazement. “How</p><p>did he get through that bolted door?” </p><p> “Easiest thing in the world,” chuckled Fenner.</p><p>“A cinch. He had the MASTER KEY.” </p><p> “A master key for a bolt?” T demanded incred-</p><p>ulously. </p><p> “A master key for a bolt,” Fenner said quietly.</p><p>"A nice lit lie electro-magnet and some lamp cord. </p><p>Simple, wasn’t it. Hook right into the lamp socket </p><p>and shoot the bolts about at will. He figured, and </p><p>rightly enough, that the fact that all those bolts </p><p>were found safely in their keepers would ward off all </p><p>suspicion that he merely stepped into the adjoining </p><p>room. He was right when he told Watson that </p><p>things happen in every day life that are stranger </p><p>than fiction. Maybe that worthy will believe him </p><p>now.” </p><p> “Good night!” I murmured, dazedly. “I never #</p><p>thought of that method—never suspected the trick.” </p><p>“I did,” replied Fenner, “and just the moment </p><p>that I saw those bolts were of steel and not </p><p>brass, I knew that T was right. Gee! Couldn’t we </p><p>have rigged up some station with those five thou- </p><p>sand iron men!” </p><p>THE END </p><p>Tfe RETURN OF THE MARTIANS </p><p>by Cecil B. White </p><p>1 was suddenly bathed In a greenish glow and on the screen before me there appeared an image of my figure as seen from the front. </p><p>Suddenly the chest of my protecting suit seemed to be sliced away in the figure, then the flash appeared. . . . Gradually the section </p><p>plane cut deeper and deeper into my body until the lungs, heart and stomach were shown in section. </p><p>THE RETURN OF THE MARTIANS </p><p>71 </p><p>CHAPTER I </p><p>ITTLE did I dream, when I penned the </p><p>account of Dr. Hargraves’ epoch-making </p><p>discovery under the title of “The Re- </p><p>treat to Mars,” which appeared in the </p><p>August issue of this publication, that </p><p>even more astounding events were to take place </p><p>within a few short months. </p><p> Soon after I had forwarded the narrative to the</p><p>Editor, I received a telegram from Washington, </p><p>signed by Hargraves, asking me to come at the earli- </p><p>est possible moment. Naturally, it was not long </p><p>before I was on my way in response to his request, </p><p>for I knew that my friend would not call me away </p><p>from my work without good reasons. Moreover, my </p><p>expenses were to be paid, and that appealed to my </p><p>Scottish blood! </p><p> Hargraves met me at the depot on my arrival in</p><p>Washington and whisked me away to his apartment </p><p>at once. No mention, other than that it was some- </p><p>thing big, was made of the cause of his telegram, </p><p>until I was comfortably settled in his study, after a </p><p>good hot .shower and a general clean-up necessi- </p><p>tated by my journey. . </p><p> When we were snugly ensconsed in front of a</p><p>comfortable open fire, my host took a pile of fools- </p><p>cap and drawings from a side table, and laying them </p><p>on his knee, he leaned back in his chair and began: </p><p> “I have here a translation of one of the volumes</p><p>contained in the library and need the assistance of a </p><p>psychologist and an astronomer to work out de- </p><p>tails of tlie apparatus described here and, afterwards, </p><p>in the operation thereof. It is nothing less than a </p><p>signaling apparatus with which we can get into com- </p><p>munication with the Martians—that is, if they are </p><p>still there,” he added. “It is really a type of radio </p><p>transmitter, but to me it appears to be totally new </p><p>in principle. Knowing that you are a radio enthusi- </p><p>ast and that you have done much work on the sub- </p><p>ject, I secured permission to get you to oversee the </p><p>construction of the apparatus and assist me in get- </p><p>ting in touch with the Martians. There are many </p><p>men in Washington who would be glad to give an </p><p>arm for the opportunity I offer you, but many of </p><p>the secrets disclosed in the </p><p>transcribed library are to </p><p>become government prop- </p><p>erty. and you will see, </p><p>there are some that will </p><p>be of inestimable value to</p><p>the country holding them. </p><p>For this reason, we prefer </p><p>to call in one who has </p><p>already proved himself </p><p>trustworthy. If you ac- </p><p>cept the appointment and </p><p>pledge yourself to secrecy, all the information that </p><p>you need will be placed at your disposal. The neces- </p><p>sary money for the experiment will be granted with- </p><p>out demur, although we have made but the roughest </p><p>estimate of the cost as yet. You will be granted a </p><p>salary which, I think, will be satisfactory to you, </p><p>while you are engaged in the work. Will you accept </p><p>the appointment ?” </p><p> “I should say I will accept!” I exclaimed. “It is</p><p>no use my telling you how delighted I am that you </p><p>should have given me this opportunity. There is a </p><p>young chap just coming along and attending Uni- </p><p>versity w^lio will be only too glad to carry on in my </p><p>absence. I will get him to take over my share of </p><p>the observing while 1 am away.” </p><p> “We will settle things tomorrow, then,” said Har-</p><p>graves. “I will take you over to see the ‘Chief,’ </p><p>who will make all the necessary arrangements. You </p><p>can go over this translation and the diagrams, which </p><p>I have had copied, this evening after dinner—it's </p><p>nearly time for that now. Like to take a glance at </p><p>the drawings before going in?” </p><p> I took the proffered papers and glanced at the</p><p>diagrams. As Dr. 1 largraves had intimated, the </p><p>ideas were new to us. Though it would be classed </p><p>as a radio transmitter, it was totally different to any- </p><p>thing I had ever seen before. Gone were the famil- </p><p>iar valves and oscillating circuits, they were replaced </p><p>by purely mechanical methods of setting up the ether </p><p>disturbances. The instrument was directional, send- </p><p>ing out a beam that deviated from parallelism by an </p><p>extremely small amount, hence the output of the </p><p>arrangement was conserved, necessitating but a mi- </p><p>nute fraction of the power that would be required to </p><p>operate even the most efficient of our beam trans- </p><p>mitters. </p><p> During dinner we discussed the probability of our</p><p>signals being heard. According to Hargraves, the </p><p>Martians had erected permanent receivers at various </p><p>points on the planet, connected with an alarm and </p><p>recording system, so that as soon as the Earth re- </p><p>plied to the long-delayed message, the inhabitants </p><p>of the other planet would know that we had at last </p><p>found their gift to us. They had promised that </p><p>the receivers would remain in place and in order, as </p><p>long as there was the slightest chance that the Earth</p><p>would reply. </p><p> At-the conclusion of the meal, we again repaired</p><p>to the doctor’s study and there I read the instructions </p><p>for making the receiver and the transmitter. With </p><p>all the facilities that were to be placed at my dis- </p><p>posal, T knew that it would not be long before the </p><p>first signal would be directed towards its goal. I </p><p>could not understand the fundamental principles on </p><p>which the operation of the apparatus was based, but </p><p>from references given in the text I learned that 1 </p><p>would find them elucidated in another volume; Har- </p><p>graves promised to have this translated for me </p><p>immediately. </p><p> The following morning</p><p>I was introduced to Dr. </p><p>Smythe, the head of the </p><p>department under which I </p><p>was to work, and arrange- </p><p>ments were quickly made </p><p>that were satisfactory to </p><p>all concerned. With three </p><p>assistants I set to work </p><p>without losing any time </p><p>and in a few days the in- </p><p>struments were well under way. The work was </p><p>carefully apportioned among the three men so that </p><p>no clue as to the exact nature of the apparatus they </p><p>were constructing could be obtained by any one of </p><p>them, and the secrets of the instruments could not </p><p>leak out. As it came to me, part by part, I carefully </p><p>checked them over from the original specifications </p><p>and assembled them into the components of the fin- </p><p>ished transmitter. Gradually I began to understand </p><p>the exact nature of the power used, and as I studied </p><p>the works referred to in the text of the instructions, </p><p>T learned how to adjust and operate the apparatus </p><p>when in operation. </p><p> 'JT'IIOSE of our readers who have read “The Retreat</p><p> -* to Mars" will be interested in the present story,</p><p> which Is a sequel thereto. Mr. White, the author, who</p><p> is an astronomer, is so well informed about this subject,</p><p> that zee read with bated breath, his most unusual, as</p><p> well as powerfully written story. Many things are</p><p> brought out here, which, very likely, the average reader</p><p> never realizes, yet the story is not technical at all. On</p><p> the contrary, it will hold the interest of practically every</p><p> reader, no matter what his inclinations may be.</p><p>72 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> As soon as the transmitter was completely assem-</p><p>bled, Hargraves and I left Washington for the west </p><p>coast, where my observatory is located, to install, </p><p>test and adjust it. A powerful telescope was needed </p><p>to direct the beam of the transmitter to the far dis- </p><p>tant receivers, and the necessary instructions for its </p><p>construction and its operation were given. We had </p><p>advanced more than far enough to take care of this </p><p>part of the work ourselves, so these instructions </p><p>were only read in a cursory manner, though they </p><p>contained several new and far-reaching ideas that </p><p>would repay later study. It was unnecessary to </p><p>construct an instrument specially for this work, as </p><p>the one I owned in my observatory was powerful </p><p>enough, and, with the slight modifications we were </p><p>able to make, we could use it in conjunction vyith the </p><p>transmitter. The receiver lacked a few minor parts </p><p>when we left Washington, and these were to be </p><p>forwarded to us as soon as they were finished. </p><p> The projector was connected to the telescope in</p><p>due course, all other work being suspended, and was </p><p>adjusted so that the axis of projection was parallel </p><p>to the optical axis of the telescope. This adjustment </p><p>was very delicate for, as I mentioned before, the </p><p>beam was practically non-divergent and, as the area </p><p>it would cover on the planet’s surface would subtend </p><p>a solid angle of but four seconds of arc, the greatest </p><p>care had to be taken in making this adjustment. We </p><p>had also to ascertain the effects of flexure of the </p><p>telescope tube in different positions and to make a </p><p>table of the necessary corrections to be applied to </p><p>eliminate this error in setting. </p><p> Through some misunderstanding, the parts for</p><p>the receiver had not arrived by the time we were </p><p>ready to make our first attempt to communicate with </p><p>Mars. Nevertheless, we decided to make an attempt </p><p>at letting our neighbors know that we were at last </p><p>ready to communicate with them. </p><p> Anxiously we watched the sky the afternoon be-</p><p>fore the actual test took place, but it was cloudless </p><p>and there was every indication of a good night. </p><p>I checked up my computations carefully, so that I </p><p>was sure that there were no mistakes in the position </p><p>of the points to which the telescope had to be directed </p><p>in order that the signals might reach the Martian </p><p>receivers. It was necessary, of course, to direct </p><p>the beam to a point where the receiver would be </p><p>when the signals reached the planet—the velocity of </p><p>the radio waves being finite. Three factors had to </p><p>be taken into consideration on directing the beam. </p><p>The first was that the planet was not where we </p><p>observed it to be for, due to the finite velocity of</p><p>light, the planet was somewhat ahead of the point </p><p>where it was observed, the amount depending upon </p><p>the relative positions and distances of the Earth and </p><p>Mars in their orbits; then again the time that the </p><p>signals would take to reach the planet had to be </p><p>taken into consideration. The second correction was </p><p>due to the refraction a beam of light suffers on enter- </p><p>ing our atmosphere except when coming vertically </p><p>downward, this phenomenon making an object ap- </p><p>pear higher in the heavens than it really is. The </p><p>third factor has already been mentioned, that due </p><p>to the flexure of the telescope tube. </p><p> Two o’clock found the planet high enough in the</p><p>southeast to warrant the attempt. The seeing was </p><p>fair and with a power of six-hundred it was not </p><p>difficult to set on the computed position. Hargraves </p><p>pressed a key of the twelve-keyed keyboard used </p><p>and a single long dash was sent on its way, hurtling </p><p>with the speed of light towards its goal, 82.000,000 </p><p>miles away. </p><p> The Martian code is difficult to describe without</p><p>entering into it fully. It was sent with the aid of </p><p>twelve keys, each key altering the characteristic form </p><p>of the “carrier-wave.” The keys could be pressed </p><p>in combinations, with the result that a competent </p><p>operator could send a message almost as fast as </p><p>speech. Hargraves had become quite an adept with </p><p>it and I had made a little progress, but not enough </p><p>to transmit well. That was left to my companion. </p><p> Following a series of calling dashes, Hargraves</p><p>sent off the following communication: </p><p> “We have discovered the library that was left by</p><p>your pioneers after their attempt to colonize this </p><p>planet had failed and, according to the instructions </p><p>left for the discoverers, we are attempting to estab- </p><p>lish communication with you. Do not reply to this </p><p>message, because our receiver has not yet been in- </p><p>stalled. We will inform you when we are ready. </p><p>We are now going to repeat the signals to another </p><p>receiving station in case this is not heard. We are </p><p>transmitting from a point on the Earth which co- </p><p>ordinates 78.856 and 19.440 N.” - </p><p> The coordinates that Hargraves gave in his mes-</p><p>sage were obtained from one of the Martian maps </p><p>made during their stay on this planet. It must be </p><p>remembered that any translation that can be made </p><p>from the Martian language into our own, must, of </p><p>necessity, be decidedly free. The two languages have </p><p>nothing in common, only the thought-forms can </p><p>be given. For this reason, the above is but a free </p><p>translation of the messages sent hurtling through </p><p>space to the planet of mystery at the rate of 186,000</p><p>miles per second. </p><p> The call signal was repeated four times, and four</p><p>times the same message was sent out that night, </p><p>each time to a different receiver, in the hope that </p><p>one of them, at least, would reach its destination. </p><p>We would have to wait until the remainder of our </p><p>receiver arrived before we could learn if we had </p><p>been successful or not. </p><p> Four days later the receiver was completed and</p><p>was rapidly installed, but much to our chagrin the </p><p>night was cloudy and never once did we catch a </p><p>glimpse of the planet, although the telescope was </p><p>kept pointed to it throughout the night and the </p><p>eyepiece was never left for an instant when there </p><p>was the slightest chance of catching a glimpse of it. </p><p> The following night was more favorable, and we</p><p>were able to see the planet long enough at a time </p><p>to allow a setting to be made on the computed posi- </p><p>tion and to send our call out once more, this time </p><p>followed by a short announcement to the effect that </p><p>we were ready to receive. </p><p> For fifteen minutes, in which time a returning sig-</p><p>nal should have reached us, we waited anxiously. </p><p>Minute by minute passed without a single sound </p><p>emanating from the receiver phones, with which we </p><p>were both equipped. _ Our attempt, we thought, had </p><p>failed. Again we tried, and for a few minutes, the </p><p>clouds parted long enough for us to train the beam </p><p>on a second station. Again we waited anxiously, </p><p>but no reply was heard. Clouds prevented us from </p><p>making another attempt that night, and with the </p><p>dawn we closed up, filled with disappointment. </p><p> I awoke about eleven o'clock to hear Hargraves</p><p>calling me. He entered at my answer and in his </p><p>hand he held a copy of a late edition of the morning </p><p>paper. </p><p>THE RETURN OF THE MARTIANS </p><p>73 </p><p> “Look at this,” he said, pointing to one of the</p><p>front page column heads. This is what I read: </p><p>Radio Experimenter Claims to Have Heard </p><p>Message From Mars </p><p> Calgary, Alta.—Robert Eastwood, a radio ex-</p><p> perimenter of this city, claims to have heard</p><p> signals last night which he believes to have come</p><p> from an extra-terrestrial source. The signals,</p><p> Mr. Eastwood states, were extremely faint and</p><p> were heard when he was measuring static in-</p><p> tensity at different wave-lengths. The amplifier</p><p> consisted of six stages of audio frequency, pre-</p><p> ceded by a very sensitive detector of his own</p><p> invention. The signals were likened to the</p><p> whistle heard in a regenerative receiver and, as</p><p> his detector cannot oscillate, they could not be</p><p> due to that cause. They were badly distorted</p><p> by the high amplification used.</p><p> It seems most likely that these were the har-</p><p> monics of some commercial transmitter rather</p><p> than what Mr. Eastwood claims them to be,</p><p> though he is most emphatic in his denial of this</p><p> possibility.</p><p> “Have I made a mistake in the position of the</p><p>receiver that I gave them?” I exclaimed, jumping </p><p>out of bed and hurrying to the den in my dressing </p><p>gown. “No,” I replied to my own question, “there </p><p>has been no mistake. I wonder if those signals were </p><p>meant for us.” </p><p> “A very strange coincidence if they were not,”</p><p>replied my companion. “Can the Martians have made </p><p>a mistake in our position or an error in their </p><p>direction ?” </p><p> “Hardly likely,” I exclaimed. “Wait a minute,</p><p>though, I have an idea.” Going to the telephone I </p><p>called the meteorological observatory, the director </p><p>of which is a friend of mine, and asked for a report </p><p>on the general cloudiness of the night before. The </p><p>reply was what I expected—Clouds covered the </p><p>northwestern States and western Canada as far east </p><p>as the Great Lakes; the general conditions over the </p><p>western hemisphere, north of the tropics, were </p><p>cloudy. Evidently the Martians could not get their </p><p>bearings well enough to direct their beam to the </p><p>correct position for it must be remembered that we </p><p>were on the unilluminated side of the Earth. East- </p><p>wood had heard the signals intended for us, we </p><p>thought. </p><p> The cloudy spell broke that afternoon, leaving us</p><p>with a clear sky. Full of expectation, we sent our </p><p>signals out once more as soon as the planet was in </p><p>position. Twenty minutes after our first call, the </p><p>headphones, with which we were both equipped, </p><p>clattered violently, causing us to remove them. Re- </p><p>ducing the intensity, we replaced them and Har- </p><p>graves commenced to put into shorthand, the mes- </p><p>sage that roared through. </p><p> “Train upon the Elysium receiver.” commanded</p><p>my companion, after the phones had ceased sound- </p><p>ing. I rapidly computed the new setting point and </p><p>directed the telescope thereon. </p><p> At my “All set,” another message was sent out.</p><p>Guiding the telescope, as I was, I had no idea of </p><p>what was going out or coming in. I would have to </p><p>wait until we were all through before I could learn </p><p>the context of the messages. </p><p> It was the biggest thrill I had ever experienced as</p><p>I sat back there on the observing ladder, with my </p><p>eyes glued to the binocular eyepiece and my fingers </p><p>on the slow motion controls with which I corrected </p><p>the slight irregularities of the driving clock. Now </p><p>and then the image would be blurred by a wave of </p><p>poor seeing, and I would strain to hold the cross </p><p>wires on the point on which I was guiding, my </p><p>landmarks having disappeared in the general blur. </p><p> Two hours were taken uji in this way, without a</p><p>break other than was necessary to turn the dome or </p><p>shift the ladder, as the rotation of the Earth carried </p><p>the planet across the sky. Eventually Hargraves </p><p>made the cryptic remark, “Well, that’s that! All </p><p>through, old man. Come and get some coffee and </p><p>have a smoke; you need it. I’ll read this out to you.” </p><p>I was glad of the respite, for the strain had been </p><p>great and my eyes and head ached with the intensity </p><p>of my efforts. </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>IT would take up too much space in this account </p><p>to repeat the messages sent and received, word </p><p>for word. The reader who wishes to read the </p><p>exact messages will find them published in the spe- </p><p>cial bulletin issued by my observatory. </p><p> Our first message was to the effect that we had</p><p>attempted to communicate with them the preceding </p><p>night and were now ready to receive. Then we </p><p>reported that signals had been heard by an experi- </p><p>menter in another locality, some three hundred miles </p><p>away, and inquired if these emanated from their </p><p>transmitter. At this we stood by for the return</p><p>message, which, as you know, nearly deafened us </p><p>with its intensity. The message ran as follows: </p><p>“Congratulations. We were expecting the library </p><p>to be found about this time. Our observations </p><p>showed that it was still where we left it. We heard </p><p>all your signals; they were quite strong and well </p><p>directed. It is unfortunate that you did not hear </p><p>us last night; the error was ours. Conditions at </p><p>our transmitting station were none too good, and </p><p>this, combined with the masking of the lights of </p><p>your cities by dense clouds, caused an error to be </p><p>made. You were evidently just outside the beam. </p><p>Tell us how the discovery of the library came about. </p><p>Now transmit to us for 0.0049 day*—during this in- </p><p>terval we will transmit to you. then stop to receive </p><p>the message, which will take that time to reach you. </p><p>In this way no time will be lost.” </p><p> Following the receipt of this message, Hargraves</p><p>sent to our Martians an account of his deductions </p><p>and the resulting discovery of the library. A few </p><p>moments after his conclusion, the phones sounded </p><p>again and a communication of about seven minutes’ </p><p>duration was received. This was followed by others </p><p>at intervals of the same length. My companion’s </p><p>messages were accounts of the progress of civiliza- </p><p>tion on this planet and need not be recorded here. </p><p>The following is an abstract of those received: </p><p>Shortly after the Retreat to Mars, another un- </p><p>foreseen catastrophe overtook the Martians. The </p><p>survivors of the expedition, unknown to them, car- </p><p>ried the seed of death back to the parent planet. All </p><p>known diseases had long since been eradicated from </p><p> ♦The decimal amounts to nearly seven minutes. The Mar-</p><p>tians, being unaware of our system of measuring time were </p><p>compelled to adopt this method of conveying the time inter- </p><p>val to us. This system is used a great deal in astronomical </p><p>work for, as will be seen, it facilitates computation consid- </p><p>erably. </p><p>74 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>the planet Mars, but the returning pioneers carried </p><p>with them a new and more malignant enemy than </p><p>had heretofore been encountered. This did not </p><p>attack those who carried it back with them, as their </p><p>special physique and the acclimatization to which </p><p>they had been subjected, had rendered them immune </p><p>to it, even though they were carriers. Within a year </p><p>of the return of the survivors, the wonderful sys- </p><p>tem of the Martians was sadly disorganized; over </p><p>half the population were dead or dying from the </p><p>awful plague which swept over the planet like a </p><p>scourge. Despite their knowledge of bacteriology </p><p>and medicine, the plague continued unchecked until </p><p>no more than one hundred and fifty of the original </p><p>millions of the planet's teeming population were </p><p>left alive. All these were survivors of that ill-fated </p><p>expedition to the Earth. </p><p> A stupendous task confronted the survivors. Men</p><p>of their calibre could not stand by and see all that </p><p>they had gained lost without a struggle. To the </p><p>everlasting credit of those heroes of the past, let it </p><p>be said that the loss was small and the Martians of </p><p>today have them to thank for the advanced position </p><p>they hold. Picture, if you will, the problem before </p><p>them. The survivors, few of whom were scientists, </p><p>as they understood the term, had to set to work to </p><p>educate their offspring and to inoculate them with </p><p>the high ideals held by the vanished Martian com- </p><p>munity. The sciences which were first stressed were </p><p>those of fundamental importance to the economic </p><p>life of the race. They included biology, chemistry </p><p>and engineering in all its branches, all the applied </p><p>sciences which were vital to the perpetuation of the </p><p>race. </p><p> It must be remembered that the planet was fast</p><p>losing its water supply and that the first thing to </p><p>do was to continue the operation of the vast works </p><p>already constructed to conserve the planet’s vital </p><p>fluid. Truly a tremendous task for so few. </p><p> A century later saw the planet’s population in-</p><p>creased to a little over twenty thousand inhabitants. </p><p>These were divided into district groups, each group </p><p>being responsible for the upkeep of all the state </p><p>machinery within its borders—a tremendous task, </p><p>for much of the apparatus and plants had suffered </p><p>from neglect during the early part of the century. </p><p>Thanks to the alloy—which we have called arenium </p><p>—that was used in its construction, corrosion and </p><p>oxidation did not affect the pumping machinery of </p><p>the water conservation system; in many places, </p><p>though, neglect had played its part in rendering </p><p>inoperative many of the great public power plants.</p><p> The social system, that had been developed before</p><p>the cataclysm, held steadfast throughout the greatest </p><p>trials that any system could be subjected to, and </p><p>never once did it waver throughout the darkest times </p><p>the planet ever knew. It must be said, however, </p><p>that the survivors and their descendants continued </p><p>with the desperate remedy, instituted long before, </p><p>of eliminating all who would or could not work </p><p>under their system, thus saving the unity of the </p><p>whole at the expense of a few. </p><p> Under these adverse conditions, it is not to be</p><p>wondered at that the Martians made no progress. </p><p>Until they discovered how to conquer the subtle dis- </p><p>ease that ever threatened them, little advance was </p><p>made in any of the sciences except bacteriology and </p><p>medicine. Eventually, the corps of workers who </p><p>were continually engaged with the problem discov- </p><p>ered the means of eradicating the loathsome disease, </p><p>which was akin to leprosy. From that time their </p><p>advance had been slow but steady. </p><p> It will be of interest to my readers, 1 think, to</p><p>record here the report we received on the reception </p><p>of our first signals. The first receiver we had </p><p>trained on was one located in the Solis Lacus region, </p><p>the time there would correspond to about 2 P. M. </p><p>here. This particular receiver was located in an </p><p>observatory and the quiet of the afternoon had been </p><p>broken by the mellow sound of the alarm, followed </p><p>a few moments later by a second. Immediately the </p><p>members of the observatory staff were in a state of </p><p>suppressed excitement; the Earth had awakened </p><p>from her long lethargy. Connections were at once </p><p>made to all the public annunciators and before the </p><p>message came through, the whole of the planet knew </p><p>that the Earth was in communication with them at </p><p>last. The direction indicators that were at once </p><p>applied, gave them the position of our transmitter. </p><p>They recognized that the signals were coming from </p><p>a building they had always suspected of being an </p><p>observatory. A few minutes later the second re- </p><p>ceiver, the one in the region we call Arcadia, sounded </p><p>its alarm and the second message—a repetition of </p><p>the first, was received. </p><p> 1 was somewhat surprised at the fact that the</p><p>Martians admitted showing excitement at the re- </p><p>ceipt of our signals, for I had thought that the </p><p>emotions would have become practically non-existent </p><p>with the high development of the Martians. We </p><p>learned later that they had wisely preserved these </p><p>emotions, some being developed even. Had this not </p><p>been the case they would have become machine-like </p><p>automatons and this state was looked upon by them </p><p>with horror; only the undesirable had been</p><p>eliminated. </p><p> On the conclusion of our inter-communication,</p><p>they asked us to call them the following night as </p><p>there was an important problem under discussion </p><p>and they expected to give us some interesting in- </p><p>formation. </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>THE following night the skv cleared about </p><p>eleven o’clock, much to our relief, and re- </p><p>mained clear throughout the rest of the night. </p><p>Fifteen minutes after our calling signal had been </p><p>sent out, the answer arrived. As the message came </p><p>through, I heard Hargraves exclaim, “Good Lord!” </p><p>and then relapse into silence. Imagine my curi- </p><p>osity! The message ceased and- Hargraves turned </p><p>to me with the question, “How would you like a </p><p>trip to Mars?” </p><p> “Are you joking?” I asked in amazement. “No.</p><p>I am not,” he replied. “The opportunity is offered </p><p>to us. Do you accept ?” </p><p> “Of course I accept,” T answered at once. “How</p><p>is the journey to be made?” </p><p> “I’ll tell you later, it you are sure you want to</p><p>go. We can take two others along with us. T am * </p><p>going.” With that he turned to the keyboard and </p><p>sent a short message. </p><p> In a few minutes the Martian signals commenced</p><p>again, and continued for the space of perhaps thirty </p><p>minutes. When they ceased, mv companion said, </p><p>much to my surprise. “That is all for this time.” </p><p> “What is wrong?” T asked, for we had arranged</p><p>to ask quite a number of questions in the hope of </p><p>solving some of our individual problems. “You </p><p>THE RETURN OF THE MARTIANS </p><p>75 </p><p>haven’t actually sent out all that stuff, have you?” </p><p> “No need to,” was his reply. “We arc going</p><p>there to find things out first hand.” </p><p> “When?” I asked.</p><p> “In about fifteen days,” Hargraves informed me.</p><p>“Listen to this.” 1 sat on the steps of the observ- </p><p>ing ladder while he read the message lie received. It </p><p>ran as follows: </p><p> “Since receiving your first signal, we have been</p><p>considering which would be the best method of </p><p>learning all we can from you, as well as instructing </p><p>you in all the things that we think will be of value </p><p>to you. It has been decided that the best method </p><p>will be for you to visit us during the coming con- </p><p>junction of your planet. To this effect we will send </p><p>you one of our space machines to bring you to this </p><p>planet. As you probably know, we are not able to </p><p>withstand the extra strain to which our bodies are </p><p>subjected on the Earth, so that we are not able to </p><p>stay for any length of time. Moreover, we do not </p><p>wish to run the risk of bringing disease back to our </p><p>planet again, so we believe it will be best for you to </p><p>come here with our representatives in the machine </p><p>that will be sent for you. You will understand, we </p><p>feel sure, that it is necessary for us to safeguard the </p><p>health of this planet above all things, hence you will </p><p>not feel that you are subjected to indignities, if </p><p>special precautions are taken for our protection. </p><p> “The constitution of the atmospheres of the two</p><p>planets is nearly identical, so that you will suffer no </p><p>inconveniences in that respect though the pressure </p><p>will have to be increased for you. We will supply </p><p>you with protective coverings in which the pressure </p><p>can be kept suitable to your well-being. We would </p><p>like to obtain as comprehensive a collection of your </p><p>books on social, engineering and scientific subjects as </p><p>possible. If you can obtain these for us, let us </p><p>know.” (Hargraves informed them that this could </p><p>be done.) </p><p> “If you consent, the machine will leave here as</p><p>soon as it is equipped and should arrive at its des- </p><p>tination in fifteen days’ time. We desire you to be </p><p>prepared by then, as it is not advisable that our </p><p>envoy stay on the Earth any length of time. If </p><p>these arrangements are suitable for you, let us know. </p><p>We will resume in five minutes.” </p><p> When Mars is in opposition to the Earth, the</p><p>Earth is in conjunction with the sun to observers</p><p>on Mars. </p><p> At this juncture Hargraves sent the message sig-</p><p>nifying our assent to the Martian plans. During </p><p>the interval that had to elapse until our message </p><p>was received, the following came through: </p><p> “You may wonder whether we have visited the</p><p>Earth throughout the ages that have passed since </p><p>our first experience there. We have, several times, </p><p>but we found the conditions not ripe for any attempt </p><p>to communicate with you. Consternation and terror </p><p>was manifested by those that saw us even one hun- </p><p>dred years ago, our year being equal to 687 of your </p><p>days, 669 of ours; since then, however, you have </p><p>evidently made rapid progress. The rapidity of </p><p>your recent advancement shows that your men of </p><p>science, at least, are breaking away from the savage </p><p>superstition that always surrounds a race in its </p><p>development. You have learned, we believe, the </p><p>great lesson that, because a thing or phenomenon is </p><p>not understood, it is not necessary to call in un- </p><p>natural or supernatural explanations to account </p><p>for it.” </p><p> Then came a brief pause followed by:</p><p> “Your acceptance of our offer has been received.</p><p>It will be as well for you to prepare a store of pro- </p><p>visions to last you at least fifty days, in case that the </p><p>food which we can supply proves unsuitable for you. </p><p>In case you have perishable supplies, we will pro- </p><p>vide methods of preserving them. Our machine will </p><p>‘land’ on the water of the landlocked bay due south </p><p>of your observatory, unless you inform us that it </p><p>is inadvisable. It will aid the pilot if you mark your </p><p>position with a large white banner with a black </p><p>circle upon it. Kindly be prepared to board the </p><p>machine at once. Unless you have some important </p><p>question to put to us, or information to give us, </p><p>this will be the last time we will communicate with </p><p>you, until we see you here on this planet. We will </p><p>close this communication by wishing you an inter- </p><p>esting and profitable voyage to this parent planet </p><p>of yours.” </p><p> “Well, old man, what do you think of that?”</p><p>said Hargraves, as he concluded reading the </p><p>messages. </p><p> “I don’t know what to think of it,” I replied. “It</p><p>seems more like a dream than reality. I’ll believe it </p><p>to be true when the Martians arrive.” </p><p> “I feel somewhat like that myself,” said my com-</p><p>panion. “It does seem too remarkable to be true. </p><p>However, I guess we had better send a wire to </p><p>Washington for those books, if they are to be here</p><p>in time. We have plenty to do before we leave. </p><p>Now, then, who are to be the other two that will </p><p>accompany us?” </p><p> “1 would like to take my wife along. I am sure</p><p>she would like to go,” I said. “We should take a </p><p>member of the gentler sex along with us, anyhow, </p><p>don’t you think so?” </p><p> ‘‘Of course, she must come along with us,” was</p><p>Hargrave’s comment. “Who else?” </p><p> “Nay. That is up to you,” I replied. “I suppose</p><p>that one of the Washington people should go. They </p><p>made this thing possible.” </p><p> "I think that I will leave it to Smythe to select</p><p>the fourth member. I’ll wire him right away,” said </p><p>Hargraves. </p><p> The following days kept us busily employed, for</p><p>there were many preparations to be made. My wife </p><p>had agreed to accompany us after only a moment’s </p><p>hesitation, and many of her suggestions were exceed- </p><p>ingly useful to us. The books arrived from Wash- </p><p>ington with a day to spare. There were nine large </p><p>crates of them. I wondered if there would be room </p><p>for them all in the space flyer. </p><p> The fourth member of our party was Dr. Smythe</p><p>himself. He decided to accompany us as soon as </p><p>he read Hargrave’s telegram. He had taken the </p><p>greatest interest in Hargraves’ work and read the </p><p>Martian language as well as the discoverer of the </p><p>library could. He would be an exceedingly useful </p><p>member of the party. </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>NATURALLY we were all on the qui vive on </p><p>the day that the Martians were expected, </p><p>and never before were the heavens watched </p><p>with greater excitement. At about three o’clock, </p><p>a dark speck was sighted in the blue which rapidly </p><p>became larger, revealing it to be a machine—evi- </p><p>dently the one we expected. After a long spiral </p><p>glide, the machine struck the water in a cloud of </p><p>76 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>spray. It was traveling at a high rate of speed— </p><p>about two hundred and fifty miles an hour, I judged </p><p>—when it landed, and shot along to the dock, where </p><p>wc waited. We had marked our position, as we </p><p>had been directed. Luckily, the dock, which be- </p><p>longed to a marine engineering firm, was deserted, </p><p>for it was Saturday afternoon and the employees </p><p>had left. Only the watchman was present, besides </p><p>ourselves, as the space flyer swung alongside. The </p><p>machine was about one hundred and twenty-five feet </p><p>long, with a diameter of perhaps thirty feet. It </p><p>was torpedo-shaped, with single wings, and a span </p><p>of a good hundred feet formed the supporting sur- </p><p>faces when in the air. It had the familiar rudder </p><p>and elevators, but it lacked any visible means of </p><p>propulsion. </p><p> A large glazed port swung inwards as we pulled</p><p>the machine to the dock, disclosing a figure which </p><p>at first glance appeared to be clad in old-fashioned </p><p>armor. He was a giant, fully nine feet tall and, if </p><p>one could judge from his protecting armor, with a </p><p>chest like a barrel. His head was enclosed in a </p><p>transparent globe, which fitted into the neck-piece of </p><p>his covering, permitting us to see the smile of greet- </p><p>ing upon his rather handsome features. His fore- </p><p>head was broad and high, and his head was crowned </p><p>with a mass of curly chestnut hair. </p><p> What the watchman thought, I do not know, but I</p><p>heard a gasp and a “Lor’ lumme!” from him. We </p><p>had told no one of the intended visit. </p><p> As our little group approached the open port, the</p><p>giant handed us a sheet of material upon which some- </p><p>thing was written. Hargraves read it and turned to </p><p>us, saving, “Bring the baggage to the edge of the </p><p>dock." With the aid of the watchman, we trundled </p><p>the cases up to the machine on a hand truck that </p><p>we had borrowed, and as each piece was brought tfp, </p><p>a jointed arm, built up on the lazy tongs principle, </p><p>shot out and clasped it. whisking it away into the </p><p>interior of the machine. In a very short time all </p><p>our effects were on board and we followed. </p><p> We found ourselves in a broad passageway tra-</p><p>versing the craft, at the opposite end of which was </p><p>a second glazed port similar to the one that now </p><p>swung to behind us. The space was half full of </p><p>the baggage that had come aboard. Leading aft was </p><p>another smaller passage, and down this we were led </p><p>by our guide. Four compartments opened off from </p><p>this alley and we were directed into one of them. As </p><p>we entered, there came a rushing sound and the </p><p>machine began to plough slowly through the water.</p><p>Through the broad glazed windows of the cabin we </p><p>saw the dock slide by. The sound grew to a roar </p><p>and the water slipped past us faster and faster, until </p><p>our view was obscured by a dense cloud of spray. </p><p>Suddenly the spray cleared and we saw the surface </p><p>of the water dropping rapidly away from us. We </p><p>were aloft and swinging northward at an enormous </p><p>speed over the harbor. </p><p> The land dropped away and the topography of</p><p>Vancouver Island unfolded itself below, its lakes </p><p>appearing like little gems glittering in the sunlight. </p><p>Northward we flew, ever climbing. Soon we /could </p><p>descry the smoke of Vancouver, lying like a pall </p><p>over Burrard Inlet, and the Fraser River winding </p><p>eastward into the distant hills. Ever climbing at a </p><p>terrific rate, we sped over the mountains while the </p><p>fjords of the coast appeared below us and the Queen </p><p>Charlotte Islands rose out of the blue Pacific to the </p><p>northwest. </p><p> So great was our pace, that the land, many miles</p><p>below, could be seen swinging by like a panorama. </p><p>We were up in the rare atmosphere and the roar of </p><p>the driving jets, as I supposed it to be. gradually </p><p>diminished in intensity with the lessening atmos- </p><p>pheric pressure until presently it was but a faint </p><p>murmur. Gradually, even this faint sound faded </p><p>out as we passed beyond the limits of the earth’s </p><p>envelope and the familiar blue of the sky gave way </p><p>to the blackness of interstellar space, studded with </p><p>its brilliant suns. </p><p> The cabin was now brilliantly lighted by circular</p><p>transluscent plates on the walls and ceiling, behind </p><p>which the source of light was hidden. This illumina- </p><p>tion was now necessary, for the diffuse light which </p><p>illuminates a room through its windows, when there </p><p>is a considerable amount of air present, was now </p><p>lacking, only a bright patch of sunlight appearing </p><p>on the forward bulkhead of the cabin, which shed </p><p>a faint light in the cabin! </p><p> I am afraid that the impression we had given our</p><p>first Martian acquaintance was not very favorable, </p><p>for, in the excitement and interest of leaving the </p><p>Earth, we had neglected the elements of courtesy. </p><p>This thought seemed to strike us all about the same </p><p>time, for Hargraves turned and wrote a short sen- </p><p>tence on one of the pads with which we had provided </p><p>ourselves, and handed it to the Martian, who had </p><p>remained seated since he ushered us into this cabin. </p><p>After reading it, he took a small box from his belt </p><p>where it hung, and connected a tube, leading from </p><p>it to the lower part of his helmet. He then spoke </p><p>for a few moments. The voice, though muffled by </p><p>the casing, seemed soft and melodious. After he </p><p>had spoken, he took a sheet of paper-like substance</p><p>from the box, where it had gradually jerked into </p><p>view as he spoke, and handed it to Hargraves. </p><p> “I apologized,” said Hargraves to us, “for our</p><p>rudeness in neglecting our host the way we did, and </p><p>explained that the novelty of the situation was the </p><p>cause. Our friend here understands how we feel </p><p>about it. Ilis note goes on to explain that the cover- </p><p>ing he wears is to protect him from the danger of </p><p>contracting disease, as well as to protect his body </p><p>from the pressure of the air in the space flyer, </p><p>which will be kept at the barometric height we are </p><p>accustomed to. We will be required to wear some- </p><p>what similar suits when we go into other parts of </p><p>this craft. This portion is sealed off and assigned </p><p>to our use; there are two sleeping chambers opposite </p><p>and the cabin is next to this. He will now see </p><p>about storing our food supplies,.if one of us will go </p><p>with him. By the way, this is the commander of </p><p>the craft.” </p><p> My wife and I retired with the skipper after Har-</p><p>graves had “introduced” us. In the next cabin were </p><p>several large receptacles built into the wall and fitted </p><p>with devices to prevent their contents from moving. </p><p>These were the refrigerators which had been prom- </p><p>ised us. They were kept at a low temperature by </p><p>the mixture of chemicals, which absorbed heat on » </p><p>uniting—an endothermic reaction. Arrangements </p><p>were also supplied for heating and cooking, again </p><p>of a chemical nature; this time the admixture which </p><p>gave out heat—an exothermic reaction. Two com- </p><p>mon examples of these reactions are: The heating </p><p>of a mixture of unslaked lime and water, which is </p><p>exothermic, and the cooling of a mixture of sodium </p><p>hyposulphite (the photographers’ “hypo”) and </p><p>water—endothermic. We spent the better part of </p><p>THE RETURN OF THE MARTIANS </p><p>77 </p><p>an hour transferring our food supplies to the food </p><p>chests. Eventually we finished and at once repaired </p><p>to the observation windows of the main cabin. </p><p> Dr. S my the asked the commander for information</p><p>as to our speed and other details. We were now </p><p>some live hundred miles above the Earth's surface </p><p>and, as we could see, over the polar regions. Our </p><p>speed was then about forty miles per second and </p><p>was being gradually accelerated until we reached the </p><p>final velocity of the order of ninety miles per second, </p><p>which velocity would be retained until we got near </p><p>to our destination. Our guide then offered to con- </p><p>duct us through the machine and let us meet the </p><p>other members of the crew, which numbered four. </p><p>On our acceptance of his offer, he showed us where </p><p>our suits were stored, assisted us to don them and </p><p>showed us how to adjust them so that they fitted </p><p>comfortably. </p><p> These suits were much like divers’ suits, which</p><p>likeness was enhanced by the globular helmet which </p><p>surmounted them. Following their adjustment, we </p><p>were shown how to control the air filter and the </p><p>pressure adjustments. We then followed our guide </p><p>forward into a small chamber on the walls of which </p><p>were several dials and indicators. This was an air </p><p>lock, and here the pressure was reduced to that of </p><p>the other compartments. The air was sterilized and </p><p>our suits were sprayed. Truly the Martians were </p><p>taking no chances, nor could we blame them, when </p><p>we remembered the billions of bacilli that were in </p><p>our system or lurked in our clothing. </p><p> After the lapse of a couple of minutes, a second</p><p>door was opened and we entered a large room about </p><p>thirty feet long and the full width of the machine. </p><p>In the center of it a cylinder, about seven feet high </p><p>and five feel in diameter, rose up through an open- </p><p>ing in the floor. From its top led two large pipes, </p><p>one passing forward and the other aft. A gentle </p><p>heat radiated from them. On the forward wall </p><p>of this cabin, on either side of a central door, were </p><p>a number of valves and gauges, or indicators of </p><p>some kind. A second Martian came aft to meet us </p><p>as we entered. He was heavily bandaged about the </p><p>thighs and abdomen, but wore no other clothing or </p><p>ornament. The flesh was brown as though from </p><p>continual exposure to the sun; his head, like that of </p><p>his commander, was crowned with curly chestnut </p><p>hair. He walked with apparent difficulty, to where </p><p>we stood, with a smile of welcome upon his </p><p>features; then, turning to his superior, who was </p><p>relieving himself of his armor, took the automatic </p><p>writer from him and dictated into the mouthpiece</p><p>for a few moments; then held out the sheet. Dr. </p><p>Smythe took it and read aloud for our benefit. It </p><p>contained a word of welcome and an invitation for </p><p>us to avail ourselves of the opportunity of having </p><p>the mechanism of the craft explained. This was </p><p>accepted with alacrity and the second giant then took </p><p>us in charge. </p><p> This compartment, and the one directly below it,</p><p>contained the power plant of the space flyer. The </p><p>central cylinder was the mixing chamber in which </p><p>the chemical fuel of the craft was forced by injec- </p><p>tors. The fuel was in the solid form and was </p><p>pulverized before going to the injectors. On admix- </p><p>ture. it exploded spontaneously and the resulting </p><p>gases were led forward and aft by the two pipes we </p><p>saw. Tl&gt;e pipes divided into four, each branch </p><p>supplying a nozzle outside the hull of the craft. </p><p>These nozzles could be turned and thus the machine </p><p>was guided when in space—the jets of incandescent </p><p>gas propelling the machine as a rocket is propelled </p><p>aloft. The tubes and combustion chamber were cov- </p><p>ered with insulating jackets to prevent undue loss </p><p>of heat—heat being synonymous with energy in a </p><p>heat engine. The pressure in the combustion cham- </p><p>ber was of the order of fifteen hundred atmospheres </p><p>or about twenty-two thousand pounds to the square </p><p>inch; the temperature being 4,200 degrees absolute, </p><p>which by subtraction of 273 gives the Centigrade </p><p>temperature of 3,927 degrees. </p><p> The first Martian now joined us, attired in the</p><p>manner of his companion. This attire was to sup- </p><p>port their inner organs under the greater strain to </p><p>which they were subjected on or near the Earth. We </p><p>were now led through the central door in the bulk- </p><p>head to the foremost compartment—the control </p><p>cabin. Here we saw the third member of the crew, </p><p>of the same fine type as the others, but with slightly </p><p>darker complexion, lie was seated in a comfort- </p><p>able padded chair and his eyes were at the eyepieces </p><p>of what appeared to be the eye-end of a telescope, </p><p>as indeed it proved to be. The rounded, transparent </p><p>nose of the craft gave the pilot a clear view of the </p><p>heavens ahead of him. Above the control cabin, </p><p>we were told, there was the objective of a huge </p><p>refracting telescope. When passing through the </p><p>atmosphere, a streamline hood swung over this. That </p><p>accounts for our not having seen it. The focal </p><p>length of the lens, which was over eight feet in </p><p>diameter, was about one hundred and twenty feet. </p><p>Sixty feet away, over our apartment, was a plane </p><p>mirror which reflected the converging beam back </p><p>again to a point just ahead of the pilot, where an- </p><p>other mirror reflected the beam down to the eye- </p><p>pieces. This huge instrument was necessary in order </p><p>that the pilot might avoid any small bodies in space,</p><p>for, with a velocity of such amounts as those we </p><p>were attaining, it was necessary to see a body at </p><p>least three hundred miles ahead in order to avoid </p><p>it. Bodies too small to be seen with the power used </p><p>were too small to damage the craft. Several times </p><p>during our journey across the gulf we saw brilliant </p><p>flashes of light on the transparent nose-cap, due to </p><p>the impact of small particles of matter. This nose- </p><p>cap was made of one of the toughest and hardest </p><p>substances known to the Martians, so hard that it </p><p>was worked only with the greatest difficulty. Ob- </p><p>jects to be made of it were usually cast into shape, </p><p>to avoid machining. The components of the great </p><p>lens over our heads were made of the same material, </p><p>though of different densities, in order that the lens </p><p>might be achromatic. </p><p> In front of the pilot was a semi-circular dash-</p><p>board, on which the various instruments of naviga- </p><p>tion were mounted. These were pointed out and </p><p>described to us. An air speed indicator, automatic- </p><p>ally corrected for varying densities of the atmos- </p><p>phere through which the machine might fly; pres- </p><p>sure gauges indicating the pressure in the combustion </p><p>chamber and the atmospheric pressure; a flow indi- </p><p>cator that showed the rate at which the propelling </p><p>gases left the nozzles, while other instruments sup- </p><p>plied the other data that were needed by the pilot </p><p>in the operation of his craft, such as total-run meter </p><p>and space-speed indicator. This latter aroused my </p><p>curiosity. How, I asked, could the velocity of the </p><p>machine be measured in space? The method was </p><p>explained to me and the theory of it proved to be </p><p>quite simple. One of two periscope-like arrange- </p><p>78 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>ments projected an image oi the sun upon the slit </p><p>of a spectroscope of very high resolving power. One </p><p>of the sharpest and strongest spectral lines formed </p><p>by the instrument fell upon two line sensitive wires. </p><p>If the line shifted one way or the other, the extra </p><p>heating effect upon one of the wires caused a flow </p><p>of electricity to pass through it, which, by an ar- </p><p>rangement somewhat like the “Wheatstone bridge,” </p><p>automatically recentcred them. The wires were con- </p><p>nected to an indicator. As the space flyer approached </p><p>or receded from the sun, fhe spectral lines shifted </p><p>toward the violet or red respectively—the well- </p><p>known Doppler-Fizeau effect—thus indicating the </p><p>velocity of the machine with respect to the sun. </p><p>Knowing the angle between the path of the machine </p><p>and the line joining the machine and the sun, the </p><p>-true velocity was easily found by an elementary </p><p>trigonometric computation, which was automatically </p><p>performed. </p><p> On returning to our own quarters we were shown</p><p>how to operate the air lock so that we could come </p><p>and go at will. My wife had gone to them some </p><p>time before and, as we entered, we were pleasantly </p><p>surprised to find the swinging table spread witli a </p><p>hearty supper. I suddenly realized that I was </p><p>hungry, and on looking at my watch, was surprised </p><p>to find that it was after eight o’clock, P.S.T. We </p><p>had been on our way for five hours. The Earth </p><p>now appeared as a huge silver crescent with a smaller </p><p>one. the moon, to the right of and beyond it. </p><p> The meal finished, we returned to the pilot cabin</p><p>to find the fourth and last member of the controls </p><p>and the Martian he had relieved talking to him. </p><p>Here we remained, learning more about the strange </p><p>craft and its operation. The air supply, we learned, </p><p>was replenished with oxygen and the carbon dioxide </p><p>removed while the air passed through the filters, </p><p>which it did every five minutes, as this system was </p><p>continually in operation. For landing, the hull of </p><p>the craft was flattened below and stepped like that </p><p>of a hydroplane; it was also equipped with wheels </p><p>that disappeared into recesses in the hull, much like </p><p>our earthly “amphibians.” </p><p> When we retired, a gulf of half-a-million miles</p><p>had widened between us and the earth, which now </p><p>appeared as a crescent twice the size the moon </p><p>presents as seen from the earth. Cynthia herself </p><p>was visible, now but a third of her familiar self, </p><p>beyond and to the right of her big sister. The sun </p><p>appeared to the left—a flaming orb with a single </p><p>scarlet prominence at least a quarter-of-a-million </p><p>miles in height on the western limb.</p><p> To complete a rather sketchy description of this,</p><p>our temporary home, I must mention the arrange- </p><p>ment of the sleeping quarters. The beds, couches </p><p>or berths, which ever you want to call them, were </p><p>slung in a frame in such a manner as to always </p><p>remain horizontal; below them were cupboards, in </p><p>which we could keep our meagre personal effects. </p><p>The machine had been gradually assuming a tilt </p><p>upwards towards the bow, until we now had to use </p><p>the hand-rails, when we moved about the craft. We </p><p>were rapidly losing weight, too; all our movements </p><p>were being made with the greatest ease. </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>THE following day, according to our reckon- </p><p>ing, found us nearly two million miles on our </p><p>way. I was caught unawares on awaking, </p><p>much to my wife’s amusement, for I sat up suddenly </p><p>in bed as is my wont, only to precipitate myself </p><p>from the bed until I came into contact with what </p><p>had been the forward bulkhead, but which now </p><p>appeared to be the ceiling. It took us some little </p><p>time to get used to this new state of affairs, and </p><p>many amusing little incidents took place before we </p><p>became accustomed to the rapidly vanishing effects </p><p>of gravity. </p><p> Day after day went by uneventfully, and during</p><p>this time Hargraves and Smythe set to work to </p><p>master the spoken language of the Martians, which </p><p>proved an easy task to them. My wife and I also </p><p>set ourselves the same task and worked at it steadily </p><p>so that before we arrived at our destination we </p><p>could make ourselves understood. The language of </p><p>the Martians is as logical as a language can be; </p><p>there are no confusing “exceptions” and the verbs </p><p>are as simple to master, as are the written ones that I </p><p>described in my first account. </p><p> We spent most of our time in the control cabin</p><p>as we neared our destination and watched the surface </p><p>features of the ruddy planet unfold as its distance </p><p>decreased. One afternoon I'caught a glimpse of a </p><p>canal like a spider web 011 the planet’s surface, then </p><p>another and another until the surface was seen to </p><p>be covered with an intricate network of them. </p><p> On the day before our arrival, we were startled</p><p>to see brilliant jets of flame shoot ahead of us. They </p><p>were from the retarding nozzles which the pilot had </p><p>opened. Almost at once the bow of the machine be- </p><p>came its floor. For the past few days there had </p><p>been no up or down to us; now, with our negative </p><p>acceleration, the direction in which the craft was </p><p>pointing became our nadir.</p><p> In spite of our suppressed excitement, we slept</p><p>well and awoke on the eleventh day to find the </p><p>planet a huge disk slightly to one side of our path. </p><p>The flow of the jets was increased from time to time </p><p>as we neared our goal. Our pilot was reducing our </p><p>speed and directing the craft so that it would strike </p><p>the upper layers of the atmosphere tangentially with </p><p>the velocity that would carry the machine round the </p><p>planet like another satellite in a circular orbit, if </p><p>all power were cut off. </p><p> As we neared the planet, its features became more</p><p>and more resolved, and I was intensely interested </p><p>in noting the development of details, which I had </p><p>observed from the Earth as only the most vaguely </p><p>defined spots or blurs. </p><p> We struck the outpost of the atmosphere over</p><p>the northern point of the Syrtis Major, the great </p><p>“Hour Glass Sea,” which Huygens had drawn three </p><p>hundred years ago. Eastward we swept, ever near- </p><p>ing the planet’s surface until, when over the region </p><p>we call Elyseum, the Trivium Charontis, a veritable </p><p>junction of canals, appeared on the horizon. </p><p> The Lucus Triviae of the Trivium was our ob-</p><p>jective and over this we glided in a great spiral, </p><p>the “oasis” becoming a tessalated region, centered </p><p>by a vast city beneath our feet. In a couple of </p><p>minutes we were skimming the roofs of that city;, </p><p>then, as a vast pile loomed ahead of us, there was a </p><p>slight jar and the machine was rolling along a </p><p>smooth runway. We had landed on one of the </p><p>galleries of a huge pyramidal building. </p><p> A port below the wings was opened as the machine</p><p>came to rest and the commander of the expedition </p><p>stepped out, beckoning us to follow. There were </p><p>no crowds to meet us—only a single Martian came </p><p>forward from a large doorway as we alighted. We </p><p>THE RETURN OF THE MARTIANS </p><p>79 </p><p>were handed over to this newcomer with the advice </p><p>that we were to go to the official welcome. Led by </p><p>the guide, we entered the doorway into a small </p><p>chamber. On our entrance, he pressed one of a row </p><p>of numbered switches and the chamber glided </p><p>smoothly away. In a moment or two it stopped and </p><p>we stepped out into a large, well-lighted room, whose </p><p>windows looked out on one of the broad galleries </p><p>encircling the building. The diminished sun was </p><p>shining through the windows and in the rays of it </p><p>sat a Martian who appeared to be older than any of </p><p>the few we had met before. He was clad like those </p><p>in the space machine after they had removed their </p><p>supporting bandages after leaving the Earth. </p><p> As we entered, he arose and walked over to greet</p><p>us, welcoming us on behalf of the people of Mars. </p><p>At his request, we seated ourselves on the four chairs </p><p>provided for us, in front of a circular plate of </p><p>some substance that glittered with all the colors </p><p>of the rainbow. This plate was set vertically in a </p><p>panel of arenium and around it were arranged a </p><p>set of reflectors of parabolic form with tiny coils </p><p>of wire in their foci. </p><p> “I am now going to introduce you to the people</p><p>of this planet,” said our host. “This instrument </p><p>transmits both the sound of the voice and an image </p><p>of anything placed before it. In this way all may </p><p>see and hear you. Tell me how you name yourselves </p><p>on the earth.” </p><p> Hargraves “did the honors,” telling the Martian</p><p>our occupations as well as our names, and finished </p><p>by introducing himself. Dr. Smythe added that our </p><p>presence on Mars was due to Hargraves, who dis- </p><p>covered the library. At the conclusion of this cere- </p><p>mony our host pulled out a small knob that pro- </p><p>jected from the panel. The filaments in the reflec- </p><p>tors at once glowed a dull red, and we felt our- </p><p>selves bathed in a gentle heat through our helmets. </p><p>Facing the screen, the Martian spoke. I reproduce </p><p>as much as I can of his speech from Hargraves’ </p><p>account, for I missed most of it, not having been </p><p>well enough advanced in the language to follow </p><p>it well: </p><p> “Citizens of Mars,” he began, “we are able, for</p><p>the first time, to welcome to their parent planet, </p><p>four of the descendants of that ill-fated expedition </p><p>which left to colonize our Evening Star many ages </p><p>ago. You will all join with me, I know, in making </p><p>their stay, which must necessarily be short, as in- </p><p>structive as possible. At the conclusion of their </p><p>visit, let us hope that they will return to their planet,</p><p>which they call the earth, with the seeds of the great </p><p>social system that we developed so long ago. and </p><p>may those seeds fall on fertile ground, so that it </p><p>will not be long before the divers races of the earth </p><p>—for there are many, I am told—will become as </p><p>one. working together for their common welfare </p><p>and advancement. </p><p> “Our guests are: Dr. Smythe—the title ‘Doctor’</p><p>indicating that he has attained a high degree of </p><p>learning in some special department of knowledge, </p><p>in his case Archaeology; (Dr. Smythe had risen </p><p>from his seat in acknowledgement of the introduc- </p><p>tion; we all did in turn.) Dr. Hargraves, another </p><p>archaeolbgist and the discoverer of the records our </p><p>ancestors left behind; Mr. Arnold, an astronomer </p><p>who has made a special study of this world of ours </p><p>and whose instruments so well directed the messages </p><p>we received a short time ago; and lastly, Mrs. </p><p>Arnold, the wife of the astronomer, who has the </p><p>distinction of being the only woman member of the </p><p>expedition. </p><p> “Each of our guests will now speak to you briefly,</p><p>for they have gained some knowledge of our lan- </p><p>guage on their journey here.” </p><p> Our replies were short and to the point, express-</p><p>ing our gratitude to the Martian people for the great </p><p>privilege that had been accorded us and echoing the </p><p>hope that we should see the chaotic conditions </p><p>of our social system give way to, and be replaced </p><p>by. the perfect system that had been so well tried </p><p>and proved on Mars. We acknowledged our great </p><p>inferiority and hoped that they would be patient </p><p>with us and that they would overlook our multitude </p><p>of deficiencies. My wife concluded by presenting </p><p>the planet with the store of books, which we had </p><p>brought with the hope that their perusal would </p><p>elucidate the difficulties which they must have in </p><p>understanding such a complex system, or such com- </p><p>plexity with a lack of system, as existed on the </p><p>Earth. </p><p> At the conclusion of the simple ceremony, our</p><p>host outlined the social system of the Martians to us: </p><p> As soon as the youth of Mars showed their</p><p>natural inclinations, they were trained along those </p><p>lines. On the completion of the training, they were </p><p>appointed to a vacancy that was opened for them, </p><p>there being no more prepared for a line of service </p><p>than it was shown that the branch could absorb. </p><p>Their advancement from this time on was gradual, </p><p>until their period of service ended. The period of </p><p>service varied with the responsibility of the office, </p><p>the shortest being the term of those engaged in</p><p>executive positions; the longer of those engaged in </p><p>tasks which required but little effort. The grading </p><p>of these tasks had been done scientifically, by actual </p><p>measurement of the amount of energy expended in </p><p>performing them. The product of the rate of en- </p><p>ergy expenditure and a time factor, which was </p><p>logarithmic, gave a constant quantity for all positions </p><p>from that of a simple machine operator to that of </p><p>the President. In return for his labor, each member </p><p>of the community was provided with the necessities </p><p>of life, according to the needs of his family. A state </p><p>credit was also given, which allowed him to indulge </p><p>in the luxuries the planet afforded. So highly de- </p><p>veloped were the Martians that they did not need </p><p>supervising; each man knew his duty and it was </p><p>done to the best of his ability; no shirkers were </p><p>present, nor had there been any for many ages. It </p><p>must not be thought that it was fear of punishment </p><p>that kept each man to his task, it was the knowledge </p><p>that he was part of a smoothly working machine </p><p>and that it was only by the co-ordination of the </p><p>whole that he could live and enjoy the benefits the </p><p>system gave him and his millions of companions. </p><p>This wonderful system had developed from the </p><p>necessity arising for the united efforts of the planet </p><p>in the conservation of its water supply, as Lowell </p><p>suspected and pointed out in his “Mars and Its </p><p>Canals." Let me quote him: </p><p> “—Whether increasing common sense or increas-</p><p>ing necessity was the spur that drove the Martians </p><p>to this eminently sagacious state we cannot say, </p><p>but it is certain that reached it they have, and </p><p>equally certain that if they had not they must all </p><p>die. When a planet has attained to the age of </p><p>advancing decrepitude, and the remnant of its water </p><p>supply resides simply in its polar caps, these can </p><p>only be effectively tapped for the benefit of the </p><p>80 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>inhabitants when arctic and equatorial peoples are </p><p>at one. Difference of policy on the question of the </p><p>all-important water supply means nothing short of </p><p>death. Isolated communities cannot there be suffi- </p><p>cient unto themselves; they must combine to solidar- </p><p>ity or perish.” </p><p> The social and economic standing of every mem-</p><p>ber of the community was the same. The birth rate </p><p>of the planet was stabilized in order to keep the </p><p>population well within the limiting number which </p><p>the planet could support, two to three children being </p><p>the number allowed each couple. Love and mar- </p><p>riage, with its subsequent family, was the ideal of </p><p>the race. Before mating, the applicants were sub- </p><p>jected to the most rigorous tests before the union </p><p>of the couple was duly recorded. Seldom, indeed, </p><p>was it necessary for the applicants to be refused this </p><p>privilege and, once made, never was a union dis- </p><p>solved. The tests, which were psychological and </p><p>physical, showed infallibly whether the union would </p><p>be satisfactory or not. Marriage took place at what </p><p>we would consider an early age—as soon as both </p><p>members of the union were mature, which corre- </p><p>sponded to an age of eighteen to twenty. The </p><p>women of Mars were much like the men, save for </p><p>more rounded limbs and slightly shorter stature. The </p><p>women were as active members of the planet’s eco- </p><p>nomic life as were the men; they held the same </p><p>offices and incurred the same responsibilities, the </p><p>only difference being that it was not usual for them </p><p>to assume these positions until their children were </p><p>no longer in need of them, for the early training </p><p>was entrusted to the mothers. The longevity of the </p><p>Martians surpassed that of the Jewish Methuselah, </p><p>an age of fourteen hundred years not being uncom- </p><p>mon. Sickness was unknown to them and death was </p><p>usually artificial, for on feeling the effects of old </p><p>age coming upon them, it was usual to go to one of </p><p>the state institutions where they were painlessly put </p><p>into the long sleep that knows no waking. To some </p><p>of us, this may seem cold-blooded, but on due con- </p><p>sideration. it appears to be the most humane pro- </p><p>cedure; to be a useless member of a community and </p><p>a parasite upon others is not an enjoyable state. </p><p> On the conclusion of this outline, our host, who,</p><p>we learned later, was no less a personage than the </p><p>President of Mars, conducted us to the upper story </p><p>of the vast pile, which formed the “Capitol"' of the </p><p>planet, where the quarters which we were to occupy </p><p>had been prepared for us. These had been sealed </p><p>and supplied with compressors to keep the air at </p><p>our customary atmospheric pressure. Our supplies </p><p>had been removed from the space flyer and carried</p><p>there. We were hungry, so we were left to appease </p><p>our appetites, being directed to call our host when we </p><p>were ready to accompany him to the laboratories, </p><p>where we had been asked to undergo an examina- </p><p>tion by a committee of scientists. Our meal finished, </p><p>Smythe went to the wall, turned an indicator as he </p><p>had been instructed, and informed our host that we </p><p>were ready. Donning our suits, we passed out into </p><p>the gallery through the air-lock, as directed. In a </p><p>few minutes one of the numerous torpedo-shaped </p><p>aircraft that we saw speeding along the air lanes </p><p>swooped down and settled on the gallery. Our host, </p><p>who was seated at the controls, invited us to enter. * </p><p>Briefly, the machine was described to us before we </p><p>left. Under the floor we were shown several cylin- </p><p>ders. about a foot long and four inches in diameter, </p><p>to these w'ere connected heavy wires which led to </p><p>the driving and lifting mechanism. The latter con- </p><p>tained many heavy coils of wire, in a case supported </p><p>on two rails that were rigidly attached to the frame- </p><p>work of the machine over our heads. The source of </p><p>power was likened to electricity, but must not be </p><p>confused with that. On flowing through the coils, </p><p>a repulsive action was developed which drove the </p><p>machine upwards. Sliding on the two rails, the con- </p><p>tainer so adjusted itself that the center of gravity </p><p>of the machine was directly below it, thus accom- </p><p>modating itself for varytffg distribution of the loads </p><p>the machine carried. A similar arrangement in the </p><p>stern served to propel the craft; this was mounted </p><p>on a pivot which allowed the horizontal direction </p><p>of the driving thrust to be varied by the pilot in </p><p>order to steer the machine, while a second set of </p><p>coils in the bow served to retard and stop the car. </p><p>The power carried in the cylinders was enough to </p><p>drive the machine at a speed of nine hundred miles </p><p>per hour for thirty hours. </p><p> At my request, Hargraves inquired if the Mar-</p><p>tians had not discovered how to transmit power by </p><p>wireless. They had, long ago, was the answer, but </p><p>its efficiency never reached a very high standard, so </p><p>it had been abandoned, as everything inefficient was </p><p>abandoned, as soon as they discovered the source </p><p>of power they now used, which was practically one </p><p>hundred per cent efficient, compared with but six </p><p>per cent of the former. </p><p> We rose from the gallery as the operator turned</p><p>a dial, and then shot forward in a westerly direc- </p><p>tion, about half a mile above the city which shone </p><p>with wonderful beauty as the afternoon sun brought </p><p>out the bold but beautiful color schemes of the </p><p>architecture. Continuing his description of the flyer </p><p>and its operation, our pilot informed us that the </p><p>ceiling of the machine was limited—above seven </p><p>miles the repulsive force was not enough to support</p><p>it—that was the reason another type had been devel- </p><p>oped for interplanetary work. </p><p> In a very short time we arrived at our destina-</p><p>tion, covering the twenty-odd miles that separated </p><p>the two buildings in four or five minutes. Alighting </p><p>on one of the ever-present galleries, we were con- </p><p>ducted to a chamber in which eight Martians awaited </p><p>us. I was the first “victim” and was led to an </p><p>antechamber, in the center of which was a small </p><p>circular platform. I was directed to stand on this </p><p>platform, facing a tall white screen. Behind me and </p><p>to either side of me were circular batteries of lenses, </p><p>above and below which were arranged long narrow </p><p>tubes of a transparent medium in front of highly </p><p>polished reflectors of some greenish material. On a </p><p>table to the right of the screen were numerous in- </p><p>struments whose use I could not begin to guess, </p><p>and a piece of apparatus I did recognize—a simple </p><p>conical pendulum. </p><p> Directing me to remain motionless, one of the</p><p>committee took his stand at the table, while the </p><p>others crowded around the screen. 1 was suddenly </p><p>bathed in a greenish glow and on the screen before </p><p>me there appeared an image of my figure as seen </p><p>from the front. Suddenly, the chest o'f my protect- </p><p>ing suit seemed to be sliced away in the figure, then </p><p>the flesh appeared, just as though a vertical slice </p><p>had been made through my clothing. Gradually, the </p><p>section plane cut deeper and deeper into my body </p><p>until the lungs, heart and stomach were shown in </p><p>section. It was a weird feeling to see oneself por- </p><p>trayed thus, and it was all I could do to remain </p><p>THE RETURN OF THE MARTIANS </p><p>81 </p><p>motionless. I could feel nothing, no more than </p><p>one feels the “X-ray,” of which this was evidently </p><p>a glorified example. In a few minutes the plane </p><p>had passed completely through me, exposing every </p><p>fiber and nerve of my body in its progress to the </p><p>scrutiny of the watchers. At the end I was asked </p><p>to step down and the operator went to the rear of </p><p>the screen, reappearing with a number of sheets on </p><p>which I caught a glimpse of my figure as it had </p><p>appeared on the screen. For a few moments some </p><p>of these, which had been singled out by the group, </p><p>were subjected to a careful scrutiny and discussion, </p><p>then one of them turned to me and asked if I would </p><p>like to have corrected the various parts of my body </p><p>which were not functioning properly. I finally un- </p><p>derstood his suggestion after several repetitions. </p><p>On ascertaining that it would not take very long, I </p><p>assented and was then put into the hands of two </p><p>others who entered at some signal. The sheets were </p><p>given them and, after a brief discussion of my case, </p><p>I was led away into an adjoining room. Here I was </p><p>laid on a long white table, whose surface was cov- </p><p>ered with some soft smooth material and a metal </p><p>clamp was attached to each ankle and wrist. All </p><p>at once there seemed to be a snap in my brain and </p><p>my consciousness reeled for a moment—at least so </p><p>it seemed—the bands were removed and I was di- </p><p>rected to arise. As I did so, I was astonished to </p><p>find that my leg, which had troubled me ever since </p><p>I was unfortunate enough to run foul of a “five- </p><p>nine” at Vimy Ridge, was as well as the other, and </p><p>at the same time I realized that my glasses had been </p><p>removed and that I could see far better than I ever </p><p>could see with them. I was conducted back to </p><p>where Smythe and my wife were waiting. </p><p> “I thought you were never coming,” said my</p><p>wife. “What have they been doing with you?” </p><p>I	told her, adding that I had not been gone for more</p><p>than ten minutes. </p><p> “Ten minutes! Look at your watch!” she re-</p><p>torted. T looked at my wrist watch, which I had </p><p>strapped outside the suit I wore. I had been gone </p><p>nearly an hour and a half! That night, in our </p><p>own apartments, I found several marks that looked </p><p>like old scratches on my body. Yet I had never felt </p><p>the slightest sensation of the operations that had </p><p>been performed on me. But from that time on, </p><p>several distressing symptoms that I had had for </p><p>some time before, never bothered me again. What </p><p>surgery! T had been stripped, operated upon in no </p><p>less than six places and dressed, all in the short </p><p>time that I had been on the table.</p><p> After a few minutes Hargraves appeared and</p><p>was equally surprised to find how long he had been </p><p>under that wonderful anesthetic. He, too, had “un- </p><p>dergone repairs,” as he called it. </p><p> We now returned to the flyer, to find that it was</p><p>under the control of another pilot, the President </p><p>having had an important call during our visit to </p><p>the laboratories. Our new pilot was one of the many </p><p>who had volunteered to instruct and entertain us dur- </p><p>ing our visit. We were more than an hour in re- </p><p>turning. for our guide took us all over the city, </p><p>explaining and pointing things out to us. On the </p><p>morrow, he promised us, he would show us some- </p><p>thing of the great Martian irrigation system; he, </p><p>having been a high official in the engineering depart- </p><p>ment. was assigned as our instructor in that subject. </p><p> That evening we watched the sunset from our</p><p>aerie and watched the rising of Phobos, the inner </p><p>moon of Mars. To an observer from the earth, the </p><p>moons of Mars present surprising sights, for, poets </p><p>and non-scientific authors to the contrary, no heav- </p><p>enly bodies rise in the west to the inhabitants of </p><p>the earth. Yet here on Mars we watched the rising </p><p>of Phobos in the west, for, moving around its pri- </p><p>mary as it does, in about 7h. 39m., it moves faster </p><p>around the planet than the planet turns on its axis. </p><p>Rising in the west, it remains above the horizon </p><p>for about five and one-half hours; setting in the east </p><p>to reappear in a like interval in the west, running </p><p>through all its phases in eleven hours. Deimos, the </p><p>outer moon, was overhead at sundown. Here is an- </p><p>other strange sight. The period of Deimos is 30h. </p><p>18m., hence he rises in the east, but remains above </p><p>the horizon for over two days. Phobos, the larger </p><p>of the two moons, appears to have but one-fifth of </p><p>the diameter of the moon as seen from the earth, </p><p>while Deimos appears to be but one-twentieth. </p><p> While we sat there watching the shades of eve-</p><p>ning sweep over the city, there came an alarm from </p><p>the annunciator and we heard the President’s voice </p><p>asking to see us. He entered through the air-lock </p><p>a minute later and seated himself at the window </p><p>where we were grouped. He said: </p><p> “I was called away this afternoon to witness a</p><p>new discovery that has just been made. Discoveries </p><p>are now few and far between with us, and this latest </p><p>has been stimulated by the news of your intended </p><p>visit some weeks ago. It is a medical discovery and </p><p>the result of it is that we will now be able to visit </p><p>your earth with impunity. The discoverer has found </p><p>that we can strengthen our bodies so that they will </p><p>be able to withstand many times the pull of gravi-</p><p>tation to which they are subjected here; moreover </p><p>the drug so increases the resisting power of the </p><p>body that no disease will affect it, as has been shown </p><p>by a subject who volunteered to try it on himself. </p><p>He has been proved to be immune from the most </p><p>virulent germs, cultures of which were injected into </p><p>him long enough ago to show definitely if they af- </p><p>fected him or not. We have decided to accompany </p><p>you back to the earth to assist you in your task of </p><p>developing a system similar to ours, modified where </p><p>necessary to conform to your special requirements. </p><p> “A report from your examiners this afternoon</p><p>tells me that you are not adapted to use the chemical </p><p>foods that we use. As perhaps you have noticed, </p><p>we eat no foods such as you consume; all our nour- </p><p>ishment is taken in the concentrated form, in which </p><p>there is no waste matter. This is one of the main </p><p>reasons for our longevity. You will have to make </p><p>the change gradually. </p><p> “From now until the end of your stay, you will be</p><p>shown all that we can show you of this planet, and </p><p>ample facilities will be given you for each to study </p><p>that part which interests him most. On your return, </p><p>you will be accompanied by four other machines— </p><p>the vanguard of our second invasion.” </p><p> The President smiled that friendly smile, typical</p><p>of all the Martians, as lie concluded. I wondered, </p><p>as I gazed out over the city, which was now lit as </p><p>brightly as day, how long it would be before we </p><p>would become as truly great as the Martians had </p><p>become, how long it would be before we would all </p><p>be able to treat creatures which were as inferior to </p><p>us as we must be to the Martians with such kindness </p><p>and with an apparent lack of condescension and no </p><p>exhibition of superiority; truly the Martians were </p><p>great and more than worthy of emulation. </p><p>82 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>THE following day, we were conducted on the </p><p>promised tour of inspection of the “canals.” </p><p>We had arisen early to see the Morning Star of </p><p>Mars, a brilliant, silvery white point of light in the </p><p>eastern sky, accompanied by a fainter one close to </p><p>it. It was hard to realize that this was our home </p><p>—over seventy million miles away. Our pilot of </p><p>the preceding afternoon arrived soon after we had </p><p>finished breakfast and we were whisked away at </p><p>once, heading towards the northern polar cap.* Fol- </p><p>lowing the great circle course of the Dis, a broad </p><p>belt of cultivated territory running due north and </p><p>south, which is one of the seven larger “canals” </p><p>which spread fanwise northward from the Trivium, </p><p>we sped north at the highest speed the machine could </p><p>attain. Three hours' flight brought us to the edge </p><p>of the fast melting cap and from aloft we could see </p><p>the whole countryside inundated with water as far </p><p>as the eye could reach. We descended to within a </p><p>few feet of its surface and our guide pointed out </p><p>the lateral and main ditches, which were fast carry- </p><p>ing the precious fluid to the great underground stor- </p><p>age basins. Moving further north, we came to the </p><p>snow cap itself and here the machine settled while </p><p>we got out and stretched our legs. It was mere </p><p>slush, and streams of water had in many places </p><p>washed the snow away, revealing the cap to be quite </p><p>thin. We were informed that the maximum amount </p><p>of snow that fell was fifteen feet, while the average </p><p>was about ten. We returned to our machine and </p><p>were then taken eastward to where a great rift </p><p>showed in the cap. This was the line of one of the </p><p>canals and fresh vegetation was already springing </p><p>up under the rays of the early summer sun. Now, </p><p>turning the machine’s nose southward, we proceeded </p><p>towards the Utopia region and towards the “Wedge </p><p>of Casius,” the latter a great angular marking on the </p><p>maps of the planet. </p><p> Here we found a vast area under intensive cul-</p><p>tivation : huge machines plowing, fertilizing and seed- </p><p>ing the ground. On request, our pilot dropped down </p><p>until our machine rested on the top of a gigantic </p><p>cultivator below. We alighted and were conducted </p><p>into the interior. The whole structure was vibrant </p><p>with hidden power as it moved forward at a speed </p><p>of perhaps ten miles per hour. We were shown </p><p>into the control room, where the operator sat. Of </p><p>course we were at once recognized and. leaving his </p><p>seat, he greeted us, then conducted us below, where </p><p>he explained the operation of the machine. He would </p><p>leave it to guide itself for hours. The body of the </p><p>machine was suspended about two feet above the</p><p>level ground on endless caterpillar treads. The soil </p><p>was taken in forward by means of rotary scoops </p><p>after it had been loosened by the ploughshares; </p><p>it was then carried to “digestors,” which pulverized </p><p>and prepared it. Samples of the soil taken from </p><p>four points of the machine’s seventy foot width </p><p>were carried to mechanical analyzers which con- </p><p>tinuously determined the quantity and kind of fer- </p><p>tilizer required lo bring it up to perfection for the </p><p>crops raised here, from which were obtained one of </p><p>the most important elements of their food supply. </p><p>The analyzers then automatically regulated the sup- </p><p>ply of the different fertilizers which were supplied </p><p>to the “digestors.” </p><p> On leaving the machine, the soil was spread in</p><p>the broad furrow from which it had been taken and </p><p>the process was completed by seeding and rolling. </p><p> The work was carried on day and night at the rate</p><p>of over three square miles a day for each machine, </p><p>thousands of machines being engaged in the task. </p><p> Leaving the cultivator, we headed towards the</p><p>Trivium once more, following a new “canal,” the </p><p>Eunostos, from the point where it leaves the wedge </p><p>at the Aquae Calidae, for several hundred miles, </p><p>crossing Elysium and arriving “home” as the sun </p><p>was setting, tired and hungry, for we had eaten </p><p>nothing since breakfast. </p><p> The land is cultivated for widths from a few hun-</p><p>dred yards to ten miles on either side of the great </p><p>arteries of the planet, depending upon the size of </p><p>the subterranean aqueduct. In the case of the </p><p>larger arteries, lateral pipelines convey the precious </p><p>fluid to the area under cultivation and the growth </p><p>that follows makes their course visible to the trained </p><p>eye at the other end of a good instrument under </p><p>the best observing conditions on the earth. </p><p> The next day we were shown the great under-</p><p>ground storage basins, hundreds of square miles iii </p><p>extent, where the precious fluid was sealed to pre- </p><p>vent loss by evaporation. With each of these vast </p><p>reservoirs were associated the pumping machinery </p><p>of the system. We stood in awe under the shadow </p><p>of the gigantic machines which would dwarf any </p><p>earthly construction into insignificance, watching the </p><p>whirling metal shafts and the glittering piston rods </p><p>as they rose and fell, thudding out the heart beats </p><p>of the planet which sent its life blood coursing </p><p>through its artfiicial veins. </p><p> Day after day, during our twenty-seven day stay</p><p>on the planet, we were kept busily employed. I, </p><p>of course, took the greatest interest in the astro-</p><p>nomical work of the planet and, with a machine that </p><p>was placed at my disposal, I visited the principal </p><p>observatories of that world. How tiny even our </p><p>huge reflectors were, compared with the instruments </p><p>I	saw there. Imagine how I felt when I took my</p><p>place at the eyepiece of the giant of the giant re- </p><p>flectors, with a mirror more than seven hundred </p><p>feet across, more than seven thousand times the </p><p>light-grasping power of the great Mt. Wilson re- </p><p>flector. With the thin Martian air and its excep- </p><p>tional clarity and steadiness, it was possible to make </p><p>observations with undreamed of powers, powers so </p><p>great that for the first time I saw stars as disks, tiny </p><p>disks, it is true, but nevertheless, disks large enough </p><p>in some cases to see their photospheric disturbances. </p><p>It is impossible for us on the earth to see any star, </p><p>other than the sun, as a disk, due to the nature of </p><p>light, until the diameters, and hcnce the “resolving </p><p>power,” of our instruments are greatly increased. </p><p> As the time for our departure drew near, a deep</p><p>regret was felt by all of us, so much had the inward </p><p>beauty of the Martians taken hold of us, and we </p><p>fell that we were leaving a paradise. The one con- </p><p>soling thought was, that we were not returning alone, </p><p>but with friends who, we felt sure, would soon be </p><p>able to organize our woefully muddled world into a </p><p>world that would begin to approach the ideal we </p><p>had witnessed. </p><p> There seems no need for me to go into the details</p><p>of our return voyage or the surprise of the world </p><p>by the return of the Martians. The press has blazed </p><p>with headlines, capping articles that in many cases </p><p>contained not a grain of truth, and it has only been </p><p>with difficulty that the little community we have </p><p>built up has been kept aloof from foolish egotists, </p><p>THE RETURN OF THE MARTIANS </p><p>83 </p><p>who think they can match their minute brains against </p><p>the magnificent knowledge of the Martians. We </p><p>have had to lay down an impregnable barrier de- </p><p>vised by our friends around our camp in order that </p><p>we might nut be disturbed while the builders of the </p><p>new world are studying our planet at every angle, </p><p>preparatory to launching their campaign. Let the </p><p>world rest assured; there will be no sudden upheaval, </p><p>but a gradual change in which the whole of human- </p><p>ity will benefit in a way the idealists have never </p><p>dreamed of. Even some of my friends, economists </p><p>and idealists, who thought that they had developed </p><p>the ideal system, stand in awe of the millenium that </p><p>looms before them. </p><p>THE END. </p><p> In this department wc shall discuss, every month, topics of interest to readers.

Amazing Stories: </p><p> I just wish to continent upon a few of the</p><p>more recent stories of your worthy publication. </p><p> "The Machine Man of Ardathia" is, in my esti-</p><p>mation, a marvelous scientifiction story. Mr. </p><p>Koblischkc in the January issue claims that it is </p><p>ridiculous; that human beings should ever evolute </p><p>into sexless automatons is biologically improb- </p><p>able, he thinks. The story states to the effect </p><p>that the Bi-chanifs and the, Tri-namics nropa- </p><p>gated their species by fertilizing the female </p><p>ovum in ecto-genetic incubators till it was past </p><p>the embryonic stage of development. The young </p><p>Bi-chanic or Tri-namic was then encased m a </p><p>transparent cylinder. Finally, this led to the </p><p>extinction of the female sex because it was no </p><p>longer necessary, then the whole race began to </p><p>die off. “The Machine Man of Ardathia” created </p><p>synthetically the equivalent of the female ovum, </p><p>and in ecto-genetic incubators developed it; the </p><p>body after passing the embryonic stage was </p><p>placed in a transparent cylinder, as had done </p><p>the Bi chanics and Tri-namics before them, but </p><p>it was also supplied with tubes furnishing it the </p><p>necessary energy for rebuilding its body tissues, </p><p>which was only a minor affair .due to the small </p><p>amount of muscular activity carried on by the</p><p>Ardathian. Now. you see. sex was no longer </p><p>essential. An automaton defined is a machine </p><p>controlled by some external agency having no </p><p>volition or cognizance of its own. The Ardathians </p><p>had both these attributes, wherefore call them </p><p>automatons! They still thought and reasoned </p><p>somewhat as humans do. They were not human, </p><p>they were superhuman. </p><p> The Ardathian was probably above most emo-</p><p>tions, as wc know them. Emotions didn’t come </p><p>from the reaction of their viscera, as it does in </p><p>our case. They were above . emotion, as we </p><p>know it. for this reason: emotions arc traits of </p><p>mammalia which have been developed through </p><p>ages of maternal protection. The extinction of </p><p>sex among the Ardathians withdrew the maternal </p><p>instinct and its influences eventually died out. </p><p> Now, I don’t see why this story should be</p><p>regarded as fantastic or inconceivable. With </p><p>man’s present tendency to rely upon machines to </p><p>do his work and even his thinking in some </p><p>eases, the gap between the human being and </p><p>machine is rapidly lessening in width, lliis is </p><p>a great speculative field. The morbid vein in </p><p>which the story runs is altogether fitting for the </p><p>circumstances. This story should set some of </p><p>your readers thinking of the possibilities of truth </p><p>that are evidenced in body. </p><p> "The Face in the Abyss." bv Merritt, in your</p><p>Annual, certainly was splendid. The weaving of </p><p>legendary lore and tradition into the* text of the </p><p>storv improves it. The description of the 'face, </p><p>of "Yu-Atlanchi,” of the “Snake Woman," and </p><p>of the arts of the inhabitants of “Yu-Atlanchi.' </p><p>was remarkable. The science is altogether origi- </p><p>nal in this story. </p><p> "The Metal Emperor," now running in Science</p><p>and Invention, is as weird and fascinating a </p><p>storv as T have ever read. Fancy metal given </p><p>volition and cognizance; it isn’t possible. The </p><p>probability of extrosenses is also a strong one- </p><p>senses that even the Oriental Occultists are un- </p><p>aware of. The story, "Below the Infra-lied." </p><p>was interesting. It contained a full measure of </p><p>good, plausible science, but it is altogether too </p><p>idealistic and the ending too incongruous. Hyp- </p><p>notism is not known to ensue without the aid </p><p>and co-operation of the recipient; with the hyp- </p><p>notist lure, however, the wills were developed </p><p>so highly that a strong will could overcome a </p><p>wcakcr_antagonistic will. </p><p> "The Camel Doom" certainly provided me with</p><p>enough thrills and food for speculative thought.</p><p>Description of the moment when the earth’s fate </p><p>was in balance with the odds altogether against </p><p>its coming out victorious was a true touch of </p><p>mastery by the author when he proposed a last- </p><p>minute’ rescue.	L. Cordelias,</p><p>Bradley Beach, N. J. </p><p> [There’s a note of sadness in the story about</p><p>"The Machine Man of Ardathia," which you put </p><p>very well in your text. We will agree that man </p><p>and" machine are approaching one another. Some- </p><p>times we think that the approach is very close </p><p>in such establishments as automobile factories. </p><p>In automatic machinery, there is so much quasi- </p><p>intelligence, that an automatic man would be a </p><p>possible concept of the future. Certainly, a man </p><p>who spends day after day and year after year </p><p>in putting a minor part on an automobile, that </p><p>passes slowly by him on a platform, is to all </p><p>intents and purposes, a machine man as long as </p><p>In- is thus engaged. </p><p> But do not imagine that our authors restrict</p><p>their narratives to absolute possibilities, or </p><p>rather, probabilities within the range of our </p><p>judgment and experience. We do not know what </p><p>the future will bring forth and the world seems </p><p>ready for any new surprise that may come along. </p><p>We certainly have had enough wonders to sur- </p><p>prise anybody, even in the last five years.— </p><p>EDITOR.] </p><p>BRICKBATS GALORE-OUR COVER ILLUS- </p><p>TRATIONS THE TARGET </p><p> In looking over “Discussions.” I find that other</p><p>people have covered my likes and dislikes rather </p><p>thoroughly, except for one small item; not a large </p><p>one. and one that may not interest the majority </p><p>of readers. It is this: Your Amazing Magazine </p><p>cover. Outlandish! </p><p> Can you imagine a staid business man, middle-</p><p>aged, with a leaning toward the glamour of sci- </p><p>ence. furtively going up to the newsstand, look- </p><p>ing over the magazines till no one is watching, </p><p>then quickly snatching a copy of Amazing </p><p>Stories, tuck it under his coat, pay the girl and </p><p>slink away with dread, lest some business ac- </p><p>quaintance might sec him and think he is reading </p><p>“Nick Carter, and thereby doubt his business </p><p>sagacity? Well, my dear editor, that is just my </p><p>predicament. Do you wonder that I am becom- </p><p>ing a nervous wreck? I do not know where you </p><p>procurc the paper that you put into the magazine, </p><p>nor the terrible colors and illustrations on the </p><p>outside, but frankly, they arc both quite passe,</p><p>don’t you know? Sincerely, </p><p> R. F. DeBritt.</p><p>.	(Address not given.)</p><p> [We claim that we publish unfavorable as well</p><p>as favorable criticisms, and wc think that this </p><p>letter, attacking the cover illustrations, proves </p><p>our claim first stated. There’s so mueh in the </p><p>illustrations, and the blend of personality and </p><p>science is so well carried out in them, that wc </p><p>can perfectly well imagine a staid business man </p><p>buying a copy without being furtive in any way </p><p>and without being ashamed of himself. So, if </p><p>the writer is really picturing himself as a pur- </p><p>chaser. let him think it over and see whether he </p><p>is not needlessly disturbed. If he will study </p><p>the cover illustrations attentively, he will see </p><p>that sometimes they arc very remarkable pro- </p><p>ductions in the line of mcchanical detail. The </p><p>artist. Paul, who does many of them, has a very </p><p>special ability in the line of producing this class </p><p>of work, which most artists would find difficult </p><p>or impossible. Then. too. Mr. DeBritt might sub- </p><p>scribe to the magazine. H comes fully wrapped </p><p>that way!—EDITOR.] </p><p>TRAVELING INTO THE FUTURE, AND </p><p>TIME TRAVELING </p><p>Editor. Amazing Stories: </p><p>I have just been re-reading the Discussion Col- </p><p>umns in the December issue of your magazine </p><p>and I notice in it a letter from I. M. Lichtigman </p><p>of Brooklyn. In it lie speaks at length on the </p><p>fourth Dimension and brings in an excellent </p><p>theory about duration of light waves. But does </p><p>he know why time is considered the Fourth Di- </p><p>mension? If not, I suggest that lie take a pencil </p><p>and draws a line with it on a sheet of paper. </p><p>Now, if that line is to exist at all it must have </p><p>length, breadth and time, for, without this, it </p><p>could not have been drawn. </p><p>As it is possible to travel in the three dimen- </p><p>sions that we know of, is there any plausible </p><p>reason why wc should not be able to travel in </p><p>nine? .Mr. Lichtigman speaks of a theory of </p><p>Duration of I.iglil Waves, but this may have </p><p>nothing whatever to do with it. The idea about </p><p>time is that, once you have done something, it </p><p>stays forever in a plane in time. This plane can </p><p>be traveled in just as any other plane. </p><p>As for the writer’s few words on traveling into </p><p>the future they carry no weight at all. lie says</p><p>that, if nothing exists its picture cannot be made. </p><p>Quite so. but how does he know that things in </p><p>the future do not already exist? When a blind </p><p>mail looks into a mirror he docs not see his </p><p>image, nor can he feel, hear, or smell it. There- </p><p>fore, I suppose, it docs not exist. This is all </p><p>his reasoning comes to. </p><p>My theory on Time-traveling is, that if you </p><p>can Tiinc-travel, you are invisible and have no </p><p>influence. What would happen if you had? Take </p><p>one example. Suppose that 30 years ago, when a </p><p>voting man, you had been the owner of a large </p><p>house and you were debating as to whether you </p><p>should add ail extension to your house or not. </p><p>You wrote a letter to the builders but threw it </p><p>away, thinking better of your idea. Then you </p><p>went to the Continent for a year. </p><p>Now, if you can travel through Time and have </p><p>influence in the past, you coulago into the house </p><p>in safety and re write the letter, and send it to </p><p>the builders. The extension is then built. </p><p>In the present time, then, a building will sud- </p><p>denly arise out of the ground. But this is obvi- </p><p>ously ridiculous. </p><p>Concerning the illustrations: Paul may be a </p><p>good artist, but f am very glad that people do </p><p>not have faces like those of some of the people </p><p>in his pictures. They are just as bad in The </p><p>Metal Emperor in Science and Invention. More </p><p>illustrations, by all means, but less of these faces. </p><p>One word in conclusion, do not make Amazing </p><p>Stories semi-monthly. It would be too much of </p><p>a good thing. </p><p>Also let us have another Cover Contest. </p><p>Wishing Amazing Stories a long and prosper- </p><p>ous life.	Malcolm E. Humphcry,</p><p>Norfolk, England. </p><p>[Referring to the last clause of your letter </p><p>first, you will find that there is anothej cover </p><p>contest, this time, of 3 very original kind, and </p><p>one which we think will excite considerable in- </p><p>terest and elicit material perhaps even better </p><p>than or as good as we secured by our last one. </p><p>The cover contests arc absolutely for the benefit </p><p>of our readers, to give them fresh literature to </p><p>read, and to open the gate for new authors to try </p><p>their hand at writing scientific fiction and to </p><p>bring out new ideas artistic and scientific. </p><p>Of course, traveling through time is quite the-</p><p>oretical and it is. as far as we now know, quite </p><p>impossible, but the beauty of the subject is that </p><p>it brings up an interesting quantity of discus- </p><p>sions; opens up an attractive field of suggestion, </p><p>and certainly makes people think. Your interest- </p><p>ing letter is due precisely to such causes.— </p><p>EDITOR.] </p><p>(Continued on pane 86) </p><p>84 Baron Miinchhausen’s Scientific Adventures </p><p>By HUGO GERNSBACK </p><p>(Continued from page 47) </p><p>dieted the existence of a new planet, Neptune, which </p><p>no one had ever seen before.* </p><p> "The Martian that I was gaping at, who was</p><p>standing nearest to me, was between eight and nine </p><p>feet tall, a veritable giant. He had an immense head </p><p>with a straight forehead, at least seven inches high. </p><p>His light blue eyes were about two inches in diameter </p><p>and placed close together; moreover, they had a </p><p>marvelously intelligent, as well as keen look in them, </p><p>impossible to describe. Their hypnotic gaze held </p><p>one spellbound and seemed to go clear through you. </p><p> “The long thin nose was enormous, but harmon-</p><p>ized well with the rest of the face; the complexion </p><p>was somewhat brown. The large ears stood out </p><p>straight and looked like enormous oyster shells, with </p><p>the inside turned towards me. I fowever, what caught </p><p>my eye particularly was the strange ‘caps' all Mar- </p><p>tians wore. These caps looked as i f they were made </p><p>of a flexible metal. From their back dangled what </p><p>1	thought to be a flexible metal wire. We were</p><p>soon to know their purpose. </p><p> “The chest, or rather the torso of the Martians,</p><p>was simply out of all proportion to the rest of the </p><p>body. It was enormous, and made him look strangely </p><p>top-heavy. His arms appeared thin and emaciated, </p><p>as did his legs. His hands had each two thumbs </p><p>and four fingers, the extra thumb being between the </p><p>thumb and index finger, as compared to the human </p><p>hand. The hand itself was very small; in fact, it </p><p>looked much like an Earth woman’s hand. </p><p> “The feet were almost circular in shape and meas-</p><p>ured at least 18 inches in diameter. The base looked </p><p>very much like an elephant's foot, although the ankle </p><p>was rather small and graceful, as compared to the big </p><p>flat foot. The outside of the Martian’s dress glis- </p><p>tened strangely in the sunlight, and I felt sure that </p><p>it must be made of a flexible metal, unknown to us. </p><p>It fitted rather loosely and did not appear to have </p><p>much style. The upper part of the body was en- </p><p>closed in a sort of blouse, such as our young boys </p><p>wear on Earth. The trousers looked like knickers, </p><p>except that they extended down to the ankles. </p><p> “While we were still gazing enraptured at these</p><p>strange, marvelous beings, we suddenly became con- </p><p>scious that our brains were being filled with a won- </p><p>derful sort of music which seemed to originate inside </p><p>our heads. Instantly, the Martians who had stood</p><p>around in a haphazard manner, formed a lane, the </p><p>center of which was formed by ourselves. At the </p><p>one end we now perceived a colossal, bewildering </p><p>structure with a church-like appearance, which </p><p>seemed to turn around slowly on its axis. When its </p><p>ponderous portals, measuring at least 200 feet in </p><p>height, had swung around so that they pointed in our </p><p>direction, the structure ceased revolving. Immedi- </p><p>ately the portals slid back and out stepped a dis- </p><p>tinguished looking Martian, taller even than his </p><p>brothers. He was dressed like them, except that </p><p>his metallic cap appeared yellow in color. </p><p> “At a gesture, two Martians stepped toward us</p><p>and, taking oft our headgear, replaced them with the </p><p>soft metallic caps. By this time the distinguished </p><p>looking Martian had come up close to us and stood </p><p>still, only five feet away. He next placed the tips </p><p>of the fingers of both hands to his temples, which </p><p>we took to be a salute. We hastened to respond </p><p>likewise, but we must have executed the motion </p><p>poorly, for a faint, rather amused smile flitted over </p><p>the brownish features of the august Martian. Then </p><p>he turned around and some attendants bade us with </p><p>a motion to follow the chief, which we did. He </p><p>then entered the church-like structure and we fol- </p><p>lowed him deferentially. </p><p> “Well, Alier, my boy, I guess the telegraphone</p><p>wire must be almost full by this time. So i guess I </p><p>will have to close for today. Now don’t forget to </p><p>listen in tomorrow night, for there’s a lot to be said </p><p>about this wonderful planet. Good-night . . </p><p> A low, rhythmic hum for a few seconds, then</p><p>click, click-click-click, click, a snapping sound and </p><p>the ether between the Moon and old mother Earth </p><p>was undisturbed once more. </p><p> ♦Jean Joseph Lcvcrricr, a French astronomer, on August</p><p>31, 1846, in a paper to the licole Poly technique, declared that </p><p>he had computed the orbit of a supposed new planet still </p><p>further removed than Uranius, which was then thought to </p><p>be the last planet in the solar system. Not only did Lcverrier </p><p>predict the new planet, but he predicted it to be a star of the </p><p>eighth magnitude. Most wonderful of all, however, he </p><p>actually indicated where this new planet should be located </p><p>in the heavens, and he asked that astronomers should look </p><p>for it there. This, Galle, of the Berlin Observatory, did on </p><p>September 23, of the same year, and he found the new planet </p><p>within less than 1° from the spot indicated by Levcrrier, who </p><p>had never seen the planet himself. Lcverrier had based his </p><p>scientific prophecy upon certain observed irregularities of the </p><p>planet Uranius. although Neptune is 2.654.560.000 miles away </p><p>from the earth—an enormous distance. </p><p> (To be continued next month)</p><p> WANTED</p><p>The publishers need a quantity of back numbers of AMAZING STORIES </p><p>for September and October, 1927. </p><p>ilf yon have copies of these issues, please communicate with the circula- </p><p>tion department.

NT</p><p>MUENCHHADSEN’S RETURN WELCOMED. </p><p>SOME INTERESTING CRITICISMS OF </p><p>WRITERS AND ARTISTS </p><p> Editor. Amazing Stories:</p><p> I first made the acquaintance of one I. M.</p><p> Alier in the Electrical Experimenter, and hail his</p><p> return in Amazing Stories with (tic pleasure</p><p> one feels on meeting an old friend after years of</p><p> separation. I was a constant reader of the above-</p><p> mentioned the magazine and carried on when it</p><p> liecame Scicnec and Invention. When the con-</p><p> test to name Amazing Stories was announced, I</p><p> looked forward to its publication with keen in-</p><p> terest, and every issue has been a source of</p><p> stimulating thought and pleasurable entertain-</p><p> ment.</p><p> 1 have read a number of stories by Edmond</p><p> Hamilton which contained some excellent science,</p><p> and was about to inquire as to the probability of</p><p> some of his work appearing in your magazine</p><p> when I received my January copy containing</p><p> "The Comet Doom.”</p><p> | Granting the usual freedom accorded to fiction</p><p> writers in regard to the statement of unknown</p><p> or disputed facts, I am still unsatisfied by his</p><p> description of the movements and positions of</p><p> | the mythical “comet."</p><p> I Astronomy has been a hobby with me since</p><p> boyhood, and although I lay no claims to mathe-</p><p> matical genius in the realm of astro-physics. I</p><p> believe you will agree with me in the following</p><p> .statements:</p><p> 1.	The comet of the story always rises in the</p><p> east soon after sunset.</p><p> 2.	It is stated very clearly that the comet</p><p> "was swinging out again from the sun on its out-</p><p> ward journey into space.”</p><p> 3.	It is also stated tip to the climax of the</p><p> story that the comet comes closer and closer to</p><p> the earth.</p><p> Now to consider these statements:</p><p> The action of the story would have been per-</p><p> fectly logical if the comet had not risen in the</p><p> cast every tiipht soon after sunset. To have</p><p> done so it would have had to be already past the</p><p> earth and far out into space, getting farther away</p><p> every day. Had it been traveling in the path</p><p> ascribed to it, the comet would have either been</p><p> high in the sky at sunset at the beginning of</p><p> the story and farther toward the east each suc-</p><p> cessive night, as it passed the earth, or would</p><p> have risen after midnight and earlier and earlier</p><p> until it reached the position in the story, de-</p><p> pending upon the direction it followed around</p><p> the sun. Good fiction to describe its rising in</p><p> splendor in the east each night as the sun set,</p><p> but poor astronomy. Nevertheless, I shall wel-</p><p> come more stories by Edmond Hamilton.</p><p> Just a few comments on your illustrations. I</p><p> feel the urge to voice an opinion, as I am my-</p><p> self,a commercial artist and usually study illus-</p><p> trations quite carefully.</p><p> Your artist. Paul, has a combination of sev-</p><p> eral good qualities quite necessary in giving</p><p> your stories "selling punch.” C'ood |&gt;en and ink</p><p> technique, live figures in his drawings, and what</p><p> is of paramount importance to a magazine like</p><p> Amazing Stories—IMAGINATION'!</p><p> I have detected several small "slips" I wish</p><p> you would pass along. 1 cannot recall the exact</p><p> issue, but I remember noticing at the time that</p><p> in the story «f "The Singing Weapon,” Paul has</p><p> ftco bright lights shining on the form of the</p><p> Asiatic but only one shadow is cast on the wall</p><p> behind it. The story says the inventor was</p><p> killed by the smallest vibranon he had ever</p><p> made, but there are several shown which arc</p><p> smaller than the one he is holding.</p><p> 1" "The Time Machine,” if my memory is</p><p> true, Wells has his hero depart into tbe future</p><p> in a dinner coat. He arrives in "plus fours.”</p><p> In the more recent “The Psychological Solu-</p><p> tion,” the greatest mystery to me was what be-</p><p> came of the left side of the face of the man in</p><p> the background seen between Dr. Thane and the</p><p> young biologist.</p><p> But I can truthfully S3y that I have enjoyed</p><p> Paul s sketches fully as much as the stories</p><p> themselves. So as one artist to another, please</p><p> pass along my sincere appreciation of his work.</p><p> W. E. Moore,</p><p> Fremont, Ohio.</p><p> [We are hapny to find a reader of Electrical</p><p> Experimenter who is glad to meet an old friend,</p><p> I. M Alier. And by the way, none of our cor-</p><p> respondents have shown any signs of “catching</p><p> on. as the boys would say, to the meaning of</p><p> this name.</p><p> “The _ Comet Doom” is not to be taken as a</p><p> methodical treatise, but we think it a very good</p><p> story and one with considerable power. .What</p><p> we say is confirmed by the fact that our readers</p><p> have given us many favorable comments on this</p><p> very story.</p><p> We are glad that you compliment our artist,</p><p> Paul. He has a very unusual faculty for illus-</p><p> trating scientific stories into which apparatus of</p><p> all sorts enters.</p><p> As regards "The Time Machine,” it is quite</p><p> possible that the trousers that went with his din-</p><p> ner suit were of the loose Oxford cut.</p><p> The figure in “The Psychological Solution" had</p><p> his face partly bidden behind the pipe, and we</p><p> admit that by inadvertence, a little bit of the</p><p> outline seems to have been omitted.</p><p> In "The Singing Weapon,” we do not find an</p><p> obvious error in the shadows and a little indulg-</p><p> ence may be asked perhaps for the relative size</p><p> of the vibrator, which is killing the investigator</p><p> -EDITOR]</p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>87 </p><p>CRITICAL NOTES ON SEVERAL OP OUR </p><p>STORIES </p><p> Editor.

I will give</p><p> you my opinion of the various stories: Believing</p><p> at least tliat I am nearly on an equal with the</p><p> average individual who reads this issue, some</p><p> expect more, some cannot grasp the thought, and</p><p> claim it to be impossible, but looking through</p><p> the issues of magazines I have already men-</p><p> tioned and the picscnt-day achievements, 1 say</p><p> that not anything is impossible, when the time</p><p> comes for humanity to go on and use that thing</p><p> to an advantage, which seems impossible today.</p><p> These things will gather in the list of achieve-</p><p> ments as other things have in the past.</p><p> The Revolt of Pedestrians</p><p> I say it holds an inkling of the future, it</p><p> seems drastic, absurd but, for instance, today:</p><p> oflice people, not all. but a small per cent, do not</p><p> walk in a day's time, I say three miles.

The past has</p><p> already gone, and the future is yet to come.</p><p> Authors, realizing that a trip into the future</p><p> or past would make an interesting story, cast</p><p> about for scientific means of accomplishing time-</p><p> traveling. Finally, one hit upon the idea of de-</p><p> fining time as the fourth dimension and travelling</p><p> in that. Then he gave a talk with flawless proofs</p><p> that one should be able to travel in the fourth</p><p> dimension as well as any other. Very convinc-</p><p> ing, but taking too much for granted. Is time</p><p> the fourth dimension?</p><p> No, it is not. It is not a dimension any more</p><p> than mass, or weight is. You may argue that a</p><p> thing cannot exist without duration; something</p><p> that exists only instantaneously, without exist-</p><p> ing any time at all, cannot be said to exist at</p><p> all. Therefore, time is needed and is a dimen-</p><p> sion as surely as length, height and width. _ But</p><p> why pick only on time? Can a thing be said to</p><p> exist without mass?</p><p> Certainly not; that is a foolish question be-</p><p> cause something with the three dimensions has</p><p> automatically mass. There you are—something</p><p> with the three dimensions has automatically</p><p> time, or duration.</p><p> Our authors seem to have the wrong concep-</p><p> tion of a dimension. Length, height, and width</p><p> are dimensions—we can sec them, and measure</p><p> them. You can point out no object that has</p><p> other than these dimensions. They are something</p><p> tangible ina which it is possible to move. Then</p><p> why bring in an abstract term—something which</p><p> one cannot see, or touch? You cannot even talk</p><p> about time intelligently, much less define it.</p><p> The dictionary says that time is a measure of</p><p> duration. It defines duration as a continuance</p><p> IV IVil£IJI.	UUU Uimuui. A VU IVII</p><p> by how far down a spring goes when something</p><p> is pulling down on it. Everything comes bach</p><p> to the three dimensions. They arc the only</p><p> thing it is possible to be in, therefore the only</p><p> things it is possible to move in. An immaterial</p><p> term cannot lie associated with a material body.</p><p> The fourth dimension idea seems to be the prin-</p><p> cipal one used in time-traveling stories, al-</p><p> though in one, "The Astounding Discoveries of</p><p> Doctor Mentiroso," this man has a machine which</p><p> travels faster than the earth. He reasoned that</p><p> if it were 9 A. M. in San Francisco and he could</p><p> travel instantaneously to New York it would be</p><p> twelve at noon, so he would go three hours into</p><p> the future. Of coursc this type is not to he con-</p><p> sidered, and the only other time-traveling scheme</p><p> is in connection with light waves reflected from</p><p> the earth. If you capture these away out in</p><p> space the sccr.es will be re-enacted, but this is no</p><p> more traveling into the past than seeing moving</p><p> pictures.</p><p> But I believe the best proof that time-traveling</p><p> will never be attained is the absence of trav-</p><p> ellers now. The future beings do not come back</p><p> to this era, for we do not see them; and as nu</p><p> one has seen or talked with any, it means that</p><p> this ambition will never be realized. If they</p><p> recede in time at all. they will come back in-</p><p> definitely. and we would see them. What better</p><p> proof would one need?</p><p> Yes, the average reader realizes that time-</p><p> traveling stories arc a lot of "bunk," and 1</p><p> think that you will agree with me that he docs.</p><p> I hope I have made myself clear in this letter,</p><p> and I thank you for _ the opportunity of being</p><p> able to express my opinions in the magazine.</p><p>D.

DAVID H. KELLER </p><p> Cditor, Amazing Stories:</p><p>I want to tell you how very much I enjoyed </p><p>the story in your magazine for February, by Ur. </p><p>David II. Keller, "The Revolt of the Pedes- </p><p>trians.” It is far the most interesting story I </p><p>have read. It is so different—so very amazing. </p><p>It certainly gives this generation much to think </p><p>about. Many of the girls here have read the </p><p>story, and all of them liked it so well, we de- </p><p>cided to write to you and ask you to request the </p><p>author to write more of that. type. _ We will be </p><p>looking forward to more of his stories. </p><p> Florinc E. Blount,</p><p> Fort Worth, Tex.</p><p>[Dr. Keller's way of pushing to an ultimate </p><p>conclusion the effect of the automobile on man, </p><p>may do considerable good, inspiring people with </p><p>the idea that exercise is excellent for the body, </p><p>which, of course, everybody knows, but which </p><p>people seem to have forgotten, as far as walking </p><p>is concerned. </p><p> The beauty of walking is that when properly</p><p>done and in good form, the whole body is in- </p><p>volved in the process, and the mechanical per- </p><p>fection of a long-distance walker, as indicated </p><p>by his gait, is most interesting. The question </p><p>of how to walk has received much study by mili- </p><p>tary authorities, as for instance: straight-leg </p><p>walking, proper length of step, miles per hour, </p><p>and other details. The care of the foot, the </p><p>preservation of the arch, the proper shape of the </p><p>soldier's shoe, have been made the subject of a </p><p>very interesting monograph by an army officer, </p><p>and in “The Revolt of the Pedestrians," the </p><p>human foot and leg are pictured as atrophied and </p><p>pedestrianism is featured as a sort of disgrace. </p><p> There’s a lot of morality in Dr. Keller's story.</p><p> -EDITOR.]</p><p>AN ENCOURAGING AND APPRECIATIVE </p><p>LETTER </p><p> Editor, Amazing Stories:</p><p> I have been an enthusiastic follower and booster</p><p> of Amazing Stories since its first issue, but this</p><p> is the first time T have had the inspiration to</p><p> break forth into the public limelight, so here goes,</p><p> short and to the point.</p><p> I heartily endorse the suggestion made by one</p><p> of my fellow readers as to the forming of an</p><p> International Science Club, with Amazing Stories</p><p> its official organ. I think International Science</p><p> Club would he a much better name than Young</p><p> Men's Science Club, if that name doesn't conflict</p><p> with existing organizations. I am sure none of</p><p> us would object to a small fee for membership to</p><p> pay for membership cards, enrollment, etc. Then</p><p> Amazing Stories could devote a page to scientific</p><p> discussions and matters pertaining to the club.</p><p> Let’s go!</p><p> Here are a few other suggestions which I am</p><p>sure will appeal to many regarding the present </p><p>form of the magazine. You have already promised </p><p>us better quality paper, so I will pass that over. I </p><p>notice that the word SCIENT1 FICTION docs not </p><p>appear on the cov&lt;?r of the magazine at all. Now </p><p>1 think that is a sad omission, because there are </p><p>many that are not familiar with Amazing Stories </p><p>and imagine it is a concoction of weird, eerie, hair- </p><p>raising thrillers, instead of a delightful set of </p><p>stories based on scientific knowledge and fact. I </p><p>am sure the latter impression is the one most de- </p><p>sirable to cultivate. !!y all means do not consider </p><p>doing away with either the editorial page or with </p><p>the discussions and the comments. I would also </p><p>suggest a page devoted to jokes of a scientific </p><p>nature similar to the one conducted in Science </p><p>and Invention. </p><p> 1 will not commit myself as to which stories I</p><p> like or dislike as that is a matter of personal</p><p> opinion. The sooner the readers realize this and</p><p> stop panning this story or that, the better they</p><p> will enjoy the magazine, and will not tire the</p><p> patience of the other "Discussions’’ readers, by</p><p> their, "I like this,” “I think that was rotten,"</p><p> etc., and then read in the next letter exactly the</p><p> opposite opinion.</p><p> I hope I haven't tired you with all this chatter,</p><p> and hope 1 have done my bit to make Amazing</p><p> Stories what we all want it to lie.</p><p> Benjamin Domingo,</p><p> 125 Harvard Street,</p><p> Medford, Mass.</p><p> [You will find in these Discussion Columns, vari-</p><p> ous letters dealing with the cliili question, which</p><p> wc assure you, you will read with interest. But as</p><p> we said before, our readers must get up the club,</p><p> and do the organizing, and they will have the ad-</p><p> vantage of having an organ which, from its own</p><p> viewpoint, will warmly espouse the cause.</p><p> You will understand that the object of the dis-</p><p> cussions column, is precisely to let our readers</p><p> know what is thought of the magazine by others.</p><p> We make no effort to exclude unfavorable criticism</p><p> but are glad to put it in, although wc may entirely</p><p> disagree with it. Your point of view, expressed in</p><p> the next to the last paragraph of your letter,</p><p> however, just cannot be made a criterion for select-</p><p> ing letters to be printed. Wc want our readers to</p><p> understand that unfavorable criticisms are printed</p><p> in these columns without hesitation.</p><p> The better quality paper, we hope, will soon be</p><p> realized for Amazing Stories—as soon as the</p><p> magazine has been put on a paying basis.</p><p> Your suggestion to have the word “Scientifiction”</p><p> appear on the front cover is an excellent one and</p><p> has been suggested by a number of other readers.</p><p> Our Art Department has not been able to fit it on</p><p> the cover though, without crowding it.

Also you. in the present, cannot see the </p><p>future because it has not yet happened—and wc </p><p>are not optimists who think everything is "writ- </p><p>ten” and ended, that all science is in the books. </p><p>The Earih travels around the Sun and the </p><p>Sun is rushing through spacc at a bigb speed. </p><p>We know this and yet such writers as H. G. </p><p>Wells tell us that although they go back in time </p><p>without altering their position (their real posi- </p><p>tion) they find the Earth a thousand years ago </p><p>in the same place as it is today, or rather note. </p><p>Supposing you could go back in time you </p><p>would find that the earth has not readied you</p><p>yet and will not until you reach your original </p><p>present in which you were a few minutes ago </p><p>but which ts ii&lt;kv in the future. </p><p>I cannot see the necessity of having, in "Rice’s </p><p>Ray, a vacuum between the walls of the ma- </p><p>chine when they have millions of miles of </p><p>vacuum outside. </p><p>We know of the tremendous electric storms </p><p>that occur on the sun constantly. Then, why </p><p>were not Rice and his companions electrocuted </p><p>on directing the ray towards the Sun? </p><p>. Mr. Rice stales that the revolution of Venus </p><p>is of about 23 hours duration. Schiaparelli, how- </p><p>ever. has taken its "day" equal to its "year” </p><p>(225 of our days) and this I think is now taken </p><p>as correct. </p><p>1 have read practically all Verne's and Wells’ </p><p>books and I susrgest that you should publish </p><p>“Men I.ike Gods some lime or other. </p><p>1 will not say anything against Dr. Mentiroso </p><p>except that a circle has two dimensions but as </p><p>they are identical in length it is convenient </p><p>to consider one only. </p><p>It is true that some people have very little </p><p>imagination but still I wish the inhabitants of </p><p>Mars, Venus or a comet would not &lt;i/:cavj have </p><p>a head on top a body underneath and the arms </p><p>and legs at the same place as We have them. </p><p>That is the reason why 1 liked “The Men from </p><p>the Pit” and similar stories. </p><p>I don't like “prehistoric” stories as "A Story </p><p>of the Stone Age’’ and 1 wish Gravity Nullifiers </p><p>Screens and Rays were explained in a more </p><p>scientific and fuller way. </p><p> R.

But. unfortu- </p><p>nately, some people think it is the other way </p><p>and that man is evoluting downwards. Cer- </p><p>tainly the great war at the acme of our civi- </p><p>lization- and the possibility, if not probability </p><p>of any such contest,_ impending in the near </p><p>future, are sad reflections on human evolution. </p><p>Sometimes it looks as though the universe was </p><p>definite!'- going in the wrong direction. </p><p>We publish only those letters in these columns </p><p>that are of interest to the majority.

There is only one point that 1 am un- </p><p>certain about. The author states that after being </p><p>led out of its orbit the earth slowly returned to </p><p>its path around the sun. This is not true, fnr, </p><p>if the earth should slow up. as stated in the </p><p>story, it would lose part of its centrifugal force </p><p>and Hie gravitation of the sun would pull at it </p><p>with such tremendous power that the earth would </p><p>plunge into that heavenly body. Even if the </p><p>earth had been stopped the least bit. the sun's </p><p>gravity would pull the earth so near that lumin- </p><p>ous body that life on the earth would be im- </p><p>possible on account of the great heat. I would be </p><p>very much pleased if you would correct me in </p><p>any of my statements.	Edmund Perks.</p><p> New York, N.

At the second syllable, the automaton</p><p> started an electric fan. A searchlight was</p><p> turned on by a third syllable. At a fourth it</p><p> operated an automatic sweeper.

Amazing Stories:</p><p> I am morc interested in “Amazing Stories”</p><p> than in any fiction magazine published. To me,</p><p> the most amazing idea is that of “the edge ol</p><p> space,” by Ray Cummings, in "Around the Uni-</p><p> verse. ' It the atom is ether surrounded by a shell</p><p> of matter, it is possible, even probable, that the</p><p> macrocosmic spaces are also, and that we are</p><p> living in a stupendous atom. Your writers, some</p><p> of them, are coming very near the inner secrets</p><p> of the Cosmos.	Grace Pearl Bronaugh,</p><p>Oxnard, Calif. </p><p> [The idea of the "edge of space” is quite inter-</p><p> esting and the many shells ranging from atoms</p><p> up to the Cosmos certainly give a strange aspect</p><p> of the universe. Docs it not sometimes seem that</p><p> man, instead of increasing the sum of his knowl-</p><p> edge, only increases his realization of how little</p><p> he does know? Our ignorance should impress us</p><p> as a palling, and some of the wildest flights of</p><p> our imagination may approximate to future mat-</p><p> ter of fact.</p><p> Space has long been one of the mysteries of</p><p> the world. In the older philosophies it was much</p><p> discussed with little satisfactory result. The idea</p><p> ot space being curved and returning into itself</p><p> does not satisfy the intellect.—EDITOR.]</p><p>CRITICISM FROM A HIGH SCHOOL </p><p>STUDENT </p><p> Editor. Amazing Stories:</p><p> 1 have been a reader of Amazing Storif.s since</p><p> the iirst issue, which, I believe, was April, 1926.</p><p> I have enjoyed every issue immensely and have</p><p> !raised the magazine to the sky to all my friends,</p><p> t is surprising to me how few people are inter-</p><p> ested in scienti fiction or even in scientific de-</p><p> velopments of modern times. I am a Senior in</p><p> High School and of all my friends whom ] have</p><p> tried to get interested in your magazine I have</p><p> succeeded with only four or five. Of course,</p><p> these facts do not serve to show that Amazing</p><p> -Stories is not popular, it merely serves to point</p><p> out the fact that so few people (in the "teen</p><p> age”) are interested in science. However it</p><p> turns out to be true that those who are inter-</p><p> ested from the first, in this sort of reading,</p><p> become most ardent perusers afterwards. I am</p><p> looking forward to Amazing Stories to instill</p><p> into the minds of some of these uninterested</p><p> people the expansion of modern science's mar-</p><p> vels into greater marvels of future years.</p><p> Perhaps you, the editor of an “adult” maga-</p><p> zine. will net listen to the criticisms of a mere</p><p> High School student. But, as I see it, the present</p><p> High School student is fairly capable of discus-</p><p> sing science topics of today, and tomorrow, with</p><p> considerable knowledge sained from the studies of</p><p> High School science.</p><p> As to my criticism of the magazine, I have</p><p> only a few to make. I will list them in a man-</p><p> ner winch is easier to read.</p><p> 1.	The stories all satisfy me. Each author</p><p> has his own particular style which gives variety</p><p> and change,</p><p> 2.	The drawings arc certainly not artfully</p><p> drawn but they satisfy me. I would not mind</p><p> seeing more, of them.</p><p> 3.	The bindings certainly are weak for the</p><p> preservation of the magazines and I would fike</p><p> to see better ones. 1 realize, though, the cost</p><p> of better ones. I have devised a way of affix-</p><p> ing cardboard covers on my issues which make</p><p> them much stronger for keeping and reading them</p><p> over.</p><p> 4.	After reading your announcement in the</p><p> February issue of Amazing Stories about the</p><p> Quarterly I wish to state that it sounds very-</p><p> good to me.</p><p> 5._	The quality of Amazing Stories paper fully</p><p> satisfies me. I do not mind it being rough,</p><p> as it is. as long as the ink from the printing</p><p> does not blot in places and as long as the paper</p><p> docs not easily tear.</p><p> As I used io occasionally read Science ano</p><p> Invention, I used to notice some of Ray Cum-</p><p> mings serials which looked very good to me. I</p><p> wish you could consider reprinting them in</p><p> Amazing Stories.</p><p> I cannot think of any special criticism to</p><p> separate stories as I can truthfully say that I</p><p> have enjoyed every one of them. I shall be</p><p> satisfied with similar ones any time.</p><p>James Shepard Klar, </p><p>•II Dartmouth Street, Springfield, Mass. </p><p> [We have said _ over and over again that we</p><p> appreciate the criticisms of the vounger minds</p><p> because of the fact that the adult mind *is apt</p><p> to think in grooves, so when we say that wc</p><p> enjoy criticisms from the young, we'speak the</p><p> truth.</p><p> You must remember that the drawings for</p><p> our stories require peculiar treatment by the</p><p> artist. The artist has to have a scientific and</p><p> mechanical feeling in his work, and Mr. Paul</p><p> is pre-eminently good in this line.</p><p> Rough surface paper is good for the eyes. The</p><p> extensive use of half-tones in some other maga-</p><p> zines has brought about the use of glossy paper,</p><p> which is most disagreeable for the reader.</p><p> As regards reprinting stories from Science ano</p><p> Invkntion, this is something wc cannot do too</p><p> freely. Many of our readers are old time friends</p><p> of S. IKNCF. and Invention and we have to think</p><p> of them, but we feel that it is a practice which</p><p> we can very well carry out occasionally.—</p><p> EDIT OR.]</p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>93 </p><p>Earn Money </p><p>Experimenting </p><p> The Skinderviken Transmit-</p><p> tci unit is a marvel of En-</p><p> gineering design—a practical</p><p> miniature transmitter, used</p><p> by thousands of radio fans</p><p> and experimenters for am-</p><p> plification purposes.</p><p> It is a most novel unit,</p><p> having hundreds of uses.</p><p>WE PAY $5.00 </p><p>IN CASH </p><p> for every new use developed for this unit</p><p> and accepted and published by us.

Amazing Stories:</p><p> After having read the February issue of</p><p> Amazing Stories, I wish t’o state tny preference</p><p> of the stories. Here it is in order: "'lhe Revolt</p><p> of the Pedestrians,” “Pollock and the Porroh</p><p> Man," "Baron Munchhausen’s Scientific Adven-</p><p> tures." "Four Dimensional Surgery,” "The</p><p> Fighting Heart," "The Disintegrating Ray,”</p><p> "The Fourteenth Earth,” “Smoke Kings.”</p><p> I do not wish to forget the poems by Leland</p><p> S. Copeland. They are very interesting and</p><p> serve as food for thought.</p><p> In regard to Baron Munchhausen, I find in the</p><p> Stratford edition of his travels published by lhe</p><p> F. M. Lupton Publishing Co., .New York (no</p><p> dale given), the following:</p><p> “In fact, recent investigation has rendered</p><p> it almost a certainty that the original author of</p><p> ‘.Munchhausen’s Travels' was a learned but un-</p><p> principled scholar, of the name of R. E. Raspe,</p><p> who had taken refuge in this country from the</p><p> pursuit of justice (vide Gentleman's Magasine, Jan-</p><p> uary, 1867), and that many of his stories are of</p><p> ancient date, and current in various countries.</p><p> Many are to be found under the title of 'Men-</p><p> dacia Ridicula,' in volume 3 of ‘Deliciae Aca-</p><p> demicae.’ Ileilhron, 1665; that of 'sound being</p><p> frozen in a post-horn' is from Rabelais, appears</p><p> to have been known also in Spain and Italy, and</p><p> is said by a writer in 'Notes and Queries' (No.</p><p> 61, 1850) to be traceable to one of the later Greek</p><p> writers, from whom Jeremy Taylor, in one of</p><p> his sermons, borrows it as an illustration; while</p><p> lhe story of 'lhe horse cut in two by the por-</p><p> cullis' is translated by Lady C. Guest, in 'The</p><p> Mabinogion.' from an ancient Welsh manuscript.”</p><p> In line with Mr. Ostrander's suggestion, I</p><p> would like to see Edgar Allan Poe’s story, "The</p><p> Thousand-and-Second Talc of Scheherazade,”</p><p> printed in Amazing Stories.</p><p>I am not in favor of having a semi-monthly </p><p>magazine, but think the “Quarterly" is excellent. </p><p> Earle Floathe.</p><p> 611 Walnut St., Pendleton, Ore.</p><p> [We arc glad to get the list of the stories which</p><p> you prefer, in the order of preference. We arc</p><p> very glad to note that Pollock and the Porroh</p><p> Man is in a high position, because the story im-</p><p> pressed its veiy vividly with a sense of horror,</p><p> as it might be expressed, and it certainly de-</p><p> velops a fine line of hypnotic effects’ and</p><p> impressions.</p><p> The temperature of the tropic world is very</p><p> well given and it is in the production of at-</p><p> mosphere that Mr. Wells particularly excels. It</p><p> will be of interest to note that he is a gradu-</p><p> ate with honor, in Zoology.</p><p> Your notes on Baron Munchhausen are very</p><p> interesting and go to carry out the proverb that</p><p> there is nothing new under the sun.</p><p> We’re glad to tell you that Edgar Allan Poe’s</p><p> story; The Thousand and-Second Talc of Schehera-</p><p> zade," is to have an early publication in Amazing</p><p> Stories.—EDITOR.]</p><p>THE ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY- </p><p>WELLS AND VERNE </p><p> Editor, Amazing Stories:</p><p> February number just here today. What is</p><p> the matter with the magazine lately? Have</p><p> noticed during the last few months that it seems</p><p> to be coming later and later.</p><p> Congratulate you on your decision to publish</p><p> a Quarterly in addition to the monthly. Only</p><p> kick I have refers to the reprints. The Annual</p><p> was about half spoiled by reprints; at least give</p><p> us the Quarterly of new stuff. I like H. G. Wells,</p><p> and “When the Sleeper Wakes" is a good story</p><p> but I can't get nearly as much kick out of reading</p><p> it again, as I could out of some story I had never</p><p> seen.</p><p> Another suggestion that incidentally backs up</p><p> one which I read some months ago in the section</p><p> used for discussions. If the present conditions</p><p> do not permit publishing much but reprints, why</p><p> not scatter your, stories a trifle morc and not</p><p> give us so much of Wells, Verne and others.</p><p> Jules Verne and Wells edition after edition. I</p><p> like Wells fairly well but Verne is terrible.</p><p> Indoubtedly he has an imagination and pruphe-</p><p> cied amazingly for his time and period, but</p><p> outside of his ability to describe well and his</p><p> gift of imagination he is a very dim bulb. His</p><p> "Frycollin” in that last atrocity “Robur the</p><p> Conqueror” would make a horse laugh. You</p><p> can't expect a dyed-in-the-wool Frenchman to</p><p> have an Anglo-Saxon sense of humor and “Car-</p><p> rolesquc” Anglo Saxon altitude. The characters</p><p> strike me as pathetic. Almost as bad as the</p><p> slapstick humor in the funny (?) stories you</p><p> have been running.</p><p> Almost missed the second instalment of that</p><p> particular tale—passed it up until I had to buy</p><p> it because I wanted something to read and</p><p> couldn’t seem to see anything else. The rest of</p><p> it was very good even if 1 had read Wells’</p><p> “The Stolen Body” umpteen times in various</p><p> magazines and hooks.</p><p> Mr. Middleton’s rather lengthy letter was in-</p><p> teresting, though I cannot wholly agree with</p><p> him, especially in his criticism of "The War of</p><p> the Worlds.” The narrator was not very much</p><p> concerned with what the rest of England was</p><p> doing. He was simply telling what befell him</p><p> and those with whom he was intimately con-</p><p> nected. The rest was a dream of noises more</p><p> or less, and probably Mr. Middleton, if placed</p><p> in a like position today, would not pause to</p><p> get a copy of the Examiner or consult the Boston</p><p> Globe as to what someone else thought. He would</p><p> be making tracks as far apart as possible.

G. Wells is perhaps the most discussed author,</p><p> his Stories exciting the dislike of some people</p><p> and eliciting praise from others. Some people</p><p> directly ask fur reprints as from SCIENCE and</p><p> Invention and others object to reprints. You</p><p> do not like Jules Verne, who made an immense</p><p> reputation and whose wild extravaganzas, have</p><p> in many cases, proved the fore-runners of man's</p><p> everyday achievements of late years- Is not</p><p> the fact that Jules Verne's stories have been</p><p> put upon the film and have won great success</p><p> with the audiences a tribute to their merit?</p><p> The idea of the Discussions Column and what</p><p> we wish to be a prominent feature of it, is the</p><p> publication of unfavorable as well as favorable</p><p> letters. The unfavorable criticisms arc in many</p><p> cases useful guides, but it is really a puzzle to</p><p> know what to do. When a controversy _ exists</p><p> about a particular author, and is carried on</p><p> .energetically on both sides, ask yourself what</p><p> would you do if you were in our place?</p><p> • The funny stories to which you object, have</p><p> impressed us and many others very favorably.</p><p> Do you not think that if you had a little more</p><p> "Anglo-Saxon” humor, as you call it, in your</p><p> composition, that you would appreciate them</p><p> more? You like “Alice in Wonderland” and "in</p><p> the Looking Glass." We know that we enjoy</p><p> the "funny stories" you dislike, and it is hard</p><p> to believe that the things which so impressed</p><p> one, did not impress another at all.—EDITOR.]</p><p>A WELCOME TO THE QUARTERLY- </p><p>WHAT IS SOUND? </p><p> Editor. Amazing Stories:</p><p> I've been reading Amazing Stories for a very</p><p> long time and I run well pleased to hear about</p><p> the Quarterly.</p><p> I find your stories very exciting and in fact</p><p> when 1 start In read the book if it isn't loo</p><p> late—why I’ll sit down and read the whole book</p><p> in a few hours' time.</p><p> Your stories really grip and when you start</p><p> to read them you can't let go.</p><p> There’s a question T would like to ask you,</p><p> a very puzzling question which got me into many</p><p> quarrels with my friends.</p><p> The question is—Noise is made by the ear,</p><p> am I not right?</p><p> Now then suppose a .38-calibre pistol was fired</p><p> off way out in the woods by means of a string</p><p> or something else, and there wasn't anything</p><p> around to hear it.</p><p> Did it make a noise? I brought this subject</p><p> up to my friends and when I said it didn't make</p><p> a noise they all laughed at me.</p><p> Now here is my point of view—if noise is</p><p> made by the ear and nobody around 10 hear it.</p><p> of course it didn't make a noise.</p><p> I’ve heard noise is only vibrations which the</p><p> ear transforms to sound.</p><p> Now take a deaf man—a gun is fired, the sound</p><p> vibrations are there, but his ears won't make</p><p> sound and of course he can’t hear it. The same</p><p> with the gun out in the. woods. Am I not right?</p><p> I am hoping I w;ill sec this question answered</p><p> in your next edition of Amazing Stories as it</p><p> has caused me very much confusion with my</p><p> friends.</p><p> I liked your story of The Comcl Doom in your</p><p> January edition, and I found it so very inter-</p><p> esting I read the story three times.</p><p> Arthur White,</p><p>1139 Bank St., Curti, Ohio. </p><p> EVhether the pistol fired in the desert of</p><p> ara, would maxe a noise or not, is a matter</p><p> of definition—a question of the subjective and</p><p> the objective. The subjective definition of noise</p><p> would be. wc suppose, vibrations of air affecting</p><p> the auditory nerves. A good objective one would</p><p> be vibrations of air within the range of audition.</p><p> You sec, the second definition does not include</p><p> the idea of a hearer. The question has been</p><p> asked over and over again and has been dis-</p><p> cussed to the point of weariness._ Our general</p><p> advice would be for you to treat it as a matter</p><p> of definition, and before attempting to argue</p><p> about it, to gel an authoritative statement ot</p><p> what class of noise you are to speak about.</p><p> Webster’s Dictionary gives two definitions of</p><p> sound which correspond closely to the subjective</p><p> and objective definitions of noise given above.</p><p> So if the pistol was fired, by a time fuse or</p><p> otherwise, so that nobody could hear it. we might</p><p> call that objective sound. If it was heard, it</p><p> would be subjective sound.

G. WF.LI-S GIVES HIS </p><p>VIEWS ON TIME TRAVEL </p><p>liditor. Amazing Stories: </p><p>After having read your magazine regularly, for </p><p>over a year. I am lending you, for the first time, </p><p>my reader# vote of preference and a few re- </p><p>marks. </p><p>I have been reading your "Discussions” dc- </p><p>Iiartmcnt, aud have noted with surprise the nuni- </p><p>icr of people who do not like the stories of II. 0. </p><p>Wells, when, as a matter of fact, there is no </p><p>writer in the scicntiliction field with a more ab- </p><p>sorbing style, or with more imagination and origi- </p><p>nality. Mis tendency to detail and his keenness </p><p>of observation only testify to the greatness of </p><p>his marvelous mind. It is my opinion that the </p><p>people who dislike his work are usually of the </p><p>kind whose idea of a good -.lory is a hectic melo- </p><p>drama glorifying action—preferably absurd action </p><p>—and without a single worthwhile thought to </p><p>commend it to the intelligent reader. </p><p>I should like to add a word to the "time travel” </p><p>discussion which "The Astounding Discoveries </p><p>of Doctor Mentiroso" and "The Time Machine” </p><p>seem to’ltave started. The incredible thing about </p><p>traveling in time seems to me to be the indefinite </p><p>extension of the span of life of any human being </p><p>undertaking a time journey. In "The Tune Ma- </p><p>chine," Mr. Wells projects himself so far into </p><p>the future that Jie sees the world stationary, with </p><p>one face always toward the sun. And yet he </p><p>lives; When, logically, he should have killed </p><p>himself at the very start by passing the par- </p><p>ticular period in lime when his death would </p><p>naturally have occurred. </p><p>I	am twenty-six years of age. I may live to</p><p>lie seventy-six. I.et us suppose that a time ma- </p><p>chine could be invented which would enable me </p><p>to travel tifty years into the future. I would </p><p>then be seventy-six. If 1 traveled farther, I </p><p>should die and be automatically incapacitated </p><p>for further travel in time—or space. If my con- </p><p>sciousness could live on and continue traveling </p><p>after the death of my body, it is possible that </p><p>1	could reach that far-distant time of which</p><p>Wells tells, but I would not then have any such </p><p>adventures as those of which he tells. Were I. </p><p>on the other hand, to travel into the past, I</p><p>could only travel to tli&lt;- extent of twenty-six </p><p>years. Did 1 travel farther than that, 1 should </p><p>be unborn—non-existent—and again incapable of </p><p>further travel. If I cut my travels snort after, </p><p>say, twenty years of "paslward” progress. I </p><p>should undoubtedly see things as they were </p><p>twenty years ago, but by the same token I should </p><p>see them with the eyes of a six-year-old child. </p><p>Is not that self-evident? </p><p>However, by all means, continue giving us </p><p>such stories. Even though they may be impos- </p><p>sible. they are tremendously interesting,. And </p><p>do not cut down our rations of Wells. Give us </p><p>more, if anything. </p><p>Snch objections as those which Mr. Butler of </p><p>Taft, California, advances against "The War of </p><p>the Worlds.’' seem to me childish. He speaks of </p><p>the impossibility of slugs or mice developing in- </p><p>telligence. and cites, as proof, the fact that the </p><p>human race has outstripped such creatures, on </p><p>earth. If I understand Wells, however, one of </p><p>the things he most desires to make plain, is </p><p>that, other forms may have developed our own </p><p>dominant characteristics, mentally speaking, on </p><p>other worlds: in fact, that this is more likely </p><p>than not.
