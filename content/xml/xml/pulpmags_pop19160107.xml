                <seg type="columnLine">had been recently occupied. Allen</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">glanced at his watch. His appointment</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">had been for nine. It still lacked ten</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">minutes of the hour. He took a chair</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">and settled himself to wait.</seg>
            </ab>
            <ab>
                <seg type="columnLine">Some time had elapsed--more than</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">ten minutes--when Allen was roused</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">out of the semireverie into which he</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">had fallen by the sound of voices in</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">the hall outside the door. The voices</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">were not loud, but they were clearly</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">angry. With the bristling of interest</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">with which man recognizes a fight,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Allen sat up alertly and listened. He</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">could distinguish nothing except that</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">two men were talking at the same time.</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Then there was the sound of a scuffle,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">immediately followed by two shots</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">from a revolver. Forgetting all reason</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">for keeping himself inconspicuous,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Allen sprang for the door. He could</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">not open it at once--it seemed to be</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">held from the outside. Then he</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">wrenched it open, and a man fell in</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">upon his arms--a man whose limp hand</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">seemed to have just fallen from the</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">knob.</seg>
            </ab>
            <ab>
                <seg type="columnLine">Allen let him down upon the floor,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">and knelt beside him. It took but an</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">instant's examination for Allen to sat-</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">isfy himself that the man was done</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">for. He had been shot through the</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">temple, and might almost be said to</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">have died instantly. As Allen rose</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">from his knees, he suddenly realized</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">how this affair must affect him. A</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">murdered man in the room with him--</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">it would mean publicity, investigation,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">possibly arrest and search--and he had</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Rantoul's letters to Gordon in his</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">pocket! A sudden question that came</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">into his mind made him glance sharply</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">again at the dead man. No, this could</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">by no possibility be Gordon; this w as</seg>

                <seg type="columnLine">At the age of thirty Tom Warren felt he had gotten nowhere in the world, being merely an</seg>

                <seg type="columnLine">that Tom lacked backbone and ambition. So her father thought, too. Old John Spencer was a maq of</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">ability and money, and he disliked to think that his daughter had given her heart to a man of small</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">caliber. Opium was being smuggled into San Francisco in incredible quantities. No one seemed to</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">be able to stop it. Graham, the deputy inspector, was under suspicion. One day a seeret-serviee agent</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">from Washington comes on to Frisco to investigate. In &amp; moment of anger and haste Tom Warren declares</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">that he could round up the Opium Ring, if he had the chance. Graves, the seeret-service man, tells</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Tom that his wish is granted; that he has six months in which to prove his boast. With some trepi-</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">dation at the magnitude of his task, Warren begins his hunting down of the powerful opium interests.</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">A faithful German, Karl Wemple, and a young chap named Lind are his trusties. At the end of five</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">weeks Tom is on the trail hot-foot. Lind has observed some queer checking of boxes consigned to one</seg>
