            <seg type="columnLine">into a part of the jungle where a kill had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the carcass of an animal slain by the tiger</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Furthermore, it usually shuns dens and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">very rarely hunts long in one particular</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was an auspicious sign. Besides, some</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">vanished in the jungle. Mortimer was con-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">waited till daylight, and searched for the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> As we were afraid the beast might get</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">So I told them to walk behind, for I could</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Eventually we reached a point where the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ravine made an abrupt turn past a small</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thicket of tamarisk. We divided our forces.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mortimer going one side and I the other.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">As I came to the end of the thicket, a water*</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hole met my view and what I desired to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">see more than anything else--there was the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tiger, lying in the water with only his head</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out. Taking careful aim. I fired, but though</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">my -hot hit. it did not kill. With a short,</seg>

        <ab>            
            <seg type="columnLine">and rushed around the other side of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">from Mortimer's express, a roar, and then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a cry for help. Running toward him at top</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">speed, I saw a sight that made my blood</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">run cold. Mortimer was on the ground, his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">white clothing covered with blood, while</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">standing over him, its mouth dripping with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gore, was the tiger. The shikarees who had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">our extra rifles and had gone by another</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">route to the pool, came rushing up, breaking</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">through the bush almost opposite the tiger.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">In a moment it charged them and they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">opened fire, but none of their shots stopped</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the brute. One of the shikarees dropped his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gun and ran; the other stood, firing as the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beast advanced. When the magazine was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">empty the native tried to reload it, but too</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">late; for the mighty bulk of the animal flew</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">through the air and bore the unlucky fellow</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to earth. For some reason the beast used</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">only its claws. It fell over the body of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man, and then began wiping its face with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">its paw like a house cat.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> I got down on the ground and crawled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nearer to get a better shot. A cobra in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">grass raised his head in front of me, thrust</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out his tongue, and vanished. At last I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was within easy range. I got on my knee</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and lired, and at the shot the tiger sank in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a limp heap on its victim, dead. When I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reached Mortimer, he was sitting up, wiping</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the blood from his clothes with grass. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">told his story: "You'd no sooner lired than</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">vety, like like black pansies! That was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">precisely what they were- saucy, wide-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">awake black pansies, the most beautiful</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">kling in the most roguish manner imagi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nable, as at the present moment. Her black</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hair was soft and line, entirely free from the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">it grew down upon her temples in a way that</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that she was considerably below the usual</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">height, but so perfectly proportioned that</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">quite how the fact was plain, but there is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">no way to tell of countless sweet certainties.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Hetty was in white, new white, her ruftled</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">her long silk gloves were white, new white.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">But all these one left for the look of her</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">happiness, and the look of her cheeks, which</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">And for Hetty the self-consciousness of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Smith could hear every- word that was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Of course, the express companies come first</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">&lt;&gt;n the list. These vampires, preying alike upon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the railways and the public, are merely a set of</seg>
