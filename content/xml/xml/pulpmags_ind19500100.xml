We roamed the great open places of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Northwest with care-free hearts. Buf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">falo, while not overly abundant, were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous enough to provide us plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">food and excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fishing was excellent, and I fell into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mode of the primitive with such fervor</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I would never have given it up, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fate had not held a black card in her hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my friend and mentor, Sitting Bull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half dozen times we engaged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushes with Crows, who were continually</seg><seg type="columnLine">laying in wait to steal our horses whenever</seg><seg type="columnLine">we happened to be near their haunts. And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I must say I rather enjoyed their forays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because they served to break the monotony</seg><seg type="columnLine">of camp life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sitting Bull had been so well pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the improvement in general marks-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manship of his warriors, which he attribu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted to a large extent to my assistance, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I seemed to grow in his favor, and I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve I was shown as many privileges in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp as was Crowfoot himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Late in the spring, Sitting Bull, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently was most anxious for me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn all of the nature-craft for which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sioux were famous, assigned me to scout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing duty, and even condescended to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my companions on our first trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A day out from camp, we ran across a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small band of Crows, who had been hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing onto our flank, and occasionally pick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up a few of our stray ponies. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtook them after a wild ride across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of their number, who was appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently in command, wore an elaborate head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress of yellow feathers. I never did know'</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name, but apparently those gimlet-eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sitting Bull were able to make him out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although he was then half a mile away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See," Sitting Bull said, as he reined</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pony beside me, "the Crow with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow feathers.

If we get him, we will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be bothered again soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew from the intonation and gestures</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he wished the honor of killing the In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dian rustler to rest on my shoulders, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed away with all the speed of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pony was capable, swinging to the left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and circling with a view to cutting off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fugitive Crows before they could reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">some hills in the distance, which they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently trying to make, before giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half dozen of the Unkpappas fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed close behind me at top speed, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was probably a half hour before we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in range. But it was no ordinary Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse thieves we had encountered. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">could ride like centaurs, were well armed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knew how to use their weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing that they would be unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the hills before giving battle, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled, and dropping along the sides of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ponies, with their rifles sticking out</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the necks of their steeds, they swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">at right angles to us and began a hot fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MY LIFE WITH SITTING BULL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The range, however, was too great at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outset, and their bullets merely kicked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rain of dust some two hundred feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Appearing Elk, who was a perfect devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a fight, shot past me with a warwhoop</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would awaken the dead, and dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly at the enemy, while I pounded my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony's ribs in an effort to make it keep up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my friend. We had scarcely arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">in range when a bullet passed through Ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearing Elk's shoulder, and caused him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop his rifle, and a moment later his pony</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shot from under him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing the foremost Sioux fall, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crow in the yellow headdress turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly to his left, and rode straight for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, holding his rifle against his shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his bow and arrow in easy reach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time I had reached the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Appearing Elk, who was lying on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, blood trickling down his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscular arm, which was now rendered</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless, signing for me to pay no attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, but to open up on the enemy. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang from my pony, held the rein over</seg><seg type="columnLine">my arm, and took deliberate aim at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly yelling Crow who was bearing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As my big Sharp's cracked, he threw up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands and leaned backward, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony's speed was unchecked, and he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued his wild charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I quickly reloaded my gun, and fired a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second shot, which struck the pony in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and brought it to its knees, probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten yards in front of me, while the rider</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hurled almost at my feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Crow held up his hands for mercy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had lost his weapons in the fall, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite powerless anyhow, as blood was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gushing from a hole in his chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later, Appearing Elk sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet, and with his uninjured left arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">had raised his rifle high above him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to bring it crashing down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his enemy's head, when we heard a shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">yell behind us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the voice of Sitting Bull. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had started with the other Sioux who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung to the left after the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crow band, brought down one of the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">emy, and then had turned to witness the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outcome of my little private fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No/' cried the Chief.

Do not let your wound</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">make a brute of you "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later he was beside us, bu</seg><seg type="columnLine">the death rattie was in the wounded man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. I picked up his rifle, tore off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">headdress, which I presented to the Chief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a moment later we were off after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the wildly scurrying Crows. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time they had been so badly shot up</seg><seg type="columnLine">that only two or three of the original</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve were giving real battle. The skirm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish did not last much longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Appearing Elk's shoulder was badly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jured, and another Sioux had been killed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but aside from these there were no casual-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties, although only two of the Crows, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as we were able to determine, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">their escape. That night, as we sat about</seg><seg type="columnLine">our campfire, Sitting Bull placed his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my shoulder in the presence of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire little band, and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eagle Eyes, my heart beats for you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You have killed the thieving chief whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hate. You have saved Appearing Elk's</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. You have a Dacotah's heart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His kind words fanned my pride to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame, to be sure, but they did not thrill me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as the knowledge that I had really</seg><seg type="columnLine">repaid Appearing Elk for his good turn in</seg><seg type="columnLine">preventing me from being gored to death</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a buffalo in my neophyte days. I thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed myself, falteringly, to Sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His only reply was a grunt and a shrug</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shoulders, which may or may not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have indicated satisfaction s*#ith my reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FROM that time on I acted as a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodyguard and a sort of gunman for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sitting Bull. Never again did I participate</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any actual fights in which the Chief was</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged. But on several occasions he di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected me to watch out for his particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies when I was on scout duty, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">accounted for three of his most hated foes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his great delight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By midsummer the Chief's attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. He was apparently preoccupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">and worried. He was often in council</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Gall, Lone Bull, Crazy Horse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">others of the powerful Sioux chiefs he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gathered about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not know what the trouble was</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, but I know now it was because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difficulties the Sioux were having with</seg><seg type="columnLine">16</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INDIAN STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the whites.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Big Horn territory and the Nbrth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Platte had been ceded to the Sioux by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government, and no white man, under its</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms, was permitted to settle there, or to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass through without the Indian's permis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. But the treaty was even then being</seg><seg type="columnLine">violated, and a year later it was shame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully disregarded by the whites when gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">was discovered in the Black Hills, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush of prospectors to Dakota and Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tana occurred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But in the fall of '75 even war clouds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were hanging low over us, although I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">kept in perfect ignorance of the situation,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and evidently was assigned to tasks that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would keep me from coming into contact</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the whites, or learning what was go-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Fowler and I seldom saw each other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I doubt if he knew much more of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">true condition of affairs than I, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his great experience he stood a much</seg><seg type="columnLine">better chance of getting correct infor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For weeks the Sioux had been promised</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a Sun Dance, and at last the long delayed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">event was held. It was the first and last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one I ever care to see, a test of courage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and endurance that brings a shudder to me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">every time it comes to my mind. Just why</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this dance was held at this time now be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">comes significant, but it meant nothing un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">usual to me then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A young brave comes out to participate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the dance. Quickly a sub-chief assigned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the task takes a keen knife and makes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two deep slits in the muscles of his back,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">just over the kidneys. The dancer must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not allow an eyelash to quiver or a sound</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to escape his lips, but must stand erect</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">while a rawhide thong, suspended from a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pole, is passed through the bleeding slits,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and he is lifted off the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If he stands the task with the stoicism</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">required, he has proven his bravery. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he has shown the slightest sigh of weaken-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing, or faints, he is branded a squaw, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">must be henceforth treated as one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A half dozen or more young braves went</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through this sickening ceremony with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">credit to themselves, according to their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">standards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then out stepped one of the most hand-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some Indians I have ever seen, muscled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">^ like a .Greek god, and his face bearing the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">expression of a zealot who has flogged his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">courage to the sticking point, and is eager</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and willing to step into the flames, and die</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a martyr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood like a statue while a muscular</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand grabbed the flesh back of his kidneys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rudely thrust a hunting knife through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. There was never a quiver when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation was repeated a second time, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the rawhide thong was drawn tight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was swept off the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do what you will," he shouted, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood trickled down his swinging legs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a pool beneath him. "No one can</seg><seg type="columnLine">wring a moan from my lips. I have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of a Dacotah. I wonder if all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you who look on can say as much ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taunting his torturers, defying them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">apply more violence, and boasting of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage, which although I had never seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">him before I knew was of the greatest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though the test before my very eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not demonstrated it to me, he swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some time, and then the flesh gave way</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he fell to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaping up with a smile of triumph,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rain-in-the-Face shouted:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have I not proven my words ? If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt me, you may swing me up again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SITTING BULL, who had stood like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of sculpture, his gimlet-eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing as he heard the boasting of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brave, was apparently much displeased</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the cockiness of the warrior and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">taunts he had thrown out while undergo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the torture. Perhaps Sitting Bull felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Rain-in-the-Face, ambitious to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">a powerful Sioux leader, had aimed some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his taunts at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With raised hand he stepped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do as he has bid you," the Chief ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. "Make the cuts deeper, and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">him dance again. Perhaps his courage is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not quite as great as he would have us</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sitting Bull fixed his fiery eyes on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger man, who met them steadily, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the utmost indifference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the cruel knives tore more deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his flesh. Again the rawhide thong</seg><seg type="columnLine">was passed through the wounds, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hoisted into the air, singing, shouting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waving his long sinewy arms in a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wild rhythm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MY LIFE WITH SITTING BULL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">17</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could stand the sight no longer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrew. But the Sun Dance went on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The following day I returned for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, because I did not believe it possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Rain-in-the-Face was still enduring</seg><seg type="columnLine">that intense suffering without a moan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there he was as before, only now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was swinging more vigorously, kicking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an effort to force the tortured muscles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tear loose, and permit him to escape, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">defiant and haughty as when he had first</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped into the circle to meet the ordeal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still a second day I returned, drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the spot by the horror of it. His legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">encrusted with coagulated blood, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarlet trickle still oozing from around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel thong, but with his face aflame, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spirit undaunted, the warrior was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">defiant as ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now his suffering was to cease.

A moment later two heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffalo skulls were tied to the feet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended stoic. You could see the mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles start to rip as the heavy weights were</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached, but the war song only increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">in clearness as Rain-in-the-Face kicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tugged to show his indifference</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last, after two days, the flesh could</seg><seg type="columnLine">withstand the strain no longer, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stoic dropped to the ground on the buffalo</seg><seg type="columnLine">skulls. Quickly he arose to his feet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing to the throng about him, his fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger moving in a circle, he cried:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now do you believe in me, or am I a</seg><seg type="columnLine">squaw ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sitting Bull strode forward, placed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on the bronzed shoulder of the war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rior whose lower limbs were reeking with</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood, and shouted in words and tones</seg><seg type="columnLine">which permitted no misinterpretation:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Rain-in-the-Face, you are not a squaw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are others as brave as the Dacotahs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are no Dacotahs braver than you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hereafter you will sit high in the councils</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Dacotahs, and you will be a scourge</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our enemies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the tortured hero was carried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tepee on the shoulders of admiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends, amid the wildest shouts of ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proval, in which I joined with all the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">3--Indian Stories--Winter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of my lungs.

Their gaudy blankets reveal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing only their glistening black hair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusky faces, the women gathered together</seg><seg type="columnLine">and did not speak. Not understanding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and afraid because they could not under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, the children crouched close to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mothers and either whimpered softly or</seg><seg type="columnLine">were silent. Two of the Shoshone war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors, bows in their hands and a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">heap of arrows by their side, sat at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the trail. Any Pahkee who at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted the ascent had to come up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path, and there was room for only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">person at a time on it.

All through the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">campment forms were moving with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet dignity that gave purpose to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement, and here and there a horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with the sacred red and yellow sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bols of the Auhuminea, the camp-police,</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted on his bronzed skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the shade of a tipi Kitsipon, son of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hunkpapa chief, Thunder Face, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching Daybreak Star through the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">flap of her father's lodge. He was tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and handsome, but he was young and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had yet to take an enemy's scalp and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, no eagle's feather tipped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse hair dangled from his glossy head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood watching the girl, his face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">impassive; while under his fine blanket</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart pounded like a dance drum. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was always so when he looked upon Day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">break Star. The more so now because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of the tipi was growing very long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was a tryst to keep down by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river where the black-throated buntings</seg><seg type="columnLine">sang and swayed on the reeds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, the shadow reached to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gradually deepened.

She stood for a moment, tall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender, her braided hair flowing in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">glossy streaks over her fringed deerskins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her eyes found Kitsipon. She smiled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then took the trail down to the river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitsipon waited for a time then followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl, his step had the spring of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow in it, but it was not indecorously</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SHADOW of the cottonwoods</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fringed the river fell across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunkpapa section of the camp. A steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail led through them down to the sandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottoms. A barred owl sent his booming</seg><seg type="columnLine">call echoing through the woods, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whip-poor-will scolded like an old woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitsipon quickened his pace as he passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from sight of the camp. But scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he entered the darkening woods when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a horse blew loudly through its nostrils,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then suddenly a tall figure stepped out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bush, and came to a stand on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A swift flame of anger came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitsipon's eyes as he recognized Ingrona,</seg><seg type="columnLine">son of the Hukpapa shaman, Long Ghost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ingrona spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is a thing that troubles my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind.

"Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not the time to talk of this thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubles your mind, Ingrona," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come to my father's lodge tonight. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">will talk then." He made as if to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the trail, but Ingrona quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped into his path, and confronted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We talk now," he said, and folded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms across his deep chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitsipon stood utterly motionless, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing deeply into the other's eyes. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a two-feather man, this Ingrona, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the savage, alert look of his name-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake, the panther. He always wore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finest buckskins, and under his blanket he</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried a long knife. He was older than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitsipon by three summers. As far back</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Kitsipon could remember the shaman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">son had always been standing in his path.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was strange, but always he seemed not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to want a thing until Kitsipon reached out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand to grasp it. It had been so since</seg><seg type="columnLine">childhood, and this had made them strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivals at every turn. And now, it seemed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were to be rivals in love; for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no chance meeting, the scowl on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ingrona's face told Kitsipon that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is this thing that troubles your</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Last night my father spoke of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing.

Steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed as he crouched, the fingers of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand touching the ground. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment of silence, in which their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked as each sought to measure the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of the other's resolution.

And then Kitsipon sprang at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ingrona was too quick for him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped aside and his long knife ripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Kitsipon's buckskin shirt but did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not draw blood. Kitsipon whirled to attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. But just then hoof beats sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the trail. Out of the tail of his eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitsipon saw his father galloping toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, followed by two of the camp-police.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feathers fluttered from the ceremonial</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe the old chief carried in his hand.

Gritting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth Kitsipon sheathed his knife and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent. Thunder Face dropped from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony, and the look he gave his son was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade as the thunder cloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is well," he said bitingly, "that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have girls to watch our young men.

Wolves, drawn by the scent of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, howled out in the hills. The dogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">slinked to the shelter of the lodges, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, with the hair standing along their</seg><seg type="columnLine">backs, answering the challenge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plains in low, gruff yelps--they could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark, there was too much wolf in them</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, the voice of Mitevwin, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big, medicine drum, spoke to the night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the camp-crier came shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the camp, calling the Scalp Shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men to the council lodge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitsipon stood outside his father's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lodge, looking out toward the hills.

She had borne four sons;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but three had died long ago, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart was full of fear for the one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was left to her.

"I give no</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponies to Long Ghost, or his son. May I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never set foot in another snow if I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">that!" He put more wood on the fire. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackled and flared, pushed back the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows and showed the clean, proud lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his young face.

To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, Daybreak Star, I say this: The</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughters of the Dakota are free to chose</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own men. But this I say to her also:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wankan Tanka will show her which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the better man.

At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the signal one of the horsemen dug his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels into the belly of his pony. He dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the ring, swooped down to pick up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blanket, came up whirling it about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and ga^e tongue to the Dakota war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hie--yah-h-h-h--yeep, yeep!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dust he had kicked up in his passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">MOCCASINED DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was still rising- when Kitsipon and Ingrona</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang at each other.

As a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean trial of strength it was beautiful to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch. Their powerful thigh and back</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles knotted, strained and quivered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But not an inch of ground was yielded, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ingrona knew that he had met his equal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could not win by strength alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They broke and circled, as light-footed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a pair of catamounts. Then suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitsipon rushed in and wound his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Ingrona's waist. The people shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they saw the shaman's son lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder high. But Ingrona's body writhed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twisted like a snake, and Kitsipon</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not retain his hold long enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete the throw'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They broke and circled again. Near</seg><seg type="columnLine">defeat had shaken Ingrona's nerve, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth was ugly, his throat snarling. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, he bounded forward and kicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitsipon in the groin. As Kitsipon doubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">lip and rolled on the ground in agony the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women scolded Ingrona shrilly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In such a contest as this no hold or</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow was banned, but in the proud hearts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Dakota there was no place for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who stooped to win by a mean blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">or trick. The young men of the Ogala and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other clans cried out: "Shame!" And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunkpapa braves, feeling the sting of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jeered Ingrona and shouted at Kitsipon:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Akakimat, akakimat! Stay with it! Up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitsipon--up !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INGRONA advanced upon them, shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and gesticulating, claiming that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was down, the fight won, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more he protested the louder they jeered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Then a great shout went up as Kit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sipon got to his feet, his face twisted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain. The partiality of the people infuriated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ingrona, and with a chocking cry he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed at Kitsipon. Crouching, Kitsipon</seg><seg type="columnLine">met his charge, and in the next moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ingrona went flying over his shoulder to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall with a sickening thud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!

Then some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one shouted:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is dead!" The people came surging</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all sides of the ring, only to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed back by the camp-police who came</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding to clear a path for Sounding Sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the medicine men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time Ingrona was like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man dead. When at last he sat up groaning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was seen that his right arm was broken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bone sticking out through the torn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody muscles of his forearm. Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ghost, the shaman, gaunt and hollow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeked, got up from his knees and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing eyes upon Kitsipon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have done a bad thing," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There will be trouble about this thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When my son is well he will settle this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Always you chatter like crow in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">summer time," Sounding Sky's deep voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">interposed.

The voice of the meadow-lark trilled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the women laughed and chattered as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they repaired the damage done to the camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitsipon was eating with his father and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother when he heard the camp-crier call-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his name through the camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The braves of the Horn Society ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitsipon to visit them tonight!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted.

She made cooking pots of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">and earth, and brewed strong medicine</seg><seg type="columnLine">in them. People looked askance at her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and many said that she was a witch. Kit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sipon was sure of it. Under her steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze he had the feeling that she was look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing clean through him. He shifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">position uneasily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will leave the pony and the deer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skins," he said, and moved off with haste.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS HE CROSSED the campus head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the skin-covered tipis of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blackfeet, a scout came riding furiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the camp from the hills and shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his voice: "Sapos!

His cry echoed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">many tongues, and in a moment the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp wras seething with excitement as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people came running from all direct-:</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions, and the camp-crier went galloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">from clan to clan, calling the Scalp Shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men to council. The tremolo of the women</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled the camp as the braves gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the big, council lodge, silent but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with eyes aglow in anticipation of battle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitsipon stood among them, his heart beat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing high; for it w'as soon known that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scout had come upon the trace of Crows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">skulking in the hills. Would his father let</seg><seg type="columnLine">him ride with the war-party? This was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only thought in Kitsipon's head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was not kept in doubt long. Sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Sky came out of the lodge, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the six Scalp Shirt Men. A great shout</seg><seg type="columnLine">went up as the head chief lifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathered staff high above his head. Kit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sipon's eyes sought his father's, silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleading. The old man inclined his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smiled to see his son whirl and dash</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the campus, as light as smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the young braves were eager to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike the Crow, the traditional foe, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">none so eager as Kitsipon.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wild dash for the horses he was among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first who flung themselves upon their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as the sun touched the rim of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills the Dakota braves paraded around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp. Twice they circled it, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sounding Sky lifted his war-lance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a long-drawn "Hie-yah-h-h-h--yeep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yeep!" the Panthers of the Plains dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They rode pell-mell in a cloud of dust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as they neared the hills the mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke up into small parties to scour the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills for sign of the enemy. Kitsipon</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaked away to the south. In his party</seg><seg type="columnLine">were White Dog, a renowned Hunkpapa</seg><seg type="columnLine">brave, Crow Shoe and Thunder Horn. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of hoof geats behind Kitsipon</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked back, and was surprised to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long Ghost riding hard to catch up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Soon the shaman was riding be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They moved down into the ravines and</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the hills. They rode hard, without sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy, until darkness overtook them on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank of a creek that came spilling out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a ravine. Here Thunder Horn, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader, decided to camp for the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitsipon and his companions planted</seg><seg type="columnLine">poles of willow shoots in the ground in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle, covering them with saddle blankets</seg><seg type="columnLine">all around. In the centre of this wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">break they built their fire. They ate a</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal of pemmican in silence, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long Ghost brewed some Paezhuta sapa,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for which he had traded with the Black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, he said. When the others had drunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">he refilled the horn and passed it to Kit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sipon and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My son accepts your gifts.

And because this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his first war-party and he was anxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show his keeness, he was not content</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sit by the fire and keep his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears open while his companions slept, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out to prowl around the windbreak</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a wolf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moon was caught between two</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening clouds, and it was very dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The hobbled horses were moving about</seg><seg type="columnLine">with short jumps as they grazed. Oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casionally one of them sneezed, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started and tightened his grip of the stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his flintlock. A barred owl sent his</seg><seg type="columnLine">booming note into the night from a near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by tree, and another answered him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came to a stand in the darkness.

The quiet of the camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sighing of the wind gave rise to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange feeling of "goneness" that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly to flood his body. He began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiver, and drew his blanket tightly about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Through a slit in the windbreak he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the glow of the fire, and it grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger, then smaller, and then faded into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist. This frightened him. He thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was about to fall asleep. He started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get up, and then fell on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He awoke to all the sudden blackness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night with shouts and shots ringing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears.

Then someone threw water into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face, and he sat up to stare stupidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the furious eyes of Thunder Horn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up woman!" the leader shouted at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kicked him in the ribs as Long Ghost</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Crow Shoe came up to scowl down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Crow have stolen our horses!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thunder Horn raved.

If we do this no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one will blame us, I think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He speaks good words, brother," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crow Shoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thunder Horn sheathed his knife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered a grunt of assent. Then, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long Ghost to help him, he jerked Kit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sipon to his feet. Without waiting for day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light they set out for the camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitsipon sat in his father's lodge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunched up in his blanket, and his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like a cold stone in his breast. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">head was clear now. He knew that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had disgraced himself, his father and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his people. How, or why, this thing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to him he could not tell. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened, and his spirit was dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">within him. When his mother spoke to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked at her with the blank stare of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind man, and made no answer. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp-crier came to call him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">council of the Scalp Shirt Men, he obeyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the summons like a sleep-walker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The people had all gathered before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">council lodge from which the covering had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been rolled back so that the chiefs and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">medicine men sat within a covered half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle in plain view of all. A way was</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened for Kitsipon. He heard voices, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were like whispering. He saw faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they were like shadows. As he came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stand Long Ghost rose to speak. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand came from under his blanket, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his finger pointed at the Hunkpapa chief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was venom in his look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My brothers," he said, "all the chiefs</seg><seg type="columnLine">have spoken about this thing, but Thunder</seg><seg type="columnLine">Face is silent. He sits like rabbit. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbit he says nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down, and the Hunkpapa chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose. "My brothers," the old man said in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a voice that shook, "I am old. Like old</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, that stands in the shade, I stand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow of this thing. Like old horse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head is low. My son stands in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of this thing also. But he is not old.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ask him to lift his head, and hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment of the Scalp Shirt Men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitsipon's head came up with a jerk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He answered clearly and firmly: "Th re</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no fear in my heart, my father. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">too cold to know fear. I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho!" the voice of Long Ghost in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrupted him. "Ho, listen to Nastinchala!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Listen to the Rabbit--" He stopped talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as Sounding Sky jumped to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Always you chatter like crow!" ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed the chief. "Our hearts are sore</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of this thing- that has come upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">our brother. But there is no sorrow in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your heart, I think." He raised his voice so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all the people could hear:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I speak for your chiefs. This trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">has come upon our brother Thunder</seg><seg type="columnLine">Face because his son drew a knife to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed the blood of one of his own people at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this holy time, we think. It will be well</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Kitsipon to leave this camp, lest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger of Wankan Tanka fall upon all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. The Scalp Shirt Men put this ban</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Kitsipon. Let him leave the camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, let him not return to his people un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til twelve moons have passed. Let no man</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him food of comfort while this ban is</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him. I have spoken."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few hours later Kitsipon rode toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hills. He was riding his pack-horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leading his father's war-horse, Flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk. The great steel-dust stallion had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been his father's parting gift, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a faster horse among the Dakota.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His saddle he had made himself, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">it he carried some pemmican, a horn cup</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a war-1&gt;ag containing his dress cloths.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had a four-point, NorVest blanket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a buffalo robe strapped to the cantle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In his belt, on his left side, he carried his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife in a sheath. His other weapons con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted of his flintlock and his quiver con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining his bow and thirty arrows with</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal war-heads that he had made from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old frying pan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rode into the hills. He did not look</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at the camp, but kept going steadily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was the easiest thing to do, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't know where to go. At the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his mind there was the idea that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crows were responsible for his disgrace</seg><seg type="columnLine">and banishment, and that he would avenge</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself by hunting Crow scalps. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove his manhood to himself first, then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">MOCCASI1SED DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would do a great thing-- a brave deed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would be talked of ever}'where. Oh</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes, he would come back to his people a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great warrior. He would throw many Crow</seg><seg type="columnLine">scalps at the feet of Sounding Sky, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daybreak Star's eyes would shine like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars again for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR MANY DAYS he wandered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hills. Like the gray wolf he lurked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the flanks of the moving Crow villages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like a wolf, he ran down the lone hunter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he scorned to spring upon his quarry</seg><seg type="columnLine">from ambush. He challenged all to battle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no brave he encountered withstood</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for long; for he fought with the fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wounded mountain-lion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time the cherries were black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were six Crow scalps dangling from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barrel of his flintlock. Sometimes, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crows sent out war-parties to chase him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but always the steel-dust stallion outran</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fastest ponies. Often they saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night on a butte, silhouetted against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, the long mane and tail of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse flowing like water under the stars;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the steel-blue color of the great stal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion blended so completely with the star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit night that it gave him a ghostly aspect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon the Crows came to thinking that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was an evil spirit, haunting the hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the plains, and they called him Ghost</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horse. They feared him greatly, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">his long-drawn war-cry came echoing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a butte, the Crow braves looked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the ground and dared not answer it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the Moon of Falling Leaves Kitsipon</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the Crow country. He followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">honking geese southward; for soon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">howl of the wolf would echo over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white world of winter, and he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must find some place to winter. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">used up all his powder, and must find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly band with whom he could trade</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pelts for more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Besides, he was lonely and sick at heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At night his father and mother spoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in dreams. Even when awake these</seg><seg type="columnLine">same images appeared to him, and super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">imposed themselves on his surroundings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">veiling them, creating a perpetual mirage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the babbling of a creek he heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter of children around the cooking</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires; the soft eyes of the deer that fell to his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">swift arrows reminded him of Daybreak</seg><seg type="columnLine">Star, and then he felt so bad that a tight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness came into his stomach and he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not eat the flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Day after day he rode, talking to Flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk, his horse. He was sure that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stallion understood him, because he attri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">buted understanding to all creatures; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he could not understand their speech it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only because the power lay dormant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He understood them well enough in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once he crossed the trail of an Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">village, and he knew it was one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dakota clans moving south to winter camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Which of the seven clans that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered for the Sun Dance he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell for sure, but he thought it was Sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Sky's village, because it was a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">village--much bigger that the Hunkpapa,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other clans would be far to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north and east by this time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He followed the trail until it led him</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the wooded foothills, and drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">rein on a high butte. The plain was like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored blanket dropped from the sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tumbleweed rolled along the ground in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ungainly bounds. As far as eye could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing else moved. It was hard not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow the trail until he saw the camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Wankan Tanka saw all things; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to atone for his disgrace, he must not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek out, or look upon the face of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own people for many moons yet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly he rode back into the hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That evening when he was making his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way dowrn a draw to his camp site, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolf came out of the bush and howled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. It was a huge, black timber wolf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with the true curiosity of a wolf it</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched Kitsipon notch an arrow. But at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twang of the sinew-l)acked bow it</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped sideways. The arrow missed its</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and gouged its flank, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelp it vanished into the bush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go now, my brother," said Kitsipon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tomorrow I will follow you. I need</seg><seg type="columnLine">your thick fur for the winter."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Accordingly, at daybreak he loaded his pelts</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the pack-horse and rode out on the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the big wolf. It was easy to follow be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it left a track of blood. It led him</seg><seg type="columnLine">far over the hills and into a valley. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be bent on a steady trail due</seg><seg type="columnLine">south. Not even the fresh cross tracks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">deer swerved it form its purposeful course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">40	INDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">This puzzled Kitsipon because the wolf</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not acting like a hunted thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a pitiless hunter and he kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">on tirelessly. He knew that the wolf was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiring and that if it kept to open country</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would soon run it down. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows of the trees were long when sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly he saw the wolf on a naked ridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho, ho, my brother!" shouted Kitsipon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are tired now. But you are a brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior. You will stand and fight now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LEAVING the pack-horse, he galloped</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the steep slope. But when he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the top he could see no sign of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolf. There was no trace of it. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished like smoke. Slowly he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle the spot where he had seen it last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for a trace of blood. Then his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear, keenly tuned to the voices of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods, caught a strange sound. He dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted and stood listening intently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Faintly on the wind the sound came again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He uttered a grunt of astonishment. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no mistaking what it was. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wail of a child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He jogged down the hill toward a clump</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dense bush and trees whence the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come. Then he saw a red blanket</seg><seg type="columnLine">staked up in a hollow in the bush to form</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crude shelter. Under the blanket an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian woman lay face down on a buffalo</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe. She did not stir as he approached.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dropped to his knees and rolled her</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, and then jumped to his feet as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">something had stung him. It was One</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arrow's woman, Pawnee Captive!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was still breathing but her skin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn tightly over her cheek bones. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned as he bent over her again. Hunger</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at him from out of her glazed eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her lips moved but no sound came. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard the wail again. It seemed to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from above. He looked up and there hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing high out of reach of prowling animals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found the child--a baby not more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">two years old, snug in its woven basket</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed with rabbit skins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly he built a big fire and made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. Then he snared a rabbit; and, slit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing its throat with his knife, pressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm blood into the mouth of the hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">infant. Then he did the same for Pawnee</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captive. Later, he roasted meat on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of a stick and fed it to the woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She ate sparingly, with her strange eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened on his face. Then she asked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the child. He put it into her arms and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without another word, she drew her</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket around it, and sank into a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While she slept he built a large shelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of saplings and covered it with skins. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he worked he thought about the big wolf</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its unswerving track, leading straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Pawnee Captive and her child. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no doubt in his mind as to what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. Near death, Pawnee Captive</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sent her spirit forth in the shape of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wolf to bring help, and he cast uneasy</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances at the sleeping woman. Once he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it would be well to leave all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">food with her and ride away. But curiosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">got the better of his fears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two days passed before Pawnee Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive was able, or willing, to utter more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunts. But on the third day when he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back from a long hunt it was to find his</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal ready for him. While he was eating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pawnee Captive suddenly burst into</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My man, One Arrow, is dead. A big</seg><seg type="columnLine">war-party of Crows attacked our camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many Ogala braves were killed. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big fight. Many Crows died also. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for them. They went away but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they took our horses. Sounding Sky led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people south to capture more horses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We saw no buffalo, and soon the kettles</seg><seg type="columnLine">were empty. I could not keep up. I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitsipon scowled. "It is not the way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Dakota to leave their women to</seg><seg type="columnLine">starve."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am Pawnee," she answered quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Many say I am evil woman. A witch."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitsipon said nothing. After a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause she went on again:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A thing troubles my mind. For two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days I have kept this thing in my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">because it is a bad thing. Now I want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you about this thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How," grunted Kitsipon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This thing will make your heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy but it is so. After the Crow raid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sounding Sky sent scouts to look for your</seg><seg type="columnLine">people to call them to council. They came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but your father's voice was not heard in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the council of the Scalp Shirt Men. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaman, Long Ghost, sat in his place. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hunkpapa have no ears for the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Thunder Face. They have ears only</seg><seg type="columnLine">MOCCASINED DEATH	41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for the words of Long Ghost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing of what he felt showed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitsipon's stern, young face. He stated</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than asked: "Sounding Sky will go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the warpath against the Crows."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho, that is good! The Crows know</seg><seg type="columnLine">me." Then he looked at Pawnee Captive</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked: "Can you travel, woman?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am ready," she answered; then: "In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grona's arm is crooked," she told him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Long Ghost's heart turned bad toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">your father because of this. Now there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">another thing in my heart that I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak. But a time will come when I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">show Kitsipon this thing that is in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE MORNING he made a travois</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the child and they traveled slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">back through the valley. On the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">day they came to the spot where Kitsipon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen the trace of the Ogala village,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for two days they followed the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the swale and roll of the plains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the way they watched closely for war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parties, but saw nothing but the slinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">coyote and the prairie-chickens that flut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered cackling across their path, and once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the distance, a cloud of dust that</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked the passing of a herd of buffalo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the fourth day they saw red hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the skyline, low and bare. Later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could see a line of trees that bordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a river--a dark, green blur lying on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown of the prairie like a snake. Above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees turky-vultures wheeled, and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause they did not settle Kitsipon knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were hovering over the refuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an Indian camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they drew nearer he remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">these hills. Once, long ago, the Hunkpapa</seg><seg type="columnLine">load wintered here in a deep valley beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river. Carry-the-Kettle-Camp, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women had called it because it was three</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffalo arrows from the water. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the blue smoke-haze of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lodge fires he hauled up and said to Paw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nee Captive:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I go no further because of the ban that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is on me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pawnee Captive slid from the pack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, took her child from the travois</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouldered the cradle. Then she came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand before Kitsipon, very straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and very handsome, and there was a soft</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">light in her jet black eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where will you go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitsipon pointed to a spot far up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. "I camp there tonight," he told her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have helped you. Now, you must help</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I will wait until I hear the war drum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I will ride and leave a trail easy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow. My trail will lead to the Crow</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. Tell my father of this thing, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak of it to 110 other man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pawnee Captive laughed softly. "I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is in your mind," she said. "If a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit came to your father in a dream and</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed him the road to the Crow camp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people would think that his medicine</seg><seg type="columnLine">is strong."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitsipon said sternly: "That is not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind, woman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No matter," said she, with a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. "Your father will have a dream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I go to his lodge I will give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">black-coffee-medicine. Oh yes, he will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dream!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitsipon started, struck by a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. "Black-coffee-medicine," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">scowling. "Does it make a man sleep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will do no harm," she said; then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">added quickly: "There is another I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak to. I will speak to her with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's heart. She will wait until Kit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sipon comes back to his people, I think.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If she wants a man bom to be a chief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she will wait" With that she set her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the river, leaving Kitsipon to stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">after her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He watched until she faded into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom of the trees, thinking that one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must have plain speech with her, learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this black-coffee-medicine that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man sleep and dream. Then he rode up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, and made camp in a sandy hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low screened by cottonwoods and willows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was sometime in the dead of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night that he awoke, startled by the howl</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a wolf coming from the opposite bank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The moon had climbed out of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seemed to be entangled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches of the cottonwoods. Back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills he could hear the subdued beat of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">medicine drum. Flying Hawk snorted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamped as the wolf howled again very</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to his camp. He got up and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the hair pricking his scalp, half ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecting to see the flint-eyes of the big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">timber wolf glaring at him from across</seg><seg type="columnLine">42</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INDIAN STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moon struggled out of the cotton-</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods. He moved to the stallion, stroking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his silken neck, soothing him. Across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river he thought he saw a black shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">slink across an open space. Then Flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk jerked up his head and looked in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tently upstream, ears forward. Kitsipon</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked in the direction indicated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A long file of Indians was moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently downstream. They rode with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankets up to their eyes so that only their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagles' feathers showed. The feathers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were red. It was a big Crow war-party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE BACKED Flying Hawk into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep shadows and pinched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nostrils to keep him from whinnying. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a large party for it took a long time</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the file to pass his place of conceal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. The strength of the party told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once that it was bent on the destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Ogala and Hunkpapa before Sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Sky could summon the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dakota clans. As the last of the braves</seg><seg type="columnLine">melted into the shadows, he patted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stallion's neck and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho, ho, this is bad for our people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend! They will not think that the Crows</seg><seg type="columnLine">have followed them so far south. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">good that we saw this thing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moon went behind a cloud, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew darker. But in his mind he carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clear picture of the country--the hill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side flowing down to the river, the thicket</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his left hand that looked like the stiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair on an angry dog's back. He swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto Flying Hawk's back, swam the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then circled the hill in the opposite direct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion to that taken by the Crow war-party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rode slowly and silently for he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Crows would not attack the camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">until an hour before dawn when sleep is</seg><seg type="columnLine">deepest. Soon he found the path the wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had made down to the water, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed it. The throbbing of tomtoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew louder. Presently he saw the flick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering light of a big fire in the valley. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance was in progress, and most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people were gathered in the centre of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. He rode quietly in. No man chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenged him. The Crows might have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same, he thought. He spoke to Flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ho, we will teach them, my friend!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he touched the stallion's belly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his heels, and thundered into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. Straight down upon the dancers</seg><seg type="columnLine">he bore, shouting at the top of his voice:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sapos! Sapos!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment panic swept through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp like fire in the prairie grass. Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced for their weapons; women caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">up their children and ran shrieking on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heels of their men. Sounding Sky's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice rang out above the tumult. Kitsipon</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him standing among a group of elders</seg><seg type="columnLine">and medicine men, with his staff held</seg><seg type="columnLine">above his head to rally the Ogala and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunkpapa around him. He pulled Flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk down to the haunches, wheeled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounded from the saddle and strode up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A chorus of exclamations broke out as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he approached the group. He saw Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ghost's gaunt figure bathed in the flick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering light of the big fire. The shaman</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore the buckskin shirt of a chief, deco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rated with tassles of human hair. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes swept over the group but he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see his father's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How!" he said, and came to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sounding Sky did not return his greet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Instead he lifted his hand, touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips, then his heart and flipped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers twice at Kitsipon, and that said</seg><seg type="columnLine">as plainly as words. "There is a ban upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Stand away from me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitsipon felt the hot blood rush up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his ears. His eyes flashed, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said: "War-chief, while you dance the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crows creep up upon your camp. I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell you this thing. Now you know it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do as you will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He lies!" Long Ghost's voice accused.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We are far from Crow country. He has</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen no Crows. He lies. His heart it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong enough to live out the ban--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Enough!" Sounding Sky raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand in a dignified gesture. The braves</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had dashed for their weapons were</seg><seg type="columnLine">now coming back on the run to form a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight circle around the fire. Sounding Sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for the commotion to die around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. As silence came, he said: "My bro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thers, we have eyes and ears. Let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Auhuminea go out to find the Crow camp."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a rustle of movement as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp-police detached themselves from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">MOCCASINED DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">group and vanished into the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," said Sounding Sky, "let Kitsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pon speak."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitsipon drew himself up proudly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">told how the timber wolf had led him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Pawnee Captive and her child and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wolf had wakened him so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might see the Crow war-party. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished one of the scouts came dashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to report that the Crow camp had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been found down by the river. A tense</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence fell upon the people, and all eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were turned upon Sounding Sky. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time the war-chief stood with folded</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and bent head. At last he spoke:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Brothers, this is my counsel." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to face the river and lifted both</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, holding them crooked as if to grap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple with the enemy. "Let the old men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">women and.children leave the camp. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let the Ogala hide in the woods on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand, and let the Hunkpapa hide in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woods on my left hand. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crows come they will think that we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep in our lodges. They will rush into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp to kill us. Then--" he paused,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking around at the tense faces of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">braves, then brought his hands together</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a resounding clap. "Then, my bro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thers, we will catch them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Agh, agh-good, very good!" Shout9</seg><seg type="columnLine">of approval broke out all around him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again Kitsipon looked for his father's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face among the Hunkpapa braves who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gathered around Long Ghost, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not find it. His gaze came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">focus on Long Ghost.' Their eyes met,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the shaman's look was like the glinc</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a knife blade in the moonlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SWIFTLY the camp-police executed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders. The old men, women and chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren were herded together. Then Kitsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pon saw his father moving off with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old men. The shame of it struck at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">like fangs. His eyes darted to Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ghost, who was leading the Hunkpapa</seg><seg type="columnLine">braves to the left side of the valley. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his father's right to lead the Hunk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">papa, and he saw the shaman through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a red haze of sudden hate. His hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew to the hilt of his knife. But even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his leg muscles tightened for a spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand of Sounding Sky fell upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and spun him around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now is not the time!" said the chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitsipon threw off his hand, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing. Hot words rose shaped in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, but he did not utter them. Sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Sky's gaze was calm, serene. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief said in a low voice that soothed:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My heart is sore for my brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thunder Face. Long Ghost has much</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth but poor counsel. Yet it is for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunkpapa to say who they will send to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the council of the Scalp Shirt Men. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the way of the Dakota. Has the son</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Thunder Face forgotten this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In my anger I forgot it," said Kitsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pon. "But my anger is dead now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chief lowered his voice. "Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will tell you this: Pawnee Captive came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my lodge and told me a thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubles my mind. I do not know about</seg><seg type="columnLine">this thing but Long Ghost knows about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. In council I will ask him about this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. More I cannot tell now." He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at the stars, then:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Crows will come soon. Let Kitsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pon fight with the Ogala, so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have no trouble with Long Ghost."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And with that he turned away and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to join his braves, already in ambush</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the wooded slope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time passed very slowly, and it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Kitsipon that he had been crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside Sounding Sky for many hours, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was still no sign of the Crow. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dakotas' horses had been left to graze,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the better to deceive the enemy, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered if the Crows would know Fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Hawk when they ran them off. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him the Ogala braves lay on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bellies, stripped to their breech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloths, their painted bodies covering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal of their guns. The night was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for the spirited chirping of a tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">frog. The big fire in the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp blinked like a sleepy, red eye and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew smaller and smaller. The moon sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the hills. The stars paled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly a l&gt;arred owl sent its</seg><seg type="columnLine">booming note into the night and was an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered by another like an echo. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a rustle of movement in the bush</seg><seg type="columnLine">all around Kitsipon as the Ogala braves</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose to a crouching position. The owl</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooted again, and then the shrill Crow</seg><seg type="columnLine">war-cry reverberated through the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like wolves upon a fallen deer they</seg><seg type="columnLine">swooped into the camp. They came on</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot, howling and shooting their guns into</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Dakota tipis; then slashed their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">into them with their knives, expecting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise and kill the occupants before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could grasp their weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It did not take them long to discover</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had been tricked, and they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing out of the tipis to gather around</seg><seg type="columnLine">their chief, yapping like dogs around an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old woman with meat. Before they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to recover from the shock of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sounding Sky gave tongue to the Dakota</seg><seg type="columnLine">war-cry:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hie-yah-h-h-h--veep, veep!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the signal to shoot. The black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness on both sides of the Crows was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent by gun-flashes. As the echoes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ragged volley went rolling up the valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Dakota threw down their guns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched tomahawk and knife from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">belts, and rushed down upon the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused Crows, the long-drawn war-cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">trailing behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment Kitsipon found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the Crows, cutting and slashing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two braves went down before him. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blow from a gun butt stunned him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dropped to his knees, and the fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">surged over and all around him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he struggled to his feet he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these Crows were not women. Many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them had fallen to the Dakotas' guns, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many more had been slashed to death in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first savage attack. But they had beaten off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attack and now they were gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">around their chief, chanting their death</seg><seg type="columnLine">songs, prepared to die with their faces to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy. They were outnumbered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemmed in on all sides, but they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">their guns; and, even as Kitsipon looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around for Sounding Sky, they started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot. A brave, standing close to Kitsipon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coughed and fell on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UNDER the menace of their guns the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dakota wavered. Many thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own guns which they had dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bush, and ran to get them. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinned the circle about the trapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crows, and their chief was quick to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chance this gave them to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">through to their horses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sapos--hokdu hoka!" his voice rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">out above the thudding of the guns. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the next minute he came bounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight at Kitsipon, and the Crows came</seg><seg type="columnLine">howling on his heels. The suddeness of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the onslaught took the Dakotas by sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise. They broke to right and left, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitsipon found himself alone, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the path of the Crow chief. He stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ground--he had never shown his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a Crow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a mountain-lion the Crow chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">came at him, swinging his tomahawk. Kit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sipon ducked the stroke and sank his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife into the Crow's body; and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">they went down together, locked in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">death struggle, rolling over and over on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground while the Crow charge swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">over them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Crow chief was strong, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought like a wounded wolverine. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">his strength was fast ebbing from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound. He gasped as Kitsipon's knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">found his body again. Bravely he strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled to his knees and died as Kitsipon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife plunged into his throat. Deftly Kit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sipon took his scalp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he got to his feet there was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man in sight, but far down the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could hear the Dakotas howling like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wolf pack on the heels of the fleeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crows. He started to run. Then a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot came so close that the flash blinded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and the bullet, grazing his left shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, spun him around and dropped him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his knees. Before he could regain his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, Long Ghost came leaping from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind a tipi. The shaman swung his gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">above his head. Kitsipon flung himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideways. The gun butt thudded on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground close to his head. He bounded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet, and kicked the gun from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaman's hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long Ghost backed away slowly, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face distorted by fear and hate. His small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glinting eyes reminded Kitsipon of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horned desert snake that strikes without</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiling, and suddenly he thought of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black-medicine-coffee he'd drunk on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first war-party and knew what had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaped forward and plunged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife into the shaman's left breast. Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ghost gasped once and died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down by the river the Crows made</seg><seg type="columnLine">their last stand. And there they died</seg><seg type="columnLine">like men--all but a boy who was spared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sent back to his people to tell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story of the fight. Many of the Ogala</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Hunkpapa braves had gone on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ride also, and soon the voice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">MOCCASINED DEATH	45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Miteywin was sobbing1 across the prairie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the mourning was not long; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were many Crow scalps to ran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">som the dead.

It was a beautiful thing, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of Pawnee Captive and Daybreak</seg><seg type="columnLine">Star.

From</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time, the canyons and ridges of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Smokies had been the home of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gierokee.

For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time, he stood there, watching it</seg><seg type="columnLine">move, slow and inevitable, driving deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the heart of his land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUN was low in the pines and</seg><seg type="columnLine">red with the last warmth of day, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the mountain meadows a cold night</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind was rising.

Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had heard the songs of his mother and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yarns spun by old warriors at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">council fires. In the fields of Ocona Luftee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had danced the Green Corn Dance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked with his father to see the stalks</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach high and good to the sun. He had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF KUWAHI	51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed and courted the maidens who</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled softly and wore the neckerchiefs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of young braves as a token of their favor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in the shadow of Kuwalhi Peak, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dreamed of a bride and sons and ly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, one day, old in years and honor, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fathers in the Cherokee burying</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the wind still cried with the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ewen Gentry and* Ruhaya halted a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in the still, twilit wood.

Perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind said, Perhaps fihere could be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new life for the Cherokee; an end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flood-tide of whites who stole everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a smile or a crooked word--or a gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ruhaya made a raw sound in his throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lunged on through the tangled brush.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He didn't stop until he reached the cove</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his father's farm, saw the patient, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuring rows of the field; the lighted win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows and the shadow of Tsahuni moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow and steady about the cabin. Ruhaya</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a chill sweat on his back. His bruised</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw ached dully.

Lines of thought and laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">scored the darjs; face and his eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep with the gentle knowledge of long</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of peace, yet still bright and quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took a step toward the door.

Ruhaya</seg><seg type="columnLine">froze, leg-muscles taut, poised on w'ideset</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. He swung his head to one side, lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tening, not breathing. The low whimper</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came again, nearer now. Tt wasn't the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry of an animal. Ruhaya's hand lifted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunting knife at his belt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It happened fast. Fingers closed on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankle like the jaw's of a sprung beartrap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arms reached up from the dark and twis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted violently. Ruhaya's knees buckled. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground came up hard; briar tore at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest and then a weight was on him, naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinew and muscle driving him back against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His clawed hand found a shoulder; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin was hot and sticky to the touch. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist drove for his head. Ruhaya caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist and wrenched sideward. The shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">above him screamed out of pain and rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear. Ruhaya was on top, then; the knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">was free of its doghide sheath. His knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinned the writhing arms. He lifted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long blade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will not go! Kill me, but I will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The knife didn't fall. The shrill, hys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terical voice stopped it--the voice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in Cherokee dialect. And now, close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, Ruhaya saw the warped, shadowy</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the Indian; the face of Norn, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother of his Chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wild words still tumbled from the bleed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mouth; the head rolled from side to</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Norn had been shot through the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest. His breathing had a shallow, wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound; as if a lung had been torn. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lost a great deal of blood. The hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">stickiness matted the hair of his torso.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lurched ciazily, trying to be free of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruhaya.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Norn!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The glassy eyes stared.

The scream died.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The struggling stopped. In the dark thic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ket, the only sound was the rasp of Norn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing. Slowly the eyes focussed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Norn. It is I.

Ruhaya's head had lifted. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">nostrils quivered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn lay silent now. Ruhaya heard it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slow careful crunch of boots on brush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ruhaya's face turned slightly, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, expressionless, waiting. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see through the thicket-maze now; see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky lighter behind the trees, the faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">needlepoints of stars. He crouched low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing the raw sound of Norn's breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. It was too loud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tread of boots hesitated, then came</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. Ruhaya's leg-muscles drew tight. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow loomed out of deq&gt;er shadow; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure moved, tall and wary, taut fists hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing an Army rifle at the ready. The sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dier was only a few yards from the thicket</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Norn coughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WETNESS choked in his throat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn up from deep in his chest. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier swore and wheeled and the gun</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted crazily. He fired blind. The yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame stabbed over Ruhaya's head as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed in low, dug a shoulder into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue cloth and slammed the trooper to</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frantic hands tried to bring the rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">butt down across Ruhaya's jaw. Ruhaya</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove a backhand under the ear. The sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dier made one more try. The bayonet</seg><seg type="columnLine">raked the Cherokee's thigh and then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got in the second blow, neat and sharp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the base of the skull. The trooper folded</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a briar clump and lay still, breathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow and heavy, like a man asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ruhaya lurched to his feet. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw-wound ached. Pain shot up his leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">with each bend of the knee. He got back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Norn. The Indian lay crumpled forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the thicket; there was blood on his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes had glazed again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My father," Ruhaya said. "My father</seg><seg type="columnLine">is alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn stared. Ruhaya slung the Indian's</seg><seg type="columnLine">right arm across his own shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hefted him. Norn could walk.

Weaselpits caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Norn's watery legs. Twice, he fell. Get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting him up again was like shouldering a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet log. Blood made long stripes down his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest; it glistened in the pale moonlight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They struck clear of the trees and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fields of corn and then Ruhaya pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up short.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't see anything at first. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a difference, a stir in the peaceable still-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of his father's land. He heard a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">chink of metal, then a razoredged tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">that spilled out the words of the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Norn looked at him, liis eyes normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have come. Already they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">come this far."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn swore to his gods in a low voice;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he started toward the distant hulk of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin.

He went at a low run,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loping as the fox lopes, soundless, bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the cabin from the rear. He flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened against the logwall; bark scraped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spine; it was an effort to keep his breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing quiet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made the corner just as the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Army men came through the lighted door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Tsahuni moved between them, tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thin and proud. Once, he stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have spoken. One of the troopers</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him a shove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, old man. Walk when I tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Walk!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second shove was harder.

His mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted and a hand closed on his knife-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilt. He took one step. A cool circle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal pressed his spine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it ain't the bright boy.

Drop the knife."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ruhaya dropped it. He knew the voice;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew the square fists that held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle trained on him, the heavy blond face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small axe and leaded quirt looped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the belt. Van Tilgh was beside him, now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nudging the muzzle against his ribs, smil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He could smell whiskey on the min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er's breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, question-asker. Join your</seg><seg type="columnLine">brave father."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tsahuni had regained his feet. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">old and tired; his eyes were flint-cold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruhaya did not meet his stare. Moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward into the light Ruhaya watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers, the glint of long gunbarrels lev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">elled on his father's chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Van Tilgh laughed at the Army men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't know about this one, did you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Real smart, this one.

One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of- the soldiers shouted, "Look out!" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Van Tilgh whirled, pulling the rifle into</seg><seg type="columnLine">play. Norn came in fast, lurching wildly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and screaming, his blood very red in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light from the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't have a chance. He was half-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">blind. His legs buckled as Van Tilgh drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal butt sidewise under his jaw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn went down in a manlong billow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust. The scream came out of agony now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Van Tilgh towered over him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another one," he grated. "Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright boy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His heavy boot hauled back.

No more of that."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Van Tilgh frowned. His bull neck was</seg><seg type="columnLine">red and swollen, but he didn't let go the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kick.

"Help</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RUHAYA went to Norn's side.

Better to move ahead of the tide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man did not speak. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was weary and expressionless, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still a question behind his mask.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if we go? he seemed to ask. Will</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tide ever end? Will the floods ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave us alone?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Van Tilgh took the lead. Half-carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn between them, Ruhaya and his fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther followed. The troopers brought up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear.

Once he coughed and a thin red</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream ran from his mouth.

Ruhaya looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the straggling line of silent Cherokee</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces; braves stared back dully like men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a dream. Squaws held babies close in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their shawls and the children clung in</seg><seg type="columnLine">little knots, wide-eyed, watching the slow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pacing soldiers who patrolled the length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the column.

There were not many soldiers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the rifles they gripped in tight fists</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave them the strength of many. Ruhaya</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tsahuni fell in at the end of the line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few of the Cherokees turned to stare at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood matted on Norn's chest.

In the end, without a word, Ru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haya took a stronger grip on the limp body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Norn. They walked. They followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, oxenlike line of Cherokee prisoners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ahead, the hills pitched steep to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass-floor; the ledge trail twisted through</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry washes and matted brush. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no talking now; there was only the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the crags high above them, w-ailing like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a squaw in mourning; the wind and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffle of aimless feet and the frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimper of a Cherokee baby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, between them, Norn stirred. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">head lifted; his eyes cleared for a second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">widened with sudden realization. Ruhaya</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the battered form stiffen, felt the cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">rip up from the lungs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No! We will not go! We will stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hills of Kuwahi!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ruhaya and the old one tried to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. It was no good. A last surge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">power that was more than human tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">him free of their grappling fingers. Norn</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed and spun on Van Tilgh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hear this! Hear the word of Sedotee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my brother, Chief of the Cherokee! We</seg><seg type="columnLine">will stay!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indians halted and turned to stare. Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the spearhead a dark figure wheeled;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Captain swore and started down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line on the double. He didn't get there</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn went in wild and blind and Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tilgh did not even stop smiling. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped to one side, clear of the clutching</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists; the leaded quirt flicked up in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">free hand, lifted and sliced down, vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciously, just as Norn lunged past. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE EAGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">full force of it slammed across the bleed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden growl ran through the Chero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Captain yelled, "Van Tilgh, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn had stopped dead. His legs folded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he went to his knees, teetering that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way for a moment. The hemorrhage came</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he toppled forward, a bright red river</seg><seg type="columnLine">spilling from nose and mouth, soaking into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon white shale. Even after he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">quit breathing, the blood kept coming. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">troopers stared. Van Tilgh swore hoarsely</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took a step toward the broken form.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hobnail boot swung back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was when Ruhaya charged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pent-up rage ripped the 'Cherokee war</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry from his throat. The scream crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like chain-lightning in the mountains of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kuwahi, echoing from mouth to mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even as he moved in, Ruhaya saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surge of motion all down the line, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel and lunge of bronze bodies. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers stagger back, pulling their guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, and heard the young officer shrill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Cover! Take Cover!" Only it was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late for military orders. Panicked troopers</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired blind into the mob. An old warrior</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched at his shoulder and pitched for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. Squaws screamed, shielding children</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their bodies. The Indians kept charg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ruhaya didn't see the rest. AH he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">then was Van Tilgh's square face close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his, the bared teeth and bloodshot eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the straining tendons of the bullneck. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms locked with Van Tilgh's; he caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrist of the gunhand, wrenched it</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and up. Van Tilgh bellowed and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers splayed, letting the rifle clatter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. Ruhaya kicked it clear. His fist col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lared Van Tilgh, twisting the homespun</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirtfront; his free hand lifted and ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered down into the warped face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He kept hitting; beating his knuckles</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the broken nose, the split, bleeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. Van Tilgh's fingers clawed at him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge body heaved and a bony knee</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove high into Ruhaya's groin. His grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke. His eyes blurred and he went back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbling, off-keel. He fell and then Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tilgh was on his feet, laughing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bloody mouth, grabbing at the fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle and pumping the lever, swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muzzle full on Ruhaya's face. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF KUWAHI	57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cherokee rolled to one side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the shot did not come. All along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bench, cries lifted and guns spurted</seg><seg type="columnLine">red needles into the night, but Van Tilgh</seg><seg type="columnLine">never pulled the trigger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ruhaya saw his father come in low</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the side, saw Van Tilgh try to spin</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the last minute and the way Tsahuni</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened to his full, lean height. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cherokee knife went up and down, up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down again, burying itself hilt-deep in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white throat. Van Tilgh fell where he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, not far from the body of Norn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not move again. The rifle was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand. His blood drained into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandy shale, mingling slowly with the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Norn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was over then. There were Cherokee</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded. An old man's squaw nursed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn muscles of his upper arm; a brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat quiet, his teeth set against the pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a shell-shattered knee. But a handful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers hadn't stood long against the turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ruhaya straightened, sweating and</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing heavily, staring down the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ramp of the hill. Cherokees held the rifles</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. They stood silent, watching the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush below them, the pale ribbons of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass-floor that trailed off toward the stock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ade. Once, briefly, a knot of blue-coated</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures slithered into view, moving fast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like cottontails with a hound-dog on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A gnarled bony hand touched Ruhaya's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. He turned and stared at his father.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time he did not look away. After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment they locked arms, hand to wrist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripping tight and warm. Tsahuni said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My son." And there was quiet pride in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saying of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Cherokees came along the bench</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a gathering crowd to the spot where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tsahuni stood beside his son.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The women did not speak; the braves</seg><seg type="columnLine">were silent, but a question was in the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that watched Ruhaya and his father stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily, the eyes of men who waited to be led.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruhaya looked at his father. The old one</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded. Ruhaya turned then to the wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing faces of his people. And his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was deep and strong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are Cherokees. This is the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our fathers. It is our land."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Indians murmured and drew closer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer dull-eyed and expressionless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">58</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will go unto the hills, high above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forests -of Ocora Luftee, even to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest peak of Kuwahi.

A night and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day and a night of waiting.

The open mouth of the cove</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced North and, from a broad slab of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jutting stone they could see the restless</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinpoint fires of the stockade far down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Ocona Luftee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They did not build fires that night. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not eat. The old men curled in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankets and the women sang ancient songs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of peace to hungry, weary children. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slept and, on the lookout stone, Cherokee</seg><seg type="columnLine">braves lay belly-flat, silent, watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley. Unsleeping, Tsahuni squatted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed legs; his eyes did not leave the fort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At his side, Ruhaya stood tall against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting moon, gripping the metal and wood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an Army rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun rose and a party of hunters</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged warily down into the high timber.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The camp ate wild rabbit and drank root</seg><seg type="columnLine">tea and, before noon, the sentries on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock saw the start of the westward re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> .Ruhaya stood silent and watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue-coated ants scurry across the parade</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fort, saw the long column of cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured Cherokees march out through wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung gates, slow and tired, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted soldiers who trotted up and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">harrying the line as a sheepdog worries the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sentries of the rock muttered In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dian curses.

Sitting quiet, Tsahuni studied their</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces; he saw the high lean shadow of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">son against the bright sky, poised and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready. The Eagle of Kuwahi nodded. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was content.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The change came in the evening of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second day. The Cherokee prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">were long gone toward the dying sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the dusk now the stockade lay sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly lifeless. The uniformed ants no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer *ran from hut to hut. No echo of</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy shouting sifted up through the pass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was too quiet. Tsahuni looked at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and Ruhaya said, "They hold council</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. This night they decide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Cherokee camp was silent. Women</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat by tiny shielded fires and children for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to play. Softly, an old warrior mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the war chants of his fathers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young braves moved like shadows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">freeing their knives, checking the cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers of the few guns they had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the darkness before moonrise, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay still at the cove-mouth; dark eyes raked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long drop of the mountain-face; taut</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles ached. Soundlessly, Ruhaya paced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rock, passing a reassuring word from</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE EAGLE OF KUWAHI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">59</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man to man. Once, far oft', a cat screeched</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the stripling brave leaped up, cocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Patience," Ruhaya murmured. "Pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tience, young one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The boy settled down. Tsahuni sat at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">post, a motionless part of the rock; only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old eyes moved and narrowed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched. Slowly the moon came up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ruhaya heard the noise first. His spine</seg><seg type="columnLine">went ramrod-stiff; the hair at the base of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his skull felt tight.

No one spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Behind them, in the cove, a child</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to cry almost without sound. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise came again, light and nearly lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the soughing of night wind--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snap and whish of bramble underfoot. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the right, just below the sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinel rock, in the black maw of the timber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ruhaya's gaze .swung to a sudden shiver</seg><seg type="columnLine">of leaves and brush. A brave rolled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet; a rifle glinted and arched up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing bead on the tall figure that broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear of the pines and stood unshielded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bright moonlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruhaya said, "Hold!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The command cut across dark stillness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Cherokee froze; slowly the gun-bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rel lowered. Old Tsahuni did not move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither did Ruhaya. His black stare was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed on the figure in the clearing, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lank arms and torso clad in buckskin, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leggins of fringed hide, the long, sharp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planed mask of Ewen Gentry's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gentry was not carrying a rifle. De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberately, as they watched, he unhitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shell-belt at his hips, the holster and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheathed knife. He let them fall at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, and stood silent, unarmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ruhaya's expression did not change.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He flicked a glance at Tsahuni.

Just as the first evidences of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn streaked the eastern sky in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, Lee reined-up his horse at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of Hell's Basin, a natural valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which the Trail cut.

Weaving as if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were drugged, the first Indians appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the bend in the canyon. Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foot warriors were dancing. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectacle was like a fantastic nightmare</seg><seg type="columnLine">that left the waiting troopers with a cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling at the base of their skulls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You haven't seen anything like this</seg><seg type="columnLine">since Powder River. Those Cheyenne have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone crazy. They'll come through this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. You can't hold them back. Too bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Regiment didn't get here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lee gripped the stock of his carbine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocked back the hammer. The Cheyenne</seg><seg type="columnLine">were perfectly quiet now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun was up high in the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the purple shadows which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the canyon earlier that morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now gone. Where the air had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool, it was hot and damp, and the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere was weighted with the feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of impending action. The only sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">which arose from East Canyon were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">groanings of the Indians who had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded in the first charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Death Drums were silenced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, so suddenly that even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching cavalrymen were startled, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great cry went up from the Indian band,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they began moving their horses for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward at a trot, picking up speed as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. A few troopers opened fire with</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly, persistent shots, but the Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">came 011.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now they approached the positions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cavalrymen and their voices lifted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cry of defiance which sounded down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of the canyon. The shooting started</seg><seg type="columnLine">again in earnest--the even, precise volleys</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the soldier's carbines against the scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered replies of the Indian muskets. Lee</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded and fired. Cheyenne braves rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their ponies. In the blinding dust he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw an Indian brave ride up to a cavalry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, pull him from behind a rock, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain him with a war club. Lee fired at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the painted brave, but lost him in the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion. Indians fell from their mounts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were trampled by those thundering</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them. The Cheyenne were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What's the use? You can't stop them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A couple of thousand red sticks down</seg><seg type="columnLine">there against a hand full of troopers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're lucky they don't take time out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill every calvalryman around here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mounted Indians were past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers now, followed by those on foot--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the squaws and the old. The volleys of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carbines took great chunks out of the In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dian ranks which were quickly refilled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">other Cheyenne pressing in from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear. The slaughter was simply immense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the women and children went past,</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming, shooting like their men, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing from the Spencer carbines along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls of the canyon automatically died</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. The great parade of screaming In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dians continued past for several minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and toward the end, as the cavalrymen</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized the futility of the killing, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no shooting at all from their Spencer</seg><seg type="columnLine">carbines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Let them come on. You can't stop them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come on! Come on!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The screaming tribesmen were down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon beyond the cavalrymen's positions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was quiet again. The Regiment had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived, and the Cheyenne tribe was es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caping to the south to join their brothers</seg><seg type="columnLine">BRIDE OF THE TOMAHAWK PACK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">path against the Colorado</seg><seg type="columnLine">station force had failed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the war</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlers.

Below him Sanchez was moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the troopers checking on injuries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sun had become unbearibly hot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lee felt a vague resentment against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Regiment for not arriving in time. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered the nausea of the soldier defeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in battle--the feeling of a child who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">misplaced a toy, or a husband who dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covers an unfaithful wife. He was sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly sick of the whole unpleasantness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It all happened again very quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the other end of the canyon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian muskets began firing anew; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Major across the canylon began shouting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the troopers were nervously loading</seg><seg type="columnLine">their carbines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lt.

All the fight was gone now</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Indians. They allowed themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be driven before the wall of cavalrymen</seg><seg type="columnLine">like whipped dogs. Lee saw a trooper</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride up to a fat squaw who was attempting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hide behind a rock, spank her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flat of his blade, and drive her back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the retreating herd.

American Dog lifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand feebly. He had been shot in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach and clamped a stick in his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep his teeth from chattering. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">braves helped to hold him, and removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stick so he could speak. Behind him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cavalry troopers waited uneasily, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressions of guilt written on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Crazy Dogs chant that the coat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">of-blue has slain Little Bear, the war chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Cheyenne.
