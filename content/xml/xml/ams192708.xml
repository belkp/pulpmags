It  </p><p> seems to me that there is a great need, a crying demand, for just  </p><p> such a magazine.”*  </p><p> T EST is be thought that only the fair sex has taken to the idea  </p><p> behind Modern Story, we hasten to quote from a chap in  </p><p> Chicago: “It indeed was a fortunate circumstance which led me  </p><p> to the newsstand where I got my first copy of Modern Story Maga¬  </p><p> zine. I had started out looking for a copy of another magazine  </p><p> when I chanced to see yours on the counter. Attracted by the  </p><p> title and the elegant style of the cover, I picked up a copy, opened  </p><p> it and saw that I had found the ore thing I long had desired to  </p><p> see: a magazine devoted entirely to the interests of modern youth.”*  </p><p> y^/HAT is it about this new magazine that has so captured the  </p><p> imagination of modern youth? It must be fresh and differ¬  </p><p> ent; it must offer them something that no other publication does.  </p><p> Nothing else will explain the enthusiasm aroused by its appear¬  </p><p> ance, and its steadily mounting circulation.  </p><p> pERHAPS you, too, have been looking for just such a maga¬  </p><p> zine, but have not known that it exists.

Y.</p><p>Extravagant Fiction Today......- Cold Fact Tomorrow </p><p>A DIFFERENT STORY </p><p>By HUGO GERNSBACK </p><p>OW that Amazing Stories has put the </p><p>first year safely behind it, it is safe to </p><p>say that the magazine has definitely “ar- </p><p>rived.” Much work, however, is still </p><p>left to be done. I wish to say here how </p><p>much we all appreciate the continued support of our </p><p>readers and their enthusiasm in supporting the mag- </p><p>azine month after month. </p><p> While the experimental period is over, and the ma-</p><p>gazine is on a fair road to success, much ground has </p><p>yet to be covered. For one thing, the magazine is </p><p>not yet on a paying basis, notwithstanding the fact </p><p>that 150,000 copies are printed monthly. The ex- </p><p>pense of publishing and distributing the magazine </p><p>and placing it on some 30,000 newsstands through- </p><p>out the country is enormous. On the other hand, it </p><p>takes several years to establish a magazine with the </p><p>advertisers, and while Amazing Stories now en- </p><p>joys the confidence of a few advertisers, much re- </p><p>mains to be done. Not until the magazine has some </p><p>twenty or thirty pages of advertising will it be pos- </p><p>sible to realize a profit on the publication. </p><p> T believe you will appreciate a frank talk of this</p><p>kind, for the simple reason that after all it is really </p><p>your magazine, and is published at the present time </p><p>more for your benefit than for the benefit of the </p><p>publishers. It is with this thought in mind that I </p><p>feel I am not expecting too much when 1 ask that </p><p>you sign the blank helow, giving us the names and </p><p>addresses of as many of your friends as you think </p><p>might be interested in Amazing Stories. </p><p> Only by having additional readers can the maga-</p><p>zine hope lo be put on a profitable basis. When we </p><p>print 150,000 magazines, that does not mean that </p><p>150,000 are sold. The publishers put out their ma- </p><p>gazines on the newsstands, and only those that are</p><p>sold are paid for. Those that are not sold are re- </p><p>turned for crcdit. It is my idea, then, to send these </p><p>returned copies to your friends so that those who </p><p>have never seen the magazine may become acquaint- </p><p>ed with it and become steady readers. We believe </p><p>this is a small favor to ask, and of course, we would </p><p>like to have only the names of such of your friends </p><p>as have never seen the magazine before, and who, </p><p>you think, might be interested in Amazing Stories. </p><p> After all, we are doing pioneer work with an en-</p><p>tirely new and different kind of magazine, and must, </p><p>therefore, have whatever assistance you can give us </p><p>by sending us good prospects and then let the mag- </p><p>azine succeed on its own merits. If you do not wish </p><p>to mutilate the magazine, just copy the blank and </p><p>send it to us properly filled in. A copy of the maga- </p><p>zine will then be sent free, to your friends. </p><p>.

With infi- </p><p>nite complacency men went to and fro over this </p><p>globe about their little affairs, serene in their assur- </p><p>ance of their empire over matter. It is possible </p><p>that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. </p><p>No one ga%’e a thought to the older worlds of space </p><p>as sources of human danger, or thought of them </p><p>only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as im- </p><p>possible or improbable. It is curious to recall some </p><p>of the mental habits of those departed days. At </p><p>most, terrestrial men fancied there might be other </p><p>men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and </p><p>ready to welcome a mis- </p><p>sionary enterprise. Yet, </p><p>across the gulf of space, </p><p>minds that are to our </p><p>minds as ours are to those </p><p>of the beasts that perish, </p><p>intellects vast and cool </p><p>and unsympathetic, re- </p><p>garded this earth with </p><p>envious eyes, and slowly </p><p>and surely drew their </p><p>plans against us. And </p><p>early &lt;n the twentieth </p><p>century came the great </p><p>disillusionment. </p><p> The planet Mars, I</p><p>scarcely need remind the </p><p>reader, revolves about the </p><p>sun at a mean distance of </p><p>140,000.000 miles, and the </p><p>light and heat it receives </p><p>from the sun is less than </p><p>half of that received by </p><p>this world. It must be, </p><p>if the nebular hypothesis </p><p>has any truth, older than ___________ </p><p>our world, and long before</p><p>this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface </p><p>must have begun its course. The fact that it is </p><p>scarcely one-seventh of t he volume of the earth must </p><p>have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at </p><p>which life could begin. It has air and water, and all </p><p>that is necessary for the support of animated exist- </p><p>ence. </p><p> Yet so vain is man. and so blinded by his vanity,</p><p>that no writer, up to the very end of the nineteenth </p><p>century, expressed any idea that intelligent life </p><p>might have developed there far beyond its earthly </p><p>level, or indeed at all. Nor was it generally under- </p><p>stood that since Mars is older than our earth, with </p><p>scarcely a quarter of the superficial area, and re- </p><p>moter from the sun, it necessarily follows that it is </p><p>not only more distant from life’s beginning but </p><p>nearer its end. </p><p> The secular cooling that must some day overtake</p><p>our planet has already gone far indeed with our </p><p>neighbor. Its physical condition is still largely a </p><p>mystery, but we know now that even in its equa- </p><p>torial region the midday temperature barely ap- </p><p>proaches that of our coldest winter. Its air is much </p><p>more attenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk </p><p>until they cover but a third of its surface, and as its </p><p>slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt </p><p>about either pole, and periodically inundate its tem- </p><p>perate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which </p><p>to us is still incredibly remote, has become a pres- </p><p>ent-day problem for the inhabitants of Mars. The </p><p>immediate pressure of necessity has brightened </p><p>their intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened </p><p>their hearts. And looking across space, with instru- </p><p>ments and intelligences such as we have scarcely </p><p>dreamt of, they see, at its nearest distance, only </p><p>35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, a morning </p><p>star of hope, our own warmer planet green with </p><p>vegetation and gray with water, with a cloudy at- </p><p>mosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses </p><p>through its drifting cloud-wisps of broad stretches </p><p>of populous country and </p><p>navy-crowded </p><p> f~\F all the stories that H. G. Wells wrote, perhaps</p><p> none has become so justly famous as "The War of</p><p> the Worlds." In this classic, one of the first great Mar-</p><p> tian stories, the Martians make war upon our world with</p><p> far-reacliing consequences. In it, Wells makes the point</p><p> that the actual Martian does not remotely resemble a hu-</p><p> man being. This is excellent science, because after all</p><p> there is hardly a chance in a million that in the evolution</p><p> of Mars their intelligent beings should even suggest the</p><p> human race. Evolutionists today agree that the human</p><p> race, in being endowed with its intelligence, was, after</p><p> all, only a biological accident. There is no reason why</p><p> insects or some other species could not just as well be</p><p> the rulers of some planet.</p><p> Wells has often been condemned because of his pic-</p><p> tured ruthlessness of Martians, but, after all. why should</p><p> they not be ruthlessf Are we not ourselves as ruthless</p><p> when we dissect insects and low animals for our scien-</p><p> tific investigations? If there were a superior intelligence,</p><p> to which, by comparison, ours was as inferior as that of</p><p> a chicken compared to a man’s, there would be no good</p><p> reason why it should not be ruthless if it wanted to con-</p><p> quer the planet for its orvn designs. We humans our-</p><p> selves would not hesitate to do the same thing if we sent</p><p> an expedition, let us say. to the moon, if we found what</p><p> we considered a low species there.</p><p> In any event, the " War of the Worlds” is a tremendous</p><p> document that will remain a classic for centuries to come.</p><p>narrow </p><p>seas. </p><p> And we men, the crea-</p><p>tures who inhabit this </p><p>earth, must be to them at </p><p>least as alien and lowly </p><p>as are the monkeys and </p><p>lemurs to us. The intel- </p><p>lectual side of man al- </p><p>ready admits that life is </p><p>an incessant struggle for </p><p>existence, and it would </p><p>seem that this too is the </p><p>belief of the minds upon </p><p>Mars. Their world is far </p><p>gone in its cooling, and </p><p>this world is still crowded </p><p>with life, but crowded </p><p>only with what they re- </p><p>gard as inferior animals. </p><p>To carry warfare sun- </p><p>ward is indeed their only </p><p>escape from the destruc- </p><p>tion that generation after </p><p>generation creeps upon </p><p>them. </p><p> And before we judge of them too harshly, we</p><p>must remember what ruthless and utter destruction </p><p>our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, </p><p>such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon </p><p>its own inferior races. The Tasmanians, in spite </p><p>of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of </p><p>existence in a war of extermination waged by Euro- </p><p>pean immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are </p><p>we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the</p><p>Martians warred in the same spirit? </p><p> The Martians seem to have calculated their de-</p><p>scent Svith amazing subtlety—their mathematical </p><p>learning is evidently far in excess of ours—and to </p><p>have carried out their preparations with a well- </p><p>424 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>nigh perfect unanimity. Had our instruments per- </p><p>mitted it, we might have seen the gathering trouble </p><p>far back in the nineteenth century. Men like Schia- </p><p>parelli watched the red planet—it is odd, by-the-by, </p><p>that for countless centuries Mars has been the star </p><p>of war—but failed to interpret the fluctuating ap- </p><p>pearances of the markings they mapped so well. </p><p>All that time the Martians must have been getting </p><p>ready. </p><p>DURING the opposition of 1894, a great light </p><p>was seen on the illuminated part of the disc, </p><p>first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of </p><p>Nice, and then by other observers. English readers </p><p>heard of it first in the issue of Nature dated August </p><p>2. I am inclined to think that the appearance may </p><p>have been the casting of the huge gun, the vast pit </p><p>sunk into their planet, from which their shots were </p><p>fired at us. Peculiar markings, as yet unexplained, </p><p>were seen near the site of that outbreak during the </p><p>next two oppositions. </p><p> The storm burst upon us six years ago now. As</p><p>Mars approached opposition, Lavelle of Java set the </p><p>wires of the astronomical exchange palpitating with </p><p>the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of in- </p><p>candescent gas upon the planet. It had occurred </p><p>towards midnight of the 12th, and the spectroscope, </p><p>to which he had at once resorted, indicated a mass </p><p>of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an </p><p>enormous velocity towards this earth. This jet of </p><p>fire had become invisible about a quarter past </p><p>twelve. He compared it to a colossal puiT of flame, </p><p>suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, </p><p>“as flaming gas rushes out of a gun.” </p><p> A singularly appropriate phrase it proved. Yet</p><p>the next day there was nothing of this in the papers, </p><p>except a little note in the Daily Telegraph, and the </p><p>world went in ignorance of one of the gravest dan- </p><p>gers that ever threatened the human race. I might </p><p>not have heard of the eruption at all had T not met </p><p>Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer, at Ottershaw. </p><p>He was immensely excited at the news, and in the </p><p>excess of his feelings invited me up to take a turn </p><p>with him that night in a scrutiny of the red planet. </p><p> In spite of all that has happened since, I still re-</p><p>member th.it vigil very distinctly: the black and </p><p>silent observatory, the shadowed lantern throwing </p><p>a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the steady </p><p>ticking of the clockwork of the telescope, the little </p><p>slit in the roof—an oblong profundity with the star </p><p>dust streaked across it. Ogilvy moved about, in- </p><p>visible but audible. Looking through the telescope,</p><p>one saw a circle of deep blue, and the little round </p><p>planet swimming in the field. It seemed such a little </p><p>thing, so bright and small and still, faintly marked </p><p>with transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from </p><p>the perfect round. But so little it was, so silvery </p><p>warm, a pin’s head of light! It was as if it quivered </p><p>a little, but really this was the telescope vibrating </p><p>with the activity of the clockwork that kept the </p><p>planet in view. </p><p> As I watched, the little star seemed to grow</p><p>larger and smaller, and to advance and recede, but </p><p>it was simply because my eye was tired. Forty mil- </p><p>lions of miles it. was from us—more than 40,000,- </p><p>000	miles of void. Few people realize the immensity</p><p>of vacancy in which the dust of the material uni- </p><p>verse swims. </p><p> Near it in the field, I remember, were three little</p><p>points of light, three telescopic stars infinitely re- </p><p>mote, and all around it was the unfathomable dark- </p><p>ness of empty space. You know how that blackness </p><p>looks on a frosty starlight night. In a telescope </p><p>it seems far profounder. And invisible to me, be- </p><p>cause it was so remote and small, flying swiftly and </p><p>steadily towards me across that incredible distance, </p><p>drawing1 nearer every minute by so many thousands </p><p>of miles, came the Thing they were sending us, the </p><p>Thing that was to bring so much struggle and </p><p>calamity and death to the earth. I never dreamt of </p><p>it then as I watched; no one on earth dreamt of </p><p>that unerring missile. </p><p> That night, too, there was another jetting out of</p><p>gas from the distant planet. I saw it. A reddish </p><p>flash at the edge, the slightest projection of the out- </p><p>line, just as the chronometer struck midnight, and </p><p>at that I told Ogilvy, and he took my place. The </p><p>night was warm and I was thirsty, and I went, </p><p>stretching my legs clumsily, and feeling my way in </p><p>the darkness, to the little table where the siphon </p><p>stood, while Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of </p><p>gas that came out towards us. </p><p> That night another invisible missile started on its</p><p>way to the earth from Mars, just a second or so </p><p>under twenty-four hours after the first one. I re- </p><p>member how I sat on the table there in the black- </p><p>ness, with patches of green and crimson swimming </p><p>before my eyes. I wished I had a light to smoke by, </p><p>little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam </p><p>I had seen, and all that it would presently bring me. </p><p>Ogilvy watched till one, and then gave it up. and </p><p>we lit the lantern and walked over to his house. </p><p>Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and </p><p>Chertsey, and all their hundreds of people, sleeping</p><p>in peace. </p><p> He was full of speculation that night about the</p><p>condition of Mars, and scoffed at the vulgar idea of </p><p>its having inhabitants who were signalling us. His </p><p>idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy </p><p>shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic ex- </p><p>plosion was in progress. He pointed out to me how </p><p>unlikely it was that organic evolution had taken </p><p>the same direction in the two adjacent planets. </p><p> “The chances against anything man like on Mars</p><p>are a million to one,” he said. </p><p> Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night</p><p>and the night after, about midnight, and again the </p><p>night after, and so for ten nights, a flame each </p><p>night. Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one </p><p>on earth has attempted to explain. It may be the </p><p>gases of the firing caused the Martians inconven- </p><p>ience. Dense clouds of smoke or dust, visible </p><p>through a powerful telescope on earth as little gray, </p><p>fluctuating patches, spread through the clearness </p><p>of the planet’s atmosphere, and obscured its more </p><p>familiar features. </p><p> Even the daily papers woke up to the disturb-</p><p>ances at last, and popular notes appeared here, there </p><p>and everywhere concerning the volcanoes upon Mars. </p><p>The serio-comic periodical Punch, I remember, made </p><p>a happy use of it in the political cartoon. And, all </p><p>unsuspected, those missiles the Martians had fired </p><p>at us drew earthward, rushing now at a pace of </p><p>THE WAR OF THE WORLDS </p><p>425 </p><p>many miles a second through the empty gulf of </p><p>space, hour by hour and day by day, nearer and </p><p>nearer. It seems to me now almost incredibly won- </p><p>derful that, with that swift fate hanging over us, </p><p>men could go about their petty concerns as they </p><p>did. 1 remember how jubilant Markham was at </p><p>securing a new photograph of the planet for the </p><p>illustrated paper he edited in those days. People </p><p>in these latter times scarcely realize the abundance </p><p>and enterprise of our nineteenth-century papers. </p><p>For my own part, I was much occupied in learning </p><p>to ride the bicycle, and busy upon a series of papers </p><p>discussing the. probable developments of moral ideas </p><p>as civilization progressed. </p><p> One night (the first missile then could scarcely</p><p>have been 10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk </p><p>with my wife. It was starlight, and I explained </p><p>the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed out </p><p>Mars, a bright dot of light creeping zenithward, </p><p>towards which so many telescopes were pointed. It </p><p>was a warm night. Coming home, a party of excur- </p><p>sionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us sing- </p><p>ing and playing music. There were lights in the </p><p>upper windows of the houses as the people went to </p><p>bed. From the railway station in the distance came </p><p>the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling </p><p>softened almost into melody by the distance. My </p><p>wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red, </p><p>green and yellow signal lights, hanging in a frame </p><p>work against the sky. It seemed so safe and tran- </p><p>quil. </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>The Falling Star </p><p>THEN came the night of the first falling star. </p><p>It was seen early in the morning rushing over </p><p>Winchester eastward, a line of flame, high in </p><p>the atmosphere. Hundreds must have seen it, and </p><p>taken it for an ordinary falling star. Albin de- </p><p>scribed it as leaving a greenish streak behind it </p><p>that glowed for some seconds. Denning, our great- </p><p>est authority on meteorites, stated that the height </p><p>of its first appearance was about ninety or one hun- </p><p>dred miles. It seemed to him that it fell to earth </p><p>about one hundred miles east of him. </p><p> I was at home at that hour and writing in my</p><p>Study, and although my French windows face to- </p><p>wards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved </p><p>in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw </p><p>nothing of it. Yet this strangest of all things that </p><p>ever-came to earth from outer space must have fallen </p><p>while T was sitting there, visible to me had I only</p><p>looked up as it passed. Some of those who saw its </p><p>flight say it travelled with a hissing sound. I my- </p><p>self heard nothing of that. Many people in Berk- </p><p>shire. Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the </p><p>fall of it, and, at most, have thought that another </p><p>meteorite had descended. No one seems to have </p><p>troubled to look for the fallen mass that night. </p><p> Rut very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who</p><p>had seen the shooting star, and who was persuaded </p><p>that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common be- </p><p>tween Horsell, Ottershaw and Woking, rose early </p><p>with the idea of finding it. Find it he did, soon </p><p>after dawn, and not far from the sand-pits. An </p><p>enormous hole had been made by the impact of the </p><p>projectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung </p><p>violently in every direction over the heath and </p><p>heather, forming heaps visible a mile and a half </p><p>away. The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin </p><p>blue smoke rose against the dawn. </p><p> The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in</p><p>sand, amidst the scattered splinters of a fir-tree it </p><p>had shivered to fragments in its descent. The un- </p><p>covered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder, </p><p>caked over, and its outline softened by a thick, scaly </p><p>dun-colored incrustation. It had a diameter of about </p><p>thirty yards. He approached the mass, surprised at </p><p>the size and more so at the shape, since most mete- </p><p>orites are rounded more or less completely. It was, </p><p>however, still so hot from its flight through the air </p><p>as to forbid his near approach. A stirring noise </p><p>within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cool- </p><p>ing of its surface; for at that time it had not oc- </p><p>curred to him that it might be hollow. </p><p> He remained standing at the edge of the pit that</p><p>the thing had made for itself, staring at its strange </p><p>appearance, astonished chiefly at its unusual shape </p><p>and color, and dimly perceiving even then some evi- </p><p>dences of design in its arrival. The early morning </p><p>was wonderfully still, and the sun, just clearing the </p><p>pine-trees towards Weybridge, was already warm. </p><p>He did not remember hearing any birds that morn- </p><p>ing, there was certainly no breeze stirring, and the </p><p>only sounds were the faint movements from within </p><p>the cindery cylinder. He was all alone on the com- </p><p>mon. </p><p> Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some</p><p>of the gray clinker, the ashy incrustation that cov- </p><p>ered the meteorite, was falling off the circular edge </p><p>of the end. It was dropping off in flakes and rain- </p><p>ing down upon the sand. A large piece suddenly </p><p>came off and fell with a sharp noise that brought </p><p>his heart into his mouth. </p><p> For a minute he scarcely realized what this</p><p>meant, and. although the heat was excessive, he </p><p>clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to </p><p>see the thing more clearly. He fancied even then </p><p>that the cooling of the body might account for this, </p><p>but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the </p><p>ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder. </p><p> And then he perceived that, very slowly, the cir-</p><p>cular top of the cylinder was rotating on its body. </p><p>It. was such a gradual movement that he discovered </p><p>it only through noticing that a black mark that had </p><p>been near him five minutes ago was now at the other </p><p>side of the circumference. Even then he scarcely </p><p>understood what this indicated, until he heard a </p><p>muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk </p><p>forward an inch or so. Then the thing came upon </p><p>him in a flash. The cylinder was artificial—hollow </p><p>—with an end that screwed out! Something within </p><p>the cylinder was unscrewing the top! </p><p> “Good heavens!” said Ogilvy. “There’s a man in</p><p>it—men in it! Half roasted to death! Trying to </p><p>escape!” </p><p> At once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the</p><p>thing with a flash upon Mars. </p><p>THE thought of the confined creature was so </p><p>dreadful to him that he forgot the heat, and </p><p>went forward to the cylinder to help turn. But </p><p>luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he </p><p>could burn his hands on the still glowing metal. </p><p>426 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>At that he stood irresolute for a moment, then </p><p>turned, scrambled out of the pit, and set off running </p><p>wildly into Woking. The time then must have been </p><p>somewhere about six o’clock. He met a waggoner </p><p>and tried to make him understand, but the tale he </p><p>told, and his appearance, were so wild—his hat had </p><p>fallen off in the pit—that the man simply drove on. </p><p>He was equally unsuccessful with the potman who </p><p>was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by </p><p>Horsell Bridge. The fellow thought he was a luna- </p><p>tic at large, and made an unsuccessful attempt to </p><p>shut him into the tap-room. That sobered him a </p><p>little, and when he saw Henderson, the London </p><p>journalist, in his garden, he called over the palings </p><p>and made himself understood. </p><p> “Henderson,” he called, “you saw that shooting</p><p>star last night?” </p><p> "Well?” said Henderson.</p><p> “It's out on Horshell Common now.’’</p><p> “Good Lord!” said Henderson. “Fallen mete-</p><p>orite 1 That’s good.” </p><p> “But it’s something more than a meteorite. It’s</p><p>a cylinder—an artificial cylinder, man! And there’s </p><p>something inside.” </p><p> Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand.</p><p>“What’s that?” he said. He is deaf in one ear. </p><p>Ogilvy told him all that he had seen. Henderson </p><p>was a minute or so taking it in. Then he dropped </p><p>his spade, snatched at his jacket, and came out into </p><p>the road. The two men hurried back at once to the </p><p>common, and found the cylinder still lying in the </p><p>same position. But now the sounds inside had </p><p>ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed </p><p>between the top and the body of the cylinder. Air </p><p>was either entering or escaping at the rim with a </p><p>thin, sizzling sound. </p><p> They listened, rapped on the scale with a stick,</p><p>and, meeting with no response, they both concluded </p><p>the man or men inside must be insensible or dead. </p><p> Of course the two were quite unable to do any-</p><p>thing. They shouted consolation and promises, and </p><p>went off back to the town again to get help. One </p><p>can imagine them, covered with sand, excited and </p><p>disordered, running up the little street in the bright </p><p>sunlight, just as the shop folks were taking down </p><p>their shutters and people were opening their bed- </p><p>room windows. Henderson went into the railway</p><p>station at once, in order to telegraph the news to </p><p>London. The newspaper articles had prepared </p><p>men’s minds for the reception of the idea. </p><p> By eight o’clock a number of boys and unem-</p><p>ployed men had already started for the common to </p><p>see the “dead men from Mars.” That was the form </p><p>the story took. I heard of it first from my news- </p><p>paper boy, about a quarter to nine, when I went out </p><p>to get my Daily Chronicle. I was naturally startled, </p><p>and lost no time in going out and across the Otter- </p><p>shaw bridge to the sand-pits. </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>On Horsell Common </p><p>I FOUND a little crowd of perhaps twenty people </p><p>surrounding the huge hole in which the cylin- </p><p>der lay. I have already described the appear- </p><p>ance of that colossal bulk, imbedded in the ground. </p><p>The turf and gravel about it seemed charred as if </p><p>by a sudden explosion. No doubt its impact had </p><p>caused a flash of fire. Henderson and Ogilvy were </p><p>not there. I think they perceived that nothing was </p><p>to be done for the present, and had gone away to </p><p>breakfast at Henderson’s house. </p><p> There were four or five boys sitting on the edge</p><p>of the pit, with their feet dangling, and amusing </p><p>themselves—until I stopped them—by throwing </p><p>stones at the giant mass. After I had spoken to </p><p>them about it, they began playing at “touch” in and </p><p>out of the group of bystanders. </p><p> Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing</p><p>gardener I employed sometimes, a girl carrying a </p><p>baby, Gregg the butcher and his little boy, and two </p><p>or three loafers and golf caddies who were accus- </p><p>tomed to hang about the railway station. There </p><p>was very little talking. Few of the common people </p><p>in England had anything but the vaguest astronom- </p><p>ical ideas in those days. Most of them were staring </p><p>quietly at the big table-like end of the cylinder, </p><p>which was still as Ogilvy and Henderson had left </p><p>it. I fancy the popular expectation of a heap of </p><p>charred corpses was disappointed at this inanimate </p><p>bulk. Some went away while I was there, and </p><p>other people came. I clambered into the pit and </p><p>fancied I heard a faint movement under my feet. </p><p>The top had certainly ceased to rotate. </p><p> It was only when I got thus close to it that the</p><p>strangeness of this object was at all evident to me. </p><p>At the first glance it was really no more exciting </p><p>than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across </p><p>the road. Not so much so, indeed. It looked like a </p><p>rusty gas-float half buried, more than anything else</p><p>in the world. It required a certain amount of scien- </p><p>tific education to perceive that the gray scale of </p><p>the thing was no common oxide, that the yellowish- </p><p>white metal that gleamed in the crack between the </p><p>lid and the cylinder had an unfamiliar hue. “Extra- </p><p>terrestrial” had no meaning for most of the on- </p><p>lookers. </p><p> At that time it was quite clear in my own mind</p><p>that the Thing had come from the planet Mars, but </p><p>I judged it improbable that it contained any living </p><p>creature. I thought the unscrewing might be auto- </p><p>matic. In spite of Ogilvy, I still believed that there </p><p>were men in Mars. My mind ran fancifully on the </p><p>possibilities of its containing manuscript, on the </p><p>difficulties in translation that might arise, whether </p><p>we should find coins and models in it, and so forth. </p><p>Yet it was a little too large for assurance on this </p><p>idea. I felt an impatience to see it opened. About </p><p>eleven, as nothing seemed happening, I walked back, </p><p>full of such thoughts, to my home in Maybury. But </p><p>I found it difficult to get to work upon my abstract </p><p>investigations. </p><p> In the afternoon the appearance of the common</p><p>had altered very much. The early editions of the </p><p>evening papers had startled London with enormous </p><p>headlines: </p><p>“A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS,” </p><p>“Remarkable Story from Woking,” </p><p>and so forth. In addition, Ogilvy’s wire to the As- </p><p>tronomical Exchange had roused every observatory </p><p>in the three kingdoms. </p><p> There were half a dozen cabs or more from the</p><p>Woking station standing in the road by the sand- </p><p>pits, a basket chaise from Chobham, and a rather </p><p>THE WAR OF THE WORLDS </p><p>427 </p><p>lordly carriage. Besides that, there was quite a </p><p>heap of bicycles. In addition, a large number of </p><p>people must have walked, in spite of the heat of the </p><p>day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there was </p><p>altogether quite a considerable crowd—one or two </p><p>gaily dressed ladies among the others. </p><p> It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky, nor a</p><p>breath of wind, and the only shadow was that of </p><p>the few scattered pine-trees. The burning heather </p><p>had been extinguished, but the level ground towards </p><p>Ottershaw was blackened as far as one could see, </p><p>and still giving off vertical streamers of smoke. An </p><p>enterprising sweetstuff dealer in the Chobham Road </p><p>had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green </p><p>apples and ginger-beer. </p><p> Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied</p><p>by a group of about half a dozen men—Henderson, </p><p>Ogilvy, and a tall fair-haired man that I afterwards </p><p>learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with sev- </p><p>eral workmen wielding spades and pickaxes. Stent </p><p>was giving directions in a clear, high-pitched voice. </p><p>He was standing on the cylinder, which was now </p><p>evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and </p><p>streaming with perspiration, and something seemed </p><p>to have irritated him. </p><p> A large portion of the cylinder had been uncover-</p><p>ed, though its lower end was still embedded. As </p><p>soon as Ogilvy saw me among the staring crowd on </p><p>the edge of the pit, he called to me to come down, </p><p>and asked me if I would mind going over to see </p><p>Lord Hilton, the lord of the manor. </p><p> The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a</p><p>serious impediment to their excavations, especially </p><p>the boys. They wanted a light railing put up, and </p><p>help to keep the people back. He told me that a </p><p>faint stirring was occasionally still audible within </p><p>the case, but that the workmen had failed to un- </p><p>screw the top, as it afforded no grip to them. The </p><p>case appeared to be enormously thick, and it was </p><p>possible that the faint sounds we heard represented </p><p>a noisy tumult in the interior. </p><p> I was very glad to do as he asked, and so become</p><p>one of the privileged spectators within the contem- </p><p>plated enclosure. I failed to find Lord Hilton at his </p><p>house, but I was told he was expected from London </p><p>by the six o’clock train from Waterloo; and as it </p><p>was then about a quarter past five, I went home, </p><p>had some tea, and walked up to the station to way- </p><p>lay him. </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>The Cylinder Unscrews </p><p>WHEN I returned to the common the sun was </p><p>setting. Scattered groups were hurrying </p><p>from the direction of Woking, and one or </p><p>two persons were returning. The crowd about the </p><p>pit had increased, and stood out black against the </p><p>lemon-yellow of the sky—a couple of hundred people </p><p>perhaps. There were a number of voices raised, </p><p>and some sort of struggle appeared to be going on </p><p>about the pit. Strange imaginings passed through </p><p>my mind. As I drew nearer I heard Stent’s voice: </p><p>“Keep back! Keep back!” </p><p> A boy came running towards me.</p><p> “It’s a movin’,” he said to me as he passed—“a-</p><p>screwin' and a-screwin’ out. I don’t like it. I’m a- </p><p>goin’ ’ome, I am.” </p><p> I went on to the crowd. There were really, I</p><p>should think, two or three hundred people elbowing </p><p>and jostling one another, the one or two ladies there </p><p>being by no means the least active. </p><p> “He’s fallen in the pit!” cried someone.</p><p> “Keep back!” said several.</p><p> The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way</p><p>through. Everyone seemed greatly excited. I heai-d </p><p>a peculiar humming sound from the pit. </p><p> “I say!” said Ogilvy, “help keep those idiots back.</p><p>We don’t know what’s in the confounded thing, you </p><p>know!” </p><p> I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking</p><p>I believe he was, standing on the cylinder and trying </p><p>to scramble out of the hole again. The crowd had </p><p>pushed him in. </p><p> The end of the cylinder was being screwed out</p><p>from within. Nearly two feet of shining screw pro- </p><p>jected. Somebody blundered against me, and I nar- </p><p>rowly missed being pitched on to the top of the </p><p>screw. I turned, and as I did so the screw must </p><p>have come out, and the lid of the cylinder fell upon </p><p>the gravel with a ringing concussion. I stuck my </p><p>elbow into the person behind me, and turned my </p><p>head towards the Thing again. For a moment that </p><p>circular cavity seemed perfectly black. I had the </p><p>sunset in my eyes. </p><p> I think everyone expected to see a man emerge—</p><p>possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men, </p><p>but in all essentials a man. I know I did. But,</p><p>looking, I presently saw something stirring within </p><p>the shadow—grayish billowy movements, one above </p><p>another, and then two luminous discs like eyes. </p><p>Then something resembling a little snake, about </p><p>the thickness of a walking-stick, coiled up out of </p><p>the writhing middle, and wriggled in the air to- </p><p>wards me—and then another. </p><p> A sudden chill came over me. There was a loud</p><p>shriek from a woman behind. I half turned, keep- </p><p>ing my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still, from </p><p>which other tentacles were now projecting, and be- </p><p>gan pushing my way back from the edge of the </p><p>pit. I saw astonishment giving place to horror on </p><p>the faces of the people about me. I heard inarticu- </p><p>late exclamations 011 all sides. There was a gen- </p><p>eral movement backward. I saw the shopman </p><p>struggling still on the edge of the pit. I found </p><p>myself alone, and saw the people on the other side </p><p>of the pit running off, Stent among them. I looked </p><p>again at the cylinder, and ungovernable terror </p><p>gripped me. I stood petrified and staring. </p><p> A big grayish, rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of</p><p>a bear, was rising slowly and painfully out of the </p><p>cylinder. As it bulged up and caught the light, it </p><p>glistened like wet leather. Two large dark-colored </p><p>eyes were regarding me steadfastly. It was </p><p>rounded, and had, one might say, a face. There </p><p>was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim of </p><p>which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva. </p><p>The body heaved and pulsated convulsively. A lank </p><p>tentacular appendage gripped the edge of the cylin- </p><p>der, another swayed in the air. </p><p> Those who have never seen a living Martian can</p><p>scarcely imagine the strange horror of their ap- </p><p>pearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its </p><p>pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the </p><p>absence of a chin beneath, the wedge-like lower lip, </p><p>428 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>the incessant quivering of this mouth, the Gorgon </p><p>groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of </p><p>the lungs in a strange atmosphere, the evident </p><p>heaviness and painfulness of movement, due to the </p><p>greater gravitational energy of the earth—above </p><p>all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes </p><p>—culminated in an effect akin to nausea. There </p><p>was something fungoid in the oily brown skin, </p><p>something in the clumsy deliberation of their tedi- </p><p>ous movements unspeakably terrible. Even at this </p><p>first encounter, this first glimpse, I was overcome </p><p>with disgust and dread. </p><p>SUDDENLY the monster vanished. It had </p><p>toppled over the brim of the cylinder and fallen </p><p>into the pit, with a thud like the fall of a great </p><p>mass of leather. I heard it give a peculiar thick </p><p>cry, and forthwith another of these creatures ap- </p><p>peared darkly in the deep shadow of the aperture. </p><p> At that my rigour of terror passed away. I</p><p>turned and, running madly, made for the first </p><p>group of trees, perhaps a hundred yards away; </p><p>but I ran slantingly and stumbling, for I could not </p><p>avert my face from these things. </p><p> There, among some young pine-trees and furze</p><p>bushes, I stopped, panting, and waited further de- </p><p>velopments. The common round the sand-pits was </p><p>dotted with people, standing, like myself, in a half- </p><p>fascinated terror, staring at these creatures, or, </p><p>rather, at the heaped gravel at the edge of the pit </p><p>in which they lay. And then with a renewed hor- </p><p>ror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up and </p><p>down on the edge of the pit. It was the head of </p><p>the shopman who had fallen in, but showing as a </p><p>little black object against the hot western sky. </p><p>Now he got his shoulder and knee up, and again </p><p>he seemed to slip back until only his head was </p><p>visible. Suddenly he vanished, and I could have </p><p>fancied a faint shriek had reached me. I had a </p><p>momentary impulse to go back and help him that </p><p>my fears overruled. </p><p> Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by</p><p>the deep pit and the heap of sand that the fall of </p><p>the cylinder had made. Anyone coming along the </p><p>road from Chobham or Woking would have been </p><p>amazed at the sight—a dwindling multitude of per- </p><p>haps a hundred people or more standing in a great </p><p>irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes, behind </p><p>gates and hedges, saying little to one another, and </p><p>that in short, excited shouts, and staring, staring </p><p>hard at a few heaps of sand. The barrow of gin- </p><p>ger-beer stood, a queer derelict, black against the</p><p>burning sky, and in the sand-pits was a row of </p><p>deserted vehicles with their horses feeding out of </p><p>nose-bags or pawing the ground. </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>The Heat-Ray </p><p>AFTER the glimpse I had had of the Martians </p><p>emerging from the cylinder in which they </p><p>had come to the earth from their planet, a </p><p>kind of fascination paralyzed my actions. I re- </p><p>mained standing knee-deep in the heather, staring </p><p>at the mound that hid them. I was a battle- </p><p>ground of fear and curiosity. </p><p> I did not dare to go back toward the pit, but I</p><p>felt a passionate longing to peer into it. I began </p><p>walking, therefore, in a big curve, seeking some </p><p>point of vantage, and continually looking at the </p><p>sand-heaps that hid these new-comers to our earth. </p><p>Once a leash of thin black whips, like the arms of </p><p>an octopus, flashed across the sunset and was im- </p><p>mediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod </p><p>rose up, joint by joint, bearing at its apex a circu- </p><p>lar disc that spun with a wobbling motion. What </p><p>could be going on there? </p><p> Most of the spectators had gathered in one or</p><p>two groups—one a little crowd towards Woking, </p><p>the other a knot of people in the direction of Chob- </p><p>ham. Evidently they shared my mental conflict. </p><p>There were few near me. One man I approached— </p><p>he was, I perceived, a neighbour of mine, though </p><p>I did not know his name—and accosted. But it </p><p>was scarcely a time for articulate conversation. </p><p> “What ugly brutes!” he said. “Good God! what</p><p>ugly brutes!” He repeated this over and oyer </p><p>again. </p><p> “Did you see a man in the pit?” I said; but he</p><p>made me no answer to that. We became silent, </p><p>and stood watching for a time side by side, deriv- </p><p>ing, I fancy, a certain comfort in one another’s </p><p>company. Then I shifted my position to a little </p><p>knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more </p><p>of elevation, and when I looked for him presently </p><p>he was walking towards Woking. </p><p> The sunset faded to twilight before anything</p><p>further happened. The crowd far away on the </p><p>left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard </p><p>now a faint murmur from it. The little knot of </p><p>people towards Chobham dispersed. There was </p><p>scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit. </p><p> It was this, as much as anything, that gave</p><p>people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals </p><p>from Woking also helped to restore confidence. At </p><p>any rate, as the dusk came on, a slow intermittent </p><p>movement upon the sand-pits began, a movement </p><p>that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the </p><p>evening about the cylinder remained unbroken. </p><p>Vertical black figures in twos and threes would ad- </p><p>vance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading </p><p>out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that </p><p>promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns. </p><p>I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit. </p><p> Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked</p><p>boldly into the sand-pits, and heard the clatter of </p><p>hoofs and the grind of wheels. I saw a lad trund- </p><p>ling off the barrow of apples. And then, within </p><p>thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direc- </p><p>tion of Horsell I noted a little black knot of men, </p><p>the foremost of whom was waving a white flag. </p><p> This was the Deputation. There had been a</p><p>hasty consultation, and, since the Martians were </p><p>evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms, intelli- </p><p>gent creatures, it had been resolved to show them, </p><p>by approaching them with signals, that we, too, </p><p>were intelligent. </p><p> Flutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right,</p><p>then to the left. It was too far for me to recogr </p><p>nize anyone there, but afterwards I learned that </p><p>Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were with others in </p><p>this attempt at communication. This little group </p><p>had in its advance dragged inward, so to speak, the </p><p>circumference of the now almost complete circle </p><p>THE WAR OF THE WORLDS </p><p>429 </p><p>of people, and a number of dim black figures fol- </p><p>lowed it at discreet distances. </p><p> Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a</p><p>quantity of luminous greenish smoke came out of </p><p>the pit in three distinct puffs, which drove up, one </p><p>after the other, straight into the still air. </p><p> This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the</p><p>better word for it) was so bright that the deep </p><p>blue sky overhead, and the hazy stretches of brown </p><p>common towards Chertsey, set with black pine- </p><p>trees, seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs </p><p>arose, and to remain the darker after their dis- </p><p>persal. At the same time a faint hissing sound </p><p>became audible. </p><p>BEYOND the pit stood the little wedge of people, </p><p>with the white flag at its apex, arrested by </p><p>these phenomena, a little knot of small vertical </p><p>black shapes upon the black ground. As the green </p><p>smoke rose, their faces flashed out pallid green, </p><p>and faded again as it vanished. </p><p> Then slowly the hissing passed into a humming,</p><p>into a long, loud, droning noise. Slowly a humped </p><p>shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a beam </p><p>of light seemed to flicker out from it. </p><p> Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare</p><p>leaping from one to another, sprang from the scat- </p><p>tered group of men. It was as if some invisible </p><p>jet impinged upon them and flashed into white </p><p>flame. It was as if each man were suddenly and </p><p>momentarily turned to fire. </p><p> Then, by the light of their own destruction, I</p><p>saw them staggering and falling, and their sup- </p><p>porters turning to run. </p><p> I stood staring, not as yet realizing that this</p><p>was death leaping from man to man in that little </p><p>distant crowd. All I felt was that it was some- </p><p>thing strange. An almost noiseless and blinding </p><p>flash of light, and a man fell headlong and lay </p><p>still, and as the unseen shaft of heat passed over </p><p>them, pine-trees burst into fire, and every dry </p><p>furze-bush became with one dull thud a mass of </p><p>flames. And far away towards Knaphill I saw </p><p>the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden build- </p><p>ings suddenly set alight. </p><p> It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this</p><p>flaming death, this invisible, inevitable sword of </p><p>heat. I perceived it coming towards me by the</p><p>flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded </p><p>arid stupefied to stir. I heard the crackle of fire </p><p>in tho sand-pits and the sudden squeal of a horse </p><p>that was as suddenly stilled. Then it was as if an </p><p>Invisible yet intensely heated finger was drawn </p><p>through the heather between me and the Martians, </p><p>and all along a curving line beyond the sand pits </p><p>the dark ground smoked and crackled. Something </p><p>fell with a crash, far away to the left where the </p><p>road from Wokfng Station opens out on the com- </p><p>mon. Forthwith the hissing and humming ceased, </p><p>and the black, dome-like object sank slowly out </p><p>of sight into the pit. </p><p> All this had happened with such swiftness that</p><p>I had stood motionless, dumfounded and dazzled by </p><p>the flashes of light. Had that death swept through </p><p>a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in </p><p>my surprise. But it passed and spared me, and </p><p>left the night about me suddenly dark and un- </p><p>familiar. </p><p> The undulating common seemed now dark almost</p><p>to blackness, except where its roadways lay gray </p><p>and pale under the deep-blue sky of the early night. </p><p>It was dark, and suddenly void of men. Overhead </p><p>the stars were mustering, and in the west the sky </p><p>was still a pale, bright, almost greenish blue. The </p><p>tops of the pine-trees and the roofs of Horsell </p><p>came out sharp and black against the western after- </p><p>glow. The Martians and their appliances were al- </p><p>together invisible, save for that thin mast upon </p><p>which their restless mirror wobbled. Patches of </p><p>bush and isolated trees here and there smoked </p><p>and glowed still, and the houses towards Woking </p><p>Station were sending up spires of flame into the </p><p>stillness of the evening air. </p><p> Nothing was changed save for that and a terrible</p><p>astonishment. The little group of black specks </p><p>with the flag of white had been swept out of exis- </p><p>tence, and the stillness of the evening, so it seemed </p><p>to me, had scarcely been broken. </p><p> It came to me that I was upon this dark com-</p><p>mon, helpless, unprotected and alone. Suddenly </p><p>like a thing falling upon me from without came— </p><p>Fear. </p><p> With an effort I turned and began a stumbling</p><p>run through the heather. </p><p> The fear I felt was no rational fear but a panic</p><p>terror, not only of the Martians, but of the dusk </p><p>and stillness all about me. Such an extraordinary </p><p>effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping </p><p>silently as a child might do. Once I had turned,</p><p>I did not dare to look back. </p><p> I remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion</p><p>that I was being played with, that presently, when </p><p>I was upon the very verge of safety, this mysteri- </p><p>ous death—as swift as the passage of light—would </p><p>leap after me from the pit about the cylinder, and </p><p>strike me down. </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>The Ileat-Ray in the Chobham Road </p><p>IT is still a matter of wonder how the Martians </p><p>are able to slay men so swiftly and so silently. </p><p>Many think that in some way they are able to </p><p>generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically </p><p>absolute non-conductivity. This intense heat they </p><p>project in a parallel beam against any object they </p><p>choose by means of a polished parabolic mirror </p><p>of unknown composition—much as the parabolic </p><p>mirror of a lighthouse projects a beam of light. </p><p>But no one has absolutely proved these details. </p><p>However it is done, it is certain that a beam of </p><p>heat is the essence of the matter. Heat, and in- </p><p>visible, instead of visible light. Whatever is com- </p><p>bustible flashes into flame at its touch, lead runs </p><p>like water, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass, </p><p>and when it falls upon water incontinently that ex- </p><p>plodes into steam. </p><p> That night nearly forty people lay under the</p><p>starlight about the pit, charred and distorted be- </p><p>yond recognition, and all night long the common </p><p>from Horsell to Maybury was deserted, and </p><p>brightly ablaze. </p><p> The news of the massacre probably reached</p><p>Chobham, Woking, and Ottershaw about the same </p><p>430 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>time. In Woking the shops had closed when the </p><p>tragedy happened, and a number of people, shop- </p><p>people and so forth, attracted by the stories they </p><p>had heard, were walking over Horsell Bridge and </p><p>along the road between the hedges that run out at </p><p>last upon the common. You may imagine the </p><p>young people brushed up after the labors of the </p><p>day, and making this novelty, as they would make </p><p>any novelty, the excuse for walking together and </p><p>enjoying a trivial flirtation. You may figure to </p><p>yourself the hum of voices along the road in the </p><p>gloaming. . . . </p><p> As yet, of course, few people in Woking even</p><p>knew that the cylinder had opened, though poor </p><p>Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to </p><p>the post-office with a special wire to an evening </p><p>paper. </p><p> As these folks came out by twos and threes upon</p><p>the open they found little knots of people talking </p><p>excitedly, and peering at the spinning mirror over </p><p>the sand-pits, and the new-comers were, no doubt, </p><p>Boon infected by the excitement of the occasion. </p><p> By half-past eight, when the Deputation was de-</p><p>stroyed, there may have been a crowd of 300 people </p><p>or more at this place, besides those who had left </p><p>the road to approach the Martians nearer. There </p><p>were three policemen, too, one of whom was </p><p>mounted, doing their best, under instructions from </p><p>Stent, to keep the people back and deter them from </p><p>approaching the cylinder. There was some booing </p><p>from those more thoughtless and excitable souls to </p><p>whom a crowd is always an occasion for noise and </p><p>horseplay. </p><p> Stent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities</p><p>of a collision, had telegraphed from Horsell to the </p><p>barracks as soon as the Martians emerged, for the </p><p>help of a company of soldiers to protect these </p><p>strange creatures from violence. After that they </p><p>returned to lead that ill-fated advance. The de- </p><p>scription of their death, as it was seen by the </p><p>crowd, tallies very closely with my own impres- </p><p>sions: the three puffs of green smoke, the deep </p><p>humming note, and the flashes of flame. </p><p> But that crowd of people had a far narrower</p><p>escape than mine. Only the fact that a hummock </p><p>of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of the </p><p>Heat-Ray saved them. Had the elevation of the </p><p>parabolic mirror been a few yards higher, none </p><p>could have lived to tell the tale. They saw the </p><p>flashes, and the men falling, and an invisible hand,</p><p>as it were, lit the bushes as it hurried towards them </p><p>through the twilight. Then, with a whistling note </p><p>that rose above the droning of the pit, the beam </p><p>swung close over their heads, lighting the tops of </p><p>the beech-trees that line the road, and splitting the </p><p>bricks, smashing the windows, firing the window- </p><p>frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin a </p><p>portion of the gable of the house nearest the corner. </p><p> In the sudden thud, hiss and glare of the igniting</p><p>trees, the panic-stricken crowd seems to have </p><p>swayed hesitatingly for some moments. </p><p> Sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the</p><p>road, and single leaves like puffs of flame. Hats </p><p>and dresses caught fire. Then came a crying from </p><p>the common. </p><p> There were shrieks and shouts, and suddenly a</p><p>mounted policeman came galloping through the </p><p>confusion with his hands clasped over his head, </p><p>screaming. </p><p> “They’re coming!” a woman shrieked, and in-</p><p>continently everyone was turning and pushing at </p><p>those behind, in order to clear their way to Woking </p><p>again. They must have bolted as blindly as a </p><p>flock of sheep. Where the road grows narrow and </p><p>black between the high banks the crowd jammed </p><p>and a desperate struggle occurred. All that crowd </p><p>did not escape; three persons at least, two women </p><p>and a little boy, were crushed and trampled there </p><p>and left to die amidst the terror and the darkness. </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>How I Reached Home </p><p>FOR my own part, I remember nothing of my </p><p>flight except the stress of blundering against </p><p>trees and stumbling through the heather. All </p><p>about me gathered the invisible terrors of the Mar- </p><p>tians; that pitiless sword of heat seemed whirling </p><p>to and fro, flourishing overhead before it descended </p><p>and smote me out of life. I came into the road be- </p><p>tween the cross-roads and Horsell, and ran along </p><p>this to the cross-roads. </p><p> At last I could go no further; I was exhausted</p><p>with the violence of my emotion and of my flight, </p><p>and I staggered and fell by the wayside. That was </p><p>near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gas- </p><p>works. I fell and lay still. </p><p> I must have remained there some time.</p><p> I sat up, strangely perplexed. For a moment,</p><p>perhaps, I could not clearly understand how I came </p><p>there. My terror had fallen from me like a gar- </p><p>ment. My hat had gone, and my collar had burst </p><p>away from its stud. A few minutes before there </p><p>had only been three real things before me—the </p><p>immensity of the night and space and nature, my </p><p>own feebleness and anguish, and the near approach </p><p>of death. Now it was as if something turned over, </p><p>and the point of view altered abruptly. There was </p><p>no sensible transition from one state of mind to </p><p>the other. I was immediately the self of every </p><p>day again, a decent ordinary citizen. The silent </p><p>common, the impulse of my flight, the starting </p><p>flames, were as if it were a dream. I asked myself </p><p>had these latter things indeed happened. I could </p><p>not credit it. </p><p> I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline</p><p>of the bridge. My mind was blank wonder. My </p><p>muscles and nerves seemed drained of their </p><p>strength. I dare say I staggered drunkenly. A </p><p>head rose over the arch, and the figure of a work- </p><p>man carrying a basket appeared. Beside him ran </p><p>a little boy. He passed me, wishing me good- </p><p>night. I was minded to speak to him, and did </p><p>not. I answered his greeting with a meaningless </p><p>mumble and went on over the bridge. </p><p> Over the Maybury arch a train, a billowing</p><p>tumult of white, firelit smoke, and a long cater- </p><p>pillar of lighted windows, went flying south: clat- </p><p>ter, clatter, clap, rap, and it had gone. A dim </p><p>group of people talked in the gate of one of the </p><p>houses in the pretty little row of gables that was </p><p>called Oriental Terrace. It was all so real and so </p><p>familiar. And that behind me! It was frantic, </p><p>fantastic! Such things, I told myself, could not </p><p>be. </p><p>THE WAR OF THE WORLDS </p><p>431 </p><p> Perhaps I am a man of exceptional moods. I</p><p>do not know how far my experience is common. </p><p>At times I suffer from the strangest sense of de- </p><p>tachment from myself and the world about me; I </p><p>seem to watch it all from the outside, from some- </p><p>where inconceivably remote, out of time, out of </p><p>space, out of the stress and tragedy of it all. This </p><p>feeling was very strong upon me that night. Here </p><p>was another side to my dream. </p><p> But the trouble was the blank incongruity of this</p><p>serenity and the swift death flying yonder, not </p><p>two miles away. There was a noise of business </p><p>from the gasworks and the electric lamps were all </p><p>alight. I stopped at the group of people. </p><p> “What news from the common?” said I.</p><p> There were two men and a woman at the gate.</p><p> “Eh?” said one of the men, turning.</p><p> “What news from the common?” I said.</p><p> “Ain’t yer just been there?” asked the men.</p><p> “People seem fair silly about the common," said</p><p>the woman over the gate. “What’s it all abart?” </p><p> “Haven’t you heard of the men from Mars?”</p><p>said I. “The creatures from Mars?” </p><p> “Quite enough,” said the woman over the gate.</p><p>“Thenks;” and all three of them laughed. </p><p> I felt foolish and angry. I tried and found I</p><p>could not tell them what I had seen. They laughed </p><p>again at my broken sentences. </p><p> “You’ll hear more yet,” I said, and went on to</p><p>my home. </p><p>I STARTLED my wife at the doorway, so haggard </p><p>was I. I went into the dining-room, sat down, </p><p>drank .some wine, and so soon as I could collect </p><p>myself sufficiently told her the things I had seen. </p><p>The dinner, which was a cold one, had already been </p><p>served, and remained neglected on the table while </p><p>I told my story. </p><p> “There is one thing,” I said to allay the fears</p><p>I had aroused. “They are the most sluggish things </p><p>1 ever saw crawl. They may keep the pit and kill </p><p>people who come near them, but they cannot get </p><p>out of it. . . . But the horror of them!”</p><p> “Don’t, dear!” said my wife, knitting her brows</p><p>and putting her hand on mine. </p><p> “Poor Ogilvy!” I said. “To think he may be</p><p>lying dead there!” </p><p> My wife at least did not find my experience in-</p><p>credible. When I saw how deadly white her face </p><p>was, I ceased abruptly. </p><p> “They may come here,” she said again and again.</p><p> I pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure</p><p>her. </p><p> “They can scarcely move,” I said.</p><p> I began to comfort her and myself by repeating</p><p>all that Ogilvy had told me of the impossibility of </p><p>the Martians establishing themselves on the earth. </p><p>In particular I laid stress on the gravitational diffi- </p><p>culty. On the surface of the earth the force of </p><p>gravity is three times what it is on the surface </p><p>of Mars. A Martian, therefore, would weigh three </p><p>times more than on Mars, albeit his muscular </p><p>strength would be the same. His own body would </p><p>be a cope of lead to him, therefore. That indeed </p><p>was the general opinion. Both the Times and the </p><p>Daily Telegraph, for instance, insisted on it the </p><p>next morning, and both overlooked, just as I did, </p><p>two obvious modifying influences. </p><p> The atmosphere of the earth, we now know, con-</p><p>tains far more oxygen or far less nitrogen (which- </p><p>ever way one likes to put it) than does Mars. The </p><p>invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen </p><p>upon the Martians indisputably did much to count- </p><p>erbalance the increased weight of their bodies. </p><p>And, in the second place, we all overlooked the fact </p><p>that such mechanical intelligence as the Martian </p><p>possessed was quite able to dispense with muscu- </p><p>lar exertion at a pinch. </p><p> But I did not consider these points at the time,</p><p>and so my reasoning was dead against the chances </p><p>of the invaders. With wine and food, the confi- </p><p>dence of my own table, and the necessity of reas- </p><p>suring my wife, I gnw, by insensible degrees, </p><p>courageous and secure. </p><p> “They have done a foolish thing,” said I, finger-</p><p>ing my wineglass. “They are dangerous, because </p><p>no doubt they are mad with terror. Perhaps they </p><p>expected to find no living things—certainly no in- </p><p>telligent living things. A shell in the pit,” said I, </p><p>"if the worst comes to the worst, will kill them all.”</p><p> The intense excitement of the events had no</p><p>doubt left my perceptive powers in a state of ere- </p><p>thism. I remember that dinner-table with ex- </p><p>traordinary vividness even now. My dear wife’s </p><p>sweet, anxious face peering at me from under the </p><p>pink lamp-shade, the white cloth with its silver and </p><p>glass table furniture—for in those days even </p><p>philosophical writers had many little luxuries—the </p><p>crimson-purple wine in my glass, are photographi- </p><p>cally distinct. At the end of it I sat, tempering </p><p>nuts with a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy’s rashness, </p><p>and denouncing the short-sighted timidity of the </p><p>Martians. </p><p> So some respectable dodo in the Mauritius might</p><p>have lorded it in his nest, and discussed the ar- </p><p>rival of that shipful of pitiless sailors in want of </p><p>animal food. “We will peck them to death to- </p><p>morrow, my dear.” </p><p> I did not know it, but that was the last civilized</p><p>dinner I was to eat for very many long and terrible </p><p>days. </p><p>CHAPTER VIII </p><p>Friday Night </p><p>THE most extraordinary thing to my mind, </p><p>of all the strange and wonderful things that </p><p>happened upon that Friday, was the dove- </p><p>tailing of the commonplace habits of our social </p><p>order with the first beginnings of the series of </p><p>events that was to topple that social order head- </p><p>long. If on Friday night you had taken a pair of </p><p>compasses and drawn a circle with a radius of </p><p>five miles round the Woking sand-pits, I doubt if </p><p>you would have had one human being outside it, </p><p>unless it was some relation of Stent or of the </p><p>three or four cyclists or London people who lay </p><p>dead on the common, whose emotions or habits </p><p>were not at all affected by the new-comers. Many </p><p>people had heard of the cylinder, of course, and </p><p>talked about it in their leisure, but it certainly did </p><p>not make the sensation an ultimatum to Germany </p><p>would have done. </p><p>In London that night poor Hen&lt;Jerson’s telegram </p><p>432 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>describing the gradual unscrewing of the shot was </p><p>judged to be a canard, and his evening paper, after </p><p>wiring for authentication from him and receiving </p><p>110 reply—the man was killed—decided not to print </p><p>a special edition. </p><p> Within the five-mile circle even the great ma-</p><p>jority of people were inert. I have already de- </p><p>scribed the behaviour of the men and women to </p><p>whom I spoke. All over the district people were </p><p>dining and supping; working-men were gardening </p><p>after the labors of the day, children' were being </p><p>put to bed, young people were wandering through </p><p>the lanes love-making, students sat over their books. </p><p> Maybe there was a murmur in the village streets,</p><p>a novel and dominant topic in the public-houses, </p><p>and here and there a messenger, or even an eye- </p><p>witness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl of </p><p>excitement, a shouting and a running to and fro; </p><p>but for the most part the daily routine of working, </p><p>eating, drinking, sleeping, went 011 as it had done </p><p>for countless years— as though no planet Mars </p><p>existed in the sky. Even at Woking Station and </p><p>Horsell and Chobham that was the case. </p><p> In Woking Junction, until a late hour, trains</p><p>were stopping and going on, others were shunting </p><p>on the sidings, passengers were alighting and wait- </p><p>ing, and everything was proceeding in the most </p><p>ordinary way. A boy from town, trenching on </p><p>Smith’s monopoly, was selling papers with the </p><p>afternoon’s news. The ringing and impact of </p><p>trucks, the sharp whistle of the engines from the </p><p>junction, mingled with his shouts of “Men from </p><p>Mars!” Excited men came into the station about </p><p>nine o’clock, with incredible tidings, and caused no </p><p>more disturbance than drunkards might have done. </p><p>People rattling Londonwards peered into the dark- </p><p>ness outside the carriage windows and saw only </p><p>a rare, flickering, vanishing spark dance up from </p><p>the direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil </p><p>of smoke driving across the stars, and thought that </p><p>nothing more serious than a heath fire was hap- </p><p>pening. It was only around the edge of the common </p><p>that any disturbance was perceptible. There were </p><p>half a dozen villas burning on the Woking border. </p><p>There were lights in all the houses on the common </p><p>side of the three villages, and the people there kept </p><p>awake till dawn. </p><p> A curious crowd lingered restlessly, people com-</p><p>ing and going but the crowd remaining, both on </p><p>the Chobham and Horsell bridges. One or two </p><p>adventurous souls, it was afterwards found, went</p><p>into the darkness and crawled quite near the Mar- </p><p>tians, but they never returned, for now and again </p><p>a light-ray, like the beam of a warship’s search- </p><p>light, swept the common, and the Heat-Ray was </p><p>ready to follow. Save for such, that big area of </p><p>common was silent and desolate, and the charred </p><p>bodies lay about 011 it all night under the stars, and </p><p>all the next day. A noise of hammering from the </p><p>pit was heard by many people. </p><p>SO you have the state of things on Friday night. </p><p>I11	the centre, sticking into the skin of our old</p><p>planet Earth like a poisoned dart, was this cylin- </p><p>der. But the poison was scarcely working yet. </p><p>Around it was a patch of silent common, smoulder- </p><p>ing in places, and with a few dark, dimly-seen </p><p>objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there. </p><p>Here and there was a burning bush or tree. Beyond </p><p>was a fringe of excitement, and further than that </p><p>fringe the inflammation had not crept as yet. In </p><p>the rest of the world the stream of life still flowed </p><p>as it had flowed for immemorial years. The fever </p><p>of war that would presently clog vein and artery, </p><p>deaden nerve and destroy brain, had still to de- </p><p>velop. </p><p> All night long the Martians were hammering</p><p>and stirring, sleepless, indefatigable, at work upon </p><p>the machines they were making ready, and ever </p><p>and again a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled </p><p>up to the starlit sky. </p><p> About eleven a company of soldiers came through</p><p>Horsell, and deployed along the edge of the com- </p><p>mon to form a cordon. Later a second company </p><p>marched through Chobham to deploy on the north </p><p>side of the common. Several officers from the </p><p>Inkerman barracks had been 011 the common earlier </p><p>in the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to </p><p>be missing. The Colonel of the regiment came to </p><p>the Chobham bridge, and was busy questioning </p><p>the crowd at midnight. The military authorities </p><p>were certainly alive to the seriousness of tKe busi- </p><p>ness. About eleven, the next morning’s papers </p><p>were able to say, a squadron of hussars, two </p><p>Maxims, and about 400 men of the Cardigan regi- </p><p>ment, started from Aldershot. </p><p> A few seconds after midnight the crowd in the</p><p>Chertsey road, Woking, saw a star fall from heaven </p><p>into the pine-woods to the north-west. It fell with </p><p>a greenish light, causing a flash of light like sum- </p><p>mer lightning. This was the second cylinder. </p><p>CHAPTER IX </p><p>The Fighting Begins</p><p>SATURDAY lives in my memory as a day of </p><p>suspense. It was a day of lassitude too, hot </p><p>and close, with, I am told, a rapidly fluctu- </p><p>ating barometer. I had slept but little, though my </p><p>wife had succeeded in sleeping, and I rose early. </p><p>I went into my garden before breakfast, and stood </p><p>listening, but towards the common there was noth- </p><p>ing stirring but a lark. </p><p> The milkman came as usual. I heard the rattle</p><p>of his chariot, and I went round to the side-gate to </p><p>ask the latest news. He told me thatgduring the </p><p>night the Martians had been surrounded by troops, </p><p>and that guns were expected. Then, a familiar </p><p>reassuring note, I heard a train running towards </p><p>Woking. </p><p> “They aren’t to be killed,” said the milkman, “if</p><p>that can possibly be avoided.” </p><p> I saw my neighbor gardening, chatted with him</p><p>for a time, and then strolled in to breakfast. It </p><p>was a most unexceptional morning. My neighbor </p><p>was of opinion that the troops would be able to </p><p>capture or to destroy the Martians during the day. </p><p> “It’s a pity they make themselves so unapproach- *</p><p>able,” he said. “It would be curious to learn how </p><p>they live on another planet; we might learn a thing </p><p>or two.” </p><p> He came up to the fence and extended a handful</p><p>of strawberries, for his gardening was as generous </p><p>as it was enthusiastic. At the same time he told </p><p>THE WAR OF THE WORLDS </p><p>433 </p><p>me of the burning of the pine-woods about the </p><p>Byfleet Golf Links. </p><p> “They say,” said he, "that there’s another of</p><p>tho.se blessed things fallen there—number two. But </p><p>one’s enough, surely. This lot’ll cost the insurance </p><p>people a pretty penny before everything's settled.” </p><p>He laughed with an air of the greatest good-humor </p><p>as he said this. The woods, he said, were still </p><p>burning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to me. </p><p>“They will be hot under foot for days on account </p><p>of the thick soil of pine-needles and turf,” he said, </p><p>and then grew serious over “poor Ogilvy!” </p><p> After breakfast, instead of working, I decided</p><p>to walk down towards the common. Under the </p><p>railway-bridge I found a group of soldiers—sap- </p><p>pers, I think, men in small round caps, dirty red </p><p>jackets unbuttoned, and showing their blue shirts, </p><p>dark trousers, and boots coming to the calf. They </p><p>told me no one was allowed over the canal, and, </p><p>looking along the road towards the bridge, I saw </p><p>one of the Cardigan men standing sentinel there. </p><p>I talked with these soldiers for a time; I told them </p><p>of my sight of the Martians on the previous eve- </p><p>ning. None of them had seen the Martians, and </p><p>they had but the vaguest ideas of them, so that </p><p>they plied me with questions. They said that they </p><p>did not know who had authorized the movements of </p><p>the troops; their idea was that a dispute had arisen </p><p>at the Horse Guards. The ordinary sapper is a </p><p>great deal better educated than the common </p><p>soldier, and they discussed the peculiar conditions </p><p>of the possible fight with some acuteness. I de- </p><p>scribed the Heat-Ray to them, and they began to </p><p>argue among themselves. </p><p> “Crawl up under cover and rush ’em, say I,”</p><p>said one. </p><p> "Get aht!’’ said another. “What’s Cover against</p><p>this 'ere ’eat? Sticks to cook yer! What we got </p><p>to do is to go as near as the ground’ll let us, and </p><p>then drive a trench.” </p><p> "Blow yer trenches! You always want trenches;</p><p>you ought to ha’ been born a rabbit. Snippy." </p><p> “Ain’t they pot any necks, then?” said a third</p><p>abruptly—a little, contemplative, dark man, smok- </p><p>ing a pipe. </p><p> I repeated my description.</p><p> "Octopuses," said he, “that’s what I calls ’em.</p><p>Talk about fishers of men—fighters of fish it is </p><p>this time!” </p><p> “It ain’t no murder killing beasts like that,” said</p><p>the first speaker. </p><p> “Why not shell the darn things strite off and</p><p>finish ’em?” said the little dark man. “You carnt </p><p>tell what they might do.” </p><p> “Where’s your shells?” said the first speaker.</p><p>“There ain’t no time. Do it in a rush, that’s my </p><p>tip, and do it at once.” </p><p> So they discussed it. After a while T left them,</p><p>and went on to the railway-station to get as many </p><p>morning papers as I could. </p><p> But I will not weary the reader with a descrip-</p><p>tion of that long morning and of the longer after- </p><p>noon. I did not succeed in getting a giimpse of </p><p>the common, for even Horsell and Chobham church </p><p>towers were in the hands of the military authori- </p><p>ties. The soldiers I addressed didn’t know any- </p><p>thing; the officers were mysterious as well as busy. </p><p>I found people in the town quite secure again in </p><p>the presence of the military, and I heard for the </p><p>first time from Marshall, the tobacconist, that his </p><p>son was among the dead on the common. The </p><p>soldiers had made the people on the outskirts of </p><p>Horsell lock up and leave their houses. </p><p>I GOT back to lunch about two, very tired, for, </p><p>as I have said, the day was extremely hot and </p><p>dull, and in order to refresh myself I took a cold </p><p>bath in the afternoon. About half-past four I went </p><p>up to the railway-station to get an evening paper, </p><p>for the morning papers had contained only a very </p><p>inaccurate description of the killing of Stent, Hen- </p><p>derson, Ogilvy, and the others. But there was </p><p>little I didn’t know. The Martians did not show </p><p>an inch of themselves. They seemed busy in their </p><p>pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an </p><p>almost continuous streamer of smoke. Apparently, </p><p>they were busy getting ready for a struggle. </p><p>“Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but </p><p>without success,” was the stereotyped formula of </p><p>the papers. A sapper told me it was done by a </p><p>man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole. The </p><p>Martians took as much notice of such advances </p><p>as we should of the lowing of a cow. </p><p> I must confess the sight of all this armament,</p><p>all this preparation, greatly excited me. My imag- </p><p>ination became belligerent, and defeated the in- </p><p>vaders in a dozen striking ways; something of </p><p>my schoolboy dreams of battle and heroism came</p><p>back. It hardly seemed a fair fight to me at that </p><p>time. They seemed very helpless in this pit of </p><p>theirs. </p><p> About three o’clock there began the thud of a</p><p>gun at measured intervals from Chertsey or Addle- </p><p>stone. I learned that the smouldering pine-wood </p><p>into which the second cylinder had fallen was being </p><p>shelled, in the hope of destroying that object before </p><p>it opened. It was only about five, however, that </p><p>a field-gun reached Chobham for use against the </p><p>first body of Martians. </p><p> About six in the evening, as I sat at tea with</p><p>my wife in the summer-house talking vigorously </p><p>about the battle that was lowering upon us, I </p><p>heard a muffled detonation from the common, and </p><p>immediately after a gust of firing. Close on the </p><p>heels of that came a violent, rattling crash, quite </p><p>close to us, that shook the ground; and, starting </p><p>out upon the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees </p><p>about the Oriental College burst into smoky red </p><p>flame, and the tower of the little church beside it </p><p>slide down into ruin. The pinnacle of the mosque </p><p>had vanished, and the roof-line of the college itself </p><p>looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been at work </p><p>upon it. One of our chimneys cracked as if a </p><p>shot had hit it, flew, and the piece of it came clat- </p><p>tering down the tiles and made a heap of broken </p><p>red fragments upon the flower-bed by my study </p><p>window. </p><p> I and my wife stood amazed. Then I realized</p><p>that the crest of Maybury Hill must be within </p><p>range of the Martians’ Heat-Ray now that the col- </p><p>lege was cleared out of the way. </p><p> At that I gripped my wife’s arm. and without</p><p>ceremony ran her out into the road. Then I fetched </p><p>434 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>out the servant, telling her I would go upstairB </p><p>myself for the box she was clamouring for. </p><p> “We can’t possibly stay here,” I said; and as I</p><p>spoke the firing re-opened for a moment upon the </p><p>common. </p><p> “But where are we to go?” said my wife in</p><p>terror. </p><p> I thought, perplexed. Then I remembered her</p><p>cousins at Leatherhead. </p><p> "Leatherhead!” I shouted above the sudden noise.</p><p> She looked away from me downhill. The people</p><p>were coming out of their houses astonished. </p><p> "How are we to get to Leatherhead?” she said.</p><p> Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under</p><p>the railway-bridge; three galloped through the </p><p>open gates of the Oriental College; two others dis- </p><p>mounted, and began running from house to house. </p><p>The sun, shining through the smoke that drove up </p><p>from the tops of the trees, seemed blood-red, and </p><p>threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything. </p><p> "Stop here," said I; “you are safe here;” and</p><p>I started off at once for the Spotted Dog, for I </p><p>knew the landlord had a horse and dogcart. I ran, </p><p>for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon </p><p>this side of the hill would be moving. I found him </p><p>in his bar, quite unaware of what was going on </p><p>behind his house. A man stood with his back to </p><p>me, talking to him. </p><p> “I must have a pound,” said the landlord, “and</p><p>I’ve no one to drive it.” </p><p> “I’ll give you two,” said I, over the stranger’s</p><p>shoulder. </p><p> "What for?”</p><p> “And I'll bring it back by midnight,” I said.</p><p> “Lord!” said the landlord, “what’s the hurry?</p><p>I’m selling my bit of a pig. Two pounds, and you </p><p>bring it back? What’s going on now?” </p><p> I explained hastily that I had to leave my home,</p><p>and so secured the dogcart. At the time it did not </p><p>seem to me nearly so urgent that the landlord </p><p>should leave his. I took care to have the cart there</p><p>and then, drove it off down the road, and, leaving </p><p>it in charge of my wife and servant, rushed into </p><p>my house and packed a few valuables, such plate </p><p>as we had, and so forth. The beech-trees below </p><p>the house were burning while I did this, and the </p><p>palings up the road glowed red. While I was oc- </p><p>cupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars </p><p>came running up. He was going from house to </p><p>house, warning people to leave. He was going on </p><p>as I came out of my front door, lugging my treas- </p><p>ures, done up in a table-cloth. I shouted after </p><p>him: </p><p> “What news?”</p><p> He turned, stared, bawled something about</p><p>“crawling out in a thing like a dish cover,” and </p><p>ran on to the gate of the house at the crest. A </p><p>sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the </p><p>road hid him for a moment. I ran to my neigh- </p><p>bor’s door, and rapped to satisfy myself, what I </p><p>already knew, that his wife had gone to London </p><p>with him, and had locked up their house. I went </p><p>in again according to my promise to get my </p><p>servant’s box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her </p><p>on the tail of the dogcart, and then caught the </p><p>reins and jumped up into the driver’s seat beside </p><p>my wife. In another moment we were clear of </p><p>the smoke and noise, and spanking down the op- </p><p>posite slope at Maybury Hill towards Old Woking. </p><p> In front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat-</p><p>field ahead on either side of the road, and the May- </p><p>bury Inn with its swinging sign. I saw the doc- </p><p>tor’s cart ahead of me. At the bottom of the hill </p><p>I turned my head to look at the hillside I was leav- </p><p>ing. Thick streamers of black smoke shot with </p><p>threads of red fire were driving up into the still </p><p>air, and throwing dark shadows upon the green </p><p>tree-tops eastward. The smoke already extended </p><p>far away to the east and west—to the Byfleet pine- </p><p>woods eastward, and to Woking on the west. The </p><p>road was dotted with people running towards us. </p><p>And very faint now, but very distinct through the </p><p>hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine- </p><p>gun that was presently stilled, and an intermittent </p><p>crackling of rifles. Apparently, the Martians were </p><p>setting fire to everything within range of their </p><p>Heat-Ray. </p><p> I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately</p><p>to turn ray attention to the horse. When I looked </p><p>back again the second hill had hidden the black </p><p>smoke. I slashed the horse with the whip, and </p><p>gave him a loose rein until Woking and Send lay </p><p>between us and that quivering tumult. I overtook </p><p>and passed the doctor between Woking and Send.</p><p> CHAPTER X</p><p> In the Storm</p><p>LEATHERHEAD is about twelve miles from </p><p>Maybury Hill. The scent of hay was in the </p><p>air through the lush meadows beyond Pyr- </p><p>ford, and the hedges on either side were sweet and </p><p>gay with multitudes of dog-roses. The heavy firing </p><p>that had broken out while we were driving down </p><p>Maybury Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leav- </p><p>ing the evening very peaceful and still. We got </p><p>to Leatherhead without misadventure about nine </p><p>o’clock, and the horse had an hour’s rest while I </p><p>took supper with my cousins and commended my </p><p>wife to their care. </p><p> My wife was curiously silent throughout the</p><p>drive, and seemed oppressed with forebodings of </p><p>evil. I talked to her reassuringly, pointing out </p><p>that the Martians were tied to the pit by sheer </p><p>heaviness, and, at the utmost, could but crawl a </p><p>little out of it, but -she answered only in mono- </p><p>syllables. Had it not been for my promise to the </p><p>innkeeper, she would, I think, have urged me to </p><p>stay in Leatherhead that night. Would that I had! </p><p>Her face, I remember, was very white as we </p><p>parted. </p><p> For my own part, I had been feverishly excited</p><p>all day. Something very like the war-fever, that </p><p>occasionally runs through a civilized community, </p><p>had got into my blood, and in my heart I was not </p><p>so very sorry that I had to return to Maybury that </p><p>night. I was even afraid that last fusillade I had </p><p>heard might mean the extermination of our in- </p><p>vaders from Mars. I can best express my state </p><p>of mind by saying that I wanted to be in at the </p><p>death. </p><p> It was nearly eleven when I started to return.</p><p>The night was unexpectedly dark; to me, walking </p><p>out of the lighted passage of my cousin’s house, it </p><p>THE WAR OF THE WORLDS </p><p>435 </p><p>seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close as </p><p>the day. Overhead the clouds were driving fast, </p><p>albeit not a breath stirred the shrubs about us. </p><p>My cousin’s man lit. both lamps. Happily, I knew </p><p>the road intimately. My wife stood in the light </p><p>of the doorway, and watched me until I jumped </p><p>up into the dogcart. Then abruptly she turned </p><p>and went in, leaving my cousins side by side wish- </p><p>ing me good hap. </p><p> I was a little depressed at first with the con-</p><p>tagion of my wife’s fears, but very soon my </p><p>thoughts reverted to the Martians. At that time </p><p>I was absolutely in the dark as to the course of </p><p>the evening’s fighting. I did not know even the </p><p>circumstances that had precipitated the conflict. </p><p>As I came through Ockham (for that was the way </p><p>I returned, and not through Send and Old Wok- </p><p>ing) I saw along the western horizon a blood-red </p><p>glow, which, as I drew nearer, crept slowly up the </p><p>sky. The driving clouds of the gathering thunder- </p><p>storm mingled there with masses of black and red </p><p>smoke. </p><p> Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a</p><p>lighted window or so the village showed not a </p><p>sign of life; but I narrowly escaped an accident </p><p>at the corner of the road to Pyrford, where a knot </p><p>of people stood with their backs to me. They said </p><p>nothing to me as T passed. I do not know what they </p><p>knew of the things happening beyond the hill, nor </p><p>do I know if the silent houses I passed on my way </p><p>were sleeping securely, or deserted and empty, or </p><p>harassed and watching against the terror of the </p><p>night. </p><p> From Ripley until T came through Pyrford I</p><p>was in the valley of the Wey, and the red glare </p><p>was hidden from me. As I ascended the little hill </p><p>beyond Pyrford Church the glare came into view </p><p>again, and the trees about me shivered with the </p><p>first intimation of the storm that was upon me. </p><p>Then T heard midnight pealing out from Pyrford </p><p>Church behind me, and then came the silhouette </p><p>of Maybury Hill, with its tree-tops and roofs black </p><p>and sharp against the red. </p><p> Even as T beheld this a lurid green glare lit</p><p>the road about me, and showed the distant woods </p><p>towards Addlestone. T felt a tug at the reins. </p><p>I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as </p><p>it were by a thread of green fire, suddenly light- </p><p>ing their confusion and falling into the fields to </p><p>my left. It was the Third Falling Star! </p><p> Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by</p><p>contrast, danced out the first lightning of the gath- </p><p>ering storm, and the thunder burst like a rocket </p><p>overhead. The horse took the bit between his teeth </p><p>and bolted. </p><p> A moderate incline runs down towards the foot</p><p>of Maybury Hill, and down this we clattered. Once </p><p>the lightning had begun, it went on in as rapid a </p><p>succession of flashes as I have ever seen. The </p><p>thunder-claps, treading one on the heels of another </p><p>and with a strange crackling accompaniment, </p><p>sounded more like the working of a gigantic elec- </p><p>tric machine than the usual detonating reverbera- </p><p>tions. The flickering light was blinding and con- </p><p>fusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at my face </p><p>as I drove down the slope. </p><p>AT first I regarded little but the road before </p><p>me, and then abruptly my attention was ar- </p><p>rested by something that was moving rapidly down </p><p>the opposite slope of Maybury Hill. At first I took </p><p>it for the wet roof of a house, but one flash fol- </p><p>lowing another showed it to be in swift rolling </p><p>movement. It was an elusive vision—a moment </p><p>bewildering darkness, and then in a flash like day- </p><p>light, the red masses of the Orphanage near the </p><p>crest of the hill, the green tops of the pine-trees, </p><p>and this problematical object came out clear and </p><p>sharp and bright. </p><p> And this thing I saw! How can I describe it?</p><p>A monstrous tripod, higher than many houses, </p><p>striding over the young pine-trees, and smashing </p><p>them aside in its career; a walking engine of glit- </p><p>tering metal, striding now across the heather; </p><p>articulate ropes of steel dangling from it, and the </p><p>clattering tumult of its passage mingling with the </p><p>riot of the thunder. A flash, and it came out </p><p>vividly, heeling over one way with two feet in </p><p>the air, to vanish and reappear almost instantly </p><p>as it seemed, with the next flash, a hundred yards </p><p>nearer. Can you imagine a milking-stool tilted and </p><p>bowled violently along the ground? That was the </p><p>impression those instant flashes gave. But instead </p><p>of a milking-stool imagine it a great body of ma- </p><p>chinery on a tripod stand. </p><p> Then suddenly the trees in the pine-wood ahead</p><p>of me were parted, as brittle reeds are parted by </p><p>a man thrusting through them; they were snapped </p><p>off and driven headlong, and a second huge tripod </p><p>appeared, rushing, as it seemed, headlong towards </p><p>me. And I was galloping hard to meet it! At </p><p>the sight of the second monster my nerve went </p><p>altogether. Not stopping to look again, I wTenched </p><p>the horse’s head hard round to the right, and in </p><p>another moment the dogcart had heeled over upon</p><p>the horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was </p><p>flung sideways and fell heavily into a shallow pool </p><p>of water. </p><p> I crawled out almost immediately, and crouched,</p><p>my feet still in the water, under a clump of furze. </p><p>The horse lay motionless (his neck was broken, </p><p>poor brute!), and by the lightning flashes I saw </p><p>I he black bulk of the overturned dogcart, and the </p><p>silhouette of the wheel still spinning slowly. In an- </p><p>other moment the colossal mechanism went strid- </p><p>ing by me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford. </p><p> Seen nearer, the thing was incredibly strange,</p><p>for it was no mere insensate machine driving on its </p><p>way. Machine it was, with a ringing metallic pace, </p><p>and long flexible glittering tentacles (one of which </p><p>gripped a young pine-tree) swinging and rattling </p><p>about its strange body. It picked its road as it </p><p>went striding along, and the brazen hood that sur- </p><p>mounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable </p><p>suggestion of a head looking about it. Behind the </p><p>main body was a huge thing of white metal like </p><p>a gigantic fisherman’s basket, and puffs of green </p><p>smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs </p><p>as the monster swept by me. And in an instant </p><p>it was gone. </p><p> So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flicker-</p><p>ing of the lightning, in blinding high lights and </p><p>dense black shadows. </p><p> As it passed it set up an exultant deafening</p><p>436 </p><p>AMAZING' STORIES </p><p>howl that drowned the thunder, “Aloo! aloo!” and </p><p>in another minute it was with its companion, and </p><p>half a mile away, stooping over something in the </p><p>field. I have no doubt this thing in the field was </p><p>the third of the ten cylinders they had fired at us </p><p>from Mars. </p><p> For some minutes I lay there in the rain and</p><p>darkness watching, by the intermittent light, these </p><p>monstrous beings of metal moving about in the </p><p>distance over the hedge-tops. A thin hail was </p><p>now beginning, and as it came and went, their </p><p>figures grew misty and then flashed into clearness </p><p>again. Now and then came a gap in the lightning, </p><p>and the night swallowed them up. </p><p> I was soaked with hail above and puddle-water</p><p>below. It was some time before my blank astonish- </p><p>ment would let me struggle up the bank to a drier </p><p>position, or think at all about my imminent peril. </p><p> Not far from me was a little one-roomed squat-</p><p>ter’s hut of wood, surrounded by a patch of potato- </p><p>garden. I struggled to my feet at last, and, crouch- </p><p>ing and making use of every chance of cover, I </p><p>made a run for this. I hammered at the door, </p><p>but I could not make the people hear (if there </p><p>were any people inside), and after a time I de- </p><p>sisted, and, availing myself of a ditch for the </p><p>greater part of the way, succeeded in crawling, </p><p>unobserved by these monstrous machines, into the </p><p>pine-wood towards Maybury. </p><p> Under cover of this I pushed on, wet and shiver-</p><p>ing now, towards my own house. I walked among </p><p>the trees trying to find the footpath. It was very </p><p>dark indeed in the wood, for the lightning was </p><p>now becoming infrequent, and the hail, which waa </p><p>pouring down in a torrent, fell in columns through </p><p>the gaps in the heavy foliage. </p><p> If I had fully realized the meaning of all the</p><p>things I had seen I should have immediately </p><p>worked my way round through Byfleet to Street </p><p>Cobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife at </p><p>Leatherhead. But that night the strangeness of </p><p>things about me, and my physical wretchedness, </p><p>prevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the </p><p>skin, deafened and blinded by the storm. </p><p> I had a vague idea of going to my own house,</p><p>and that was as much motive as I had. I staggered </p><p>through the trees, fell into a ditch and bruised </p><p>my knees against a plank, and finally splashed out </p><p>into the lane that ran down from the College Arms.</p><p>I say splashed, for the storm water was sweeping </p><p>the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent. There </p><p>in the darkness a man blundered into me and sent </p><p>me reeling back. </p><p> He gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and</p><p>rushed on before I could gather my wits sufficiently </p><p>to speak to him. So heavy was the stress of the </p><p>storm just at this place that I had the hardest </p><p>task to win my way up the hill. I went close up </p><p>to the fence on the left and worked my way along </p><p>its palings. </p><p> Near the top I stumbled upon something soft,</p><p>and, by a flash of lightning, saw between my feet </p><p>a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of boots. </p><p>Before I could distinguish clearly how the man lay, </p><p>the flicker of light had passed. I stood over him </p><p>waiting for the next flash. When it came, I saw </p><p>that he was a sturdy man, cheaply but not shabbily </p><p>dressed; his head was bent under his oody, and </p><p>he lay crumpled up close tp the fence, as though he </p><p>had been flung violently against it. </p><p> Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who</p><p>had never before touched a dead body, I stooped </p><p>and turned him over to feel for his heart. He w'as </p><p>quite dead. Apparently his neck had been broken. </p><p>The lightning flashed for a third time, and his </p><p>face leapt upon me. I sprang to my feet. It was </p><p>the landlord of the Spotted Dog, whose conveyance </p><p>I had taken. </p><p> I stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up</p><p>the hill. I made my way by the police-station and </p><p>the College Arms towards my own house. Nothing </p><p>was burning on the hillside, though from the com- </p><p>mon there still came a red glare and a rolling </p><p>tumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the </p><p>drenching hail. So far as I could see by the flashes, </p><p>the houses about me were mostly uninjured. By </p><p>the College Arms a dark heap lay in the road. </p><p> Down the road towards Maybury Bridge there</p><p>were voices and the sound of feet, but I had not </p><p>the courage to shout or to go to them. I let my- </p><p>self in with my latchkey, closed, locked and bolted </p><p>the door, staggered to the foot of the staircase and </p><p>sat down. My imagination was full of those strid- </p><p>ing metallic monsters, and of the dead body </p><p>smashed against the fence. </p><p> I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my</p><p>back to the wall, shivering violently. </p><p> CHAPTER XI</p><p> At the Window</p><p>I HAVE said already that my storms of emo- </p><p>tion have a trick of exhausting themselves. </p><p>After a time I discovered that I was cold and </p><p>wet, and with little pools of water about me on </p><p>the stair-carpet. I got up almost mechanically, </p><p>went into the dining-room and drank some whisky, </p><p>and then I was moved to change my clothes. </p><p> After I had done that I went upstairs to my</p><p>study, but why I did so I do not know. The win- </p><p>dow of my study looks over the trees and the rail- </p><p>way towards Horsell Common. In the hurry of </p><p>our departure this window had been left open. </p><p>The passage was dark, and, by contrast with the </p><p>picture the window-frame enclosed, that side of the </p><p>room seemed impenetrably dark. I stopped short </p><p>in the doorway. </p><p> The thunderstorm had passed. The towers of</p><p>the Oriental College and the pine-trees about it had </p><p>gone, and very far away, lit by a vivid red glare, </p><p>the common about the rand-pits was visible. </p><p>Across the light, huge black shapes, grotesque and </p><p>strange, moved busily to and fro. </p><p> It seemed, indeed, as if the whole country in that</p><p>direction was on fire—a broad hillside set with </p><p>minute tongues of flame, swaying and writhing </p><p>with the gusts of the dying storm, and throwing </p><p>a red reflection upon the cloud scud above. Every </p><p>now and then a haze of smoke from some nearer </p><p>conflagration drove across the window and hid the </p><p>Martian shapes. I could not see what they were </p><p>doing, nor the clear form of them, nor recognize </p><p>the black objects they were busied upon. Neither </p><p>could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections </p><p>THE WAR OF THE WORLDS </p><p>437 </p><p>of it danced on the wall and ceiling of the study. A </p><p>sharp, resinous twang of burning was in the air. </p><p> I closed the door noiselessly and crept towards</p><p>the window. As I did so, the view opened out </p><p>until, on the one hand, it reached to the houses </p><p>about Woking Station, and on the other to the </p><p>charred and blackened pine-woods of Byfleet. </p><p>There was a light down below the hill, on the rail- </p><p>way, near the arch, and several of the houses along </p><p>the Maybury road and the streets near the station </p><p>were glowing ruins. The light upon the railway </p><p>puzzled me at first; there was a black heap and a </p><p>vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yel- </p><p>low oblongs. Then I perceived this was a wrecked </p><p>train, the fore part smashed and on fire, the hinder </p><p>carriages still upon the rails. </p><p> Between these three main centres of light, the</p><p>houses, the train, and the burning country towards </p><p>Chobham, stretched irregular patches of dark coun- </p><p>try, broken here and there by intervals of dimly </p><p>glowing and smoking ground. It was the strangest </p><p>spectacle, that black expanse set with fire. It re- </p><p>minded me, more than anything else, of the Pot- </p><p>teries seen at night. People at first I could dis- </p><p>tinguish none, though I peered intently for them. </p><p>Later I saw against the light of Woking Station </p><p>a number of black figures hurrying one after the </p><p>other across the line. </p><p> And this was the little world in which I had</p><p>been- living securely for years, this fiery chaos! </p><p>What had happened in the last seven hours I still </p><p>did not know, nor did I know, though I was be- </p><p>ginning to guess, the relation between these me- </p><p>chanical colossuses and the sluggish lumps I had </p><p>seen disgorged from the cylinder. With a queer feel- </p><p>ing of impersonal interest I turned my desk-chair </p><p>to the window, sat down, and stared at the black- </p><p>ened country, and particularly at the three gigantic </p><p>black things that were going to and fro in the </p><p>glare about the sand-pits. </p><p> They seemed amazingly busy. I began to ask</p><p>myself what they could be. Were they intelligent </p><p>mechanisms? Such a thing I felt was impossible. </p><p>Or did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing, </p><p>using, much as a man’s brain sits and rules in his </p><p>body? I began to compare the things to human </p><p>machines, to ask myself for the first time in my </p><p>life how an ironclad or a steam-engine would seem </p><p>to an intelligent lower animal. </p><p> The storm had left the sky clear, and over the</p><p>smoke of the burning land the little fading pin- </p><p>point of Mars was dropping into the west, when </p><p>the soldier came into my garden. I heard a slight </p><p>scraping at the fence, and rousing myself from </p><p>the lethargy that had fallen upon me, I looked </p><p>down and saw him dimly, clambering over the pal- </p><p>ings. At the sight of another human being my </p><p>torpor passed, and I leaned out of the window </p><p>eagerly. </p><p> “Hist!” said I in a whisper.</p><p> He stopped astride of the fence in doubt. Then</p><p>he came over and across the lawn to the corner of </p><p>the house. He bent down and stepped softly. </p><p> “Who’s there?” he said, also whispering, stand-</p><p>ing under the window and peering up. </p><p> “Where are you going?” I asked.</p><p> “God knows.”</p><p> “Are you trying to hide in here?” I inquired.</p><p> "That’s it.”</p><p> “Come into the house," I said.</p><p> I went down, unfastened the door and let him in,</p><p>and locked the door again. I could not see his </p><p>face. He was hatless, and his coat was unbuttoned. </p><p>cctv^tY God!” he said as I drew him in. </p><p> 1V1 “What has happened?” I asked.</p><p> “What hasn’t?” In the obscurity I could see</p><p>he made a gesture of despair. “They wiped us </p><p>out—simply wiped us out,” he repeated again and </p><p>again. </p><p> He followed me, almost mechanically, into the</p><p>dining-room. </p><p> “Take some whisky,” I said, pouring out a stiff</p><p>dose. </p><p> He drank it. Then abruptly he sat down before</p><p>the table, put his head on his arms, and began to </p><p>sob and weep like a little boy, in a perfect passion </p><p>of emotion, while I, with a curious forgetfulness </p><p>of my own recent despair, stood beside him won- </p><p>dering. </p><p> It was a long time before he could steady his</p><p>nerves to answer my questions, and then he an- </p><p>swered perplexingly and brokenly. He was a driver</p><p>in the artillery, and had only come into action </p><p>about seven. At that time firing was going on </p><p>across the common, and it was said the first party </p><p>of Martians were crawling slowly towards their </p><p>second cylinder under cover of a metal shield. </p><p> Later this shield staggered up on tripod legs, and</p><p>became the first of the fighting machines I had </p><p>seen. The gun he drove had been unlimbered near </p><p>Horsell, in order to command the sand-pits, and </p><p>its arrival had precipitated the action. As the </p><p>limber gunners went to the rear, his horse trod in </p><p>a rabbit-hole and came down, throwing him into a </p><p>depression of the ground. At the same moment </p><p>the gun exploded behind him, the ammunition blew </p><p>up, there was fire all about him, and he found him- </p><p>self lying among a heap of charred dead men and </p><p>dead horses. </p><p> “I lay still,” he said, “scared out of my wits,</p><p>with the fore-quarter of a horse atop of me. We’d </p><p>been wiped out. And the smell—good God! Like </p><p>burnt meat! I was hurt across the back by the </p><p>fall of the horse, and there I had to lie until I felt </p><p>better. Just like parade it had been a minute be- </p><p>fore—then stumble, bang, swish! </p><p> “Wiped out!” he said.</p><p> He had hidden behind the dead horse for a long</p><p>time, peeping out furtively across the common. The </p><p>Cardigan men had tried a rush, in skirmishing </p><p>order, at the pit, simply to be swept out of exist- </p><p>ence. Then the monster had risen to its feet, and </p><p>had begun to walk leisurely to and fro across the </p><p>common, among the few fugitives, with its head- </p><p>like hood turning about exactly like the head of a </p><p>cowled human being. A kind of arm carried a </p><p>complicated metallic case, about which green flashes </p><p>scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there </p><p>smote the Heat-Ray. </p><p> In a few minutes there was, so far as the soldier</p><p>could see, not a living thing left upon the common, </p><p>and every bush and tree upon it that was not al- </p><p>ready a blackened skeleton was burning. The hus- </p><p>438 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>sars had been on the road beyond the curvature of </p><p>the ground, and he saw nothing of them. He </p><p>heard the Maxims rattle for a time, and then be- </p><p>come still. The giant saved Woking Station and </p><p>its cluster of houses until last; then in a moment </p><p>the Heat-Ray was brought to bear, and the town </p><p>became a heap of fiery ruins. Then the thing shut </p><p>off the Heat-Ray, and, turning its back upon the </p><p>artilleryman, began to waddle away towards the </p><p>smouldering pine-woods that sheltered the second </p><p>cylinder. As it did so, a second glittering Titan </p><p>built itself up out of the pit. </p><p> The second monster followed the first, and at</p><p>that the artilleryman began to crawl very cautious- </p><p>ly across the hot heather ash towards Horsell. He </p><p>managed to get alive into the ditch along by the </p><p>side of the road, and so escaped to Woking. There </p><p>his story became ejaculatory. The place was im- </p><p>passable. It seems there were a few people alive </p><p>there, frantic for the most part, and many burnt </p><p>and scalded. He was turned aside by the fire, and </p><p>hid among some almost scorching heaps of broken </p><p>wall as one of the Martian giants returned. He </p><p>saw this one pursue a man, catch him up in one </p><p>of its steely tentacles, and knock his head against </p><p>the trunk of a pine-tree. At last, after nightfall, </p><p>the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over </p><p>the railway embankment. </p><p> Since then he had been skulking along towards</p><p>Maybury, in the hope of getting out of danger </p><p>London ward. People were hiding in trenches and </p><p>cellars, and many of the survivors had made off </p><p>towards Woking Village and Send. He had been </p><p>consumed with thirst until he found one of the </p><p>water mains near the railway arch smashed, and </p><p>the water bubbling out like a spring upon the </p><p>road. </p><p> That was the story I got from him bit by bit. He</p><p>grew calmer telling me and trying to make me </p><p>see the things he had seen. He had eaten no food </p><p>since midday, he told me early in his narrative, and </p><p>I found some mutton and bread in the pantry and </p><p>brought it into the room. We lit no lamp, for fear </p><p>of attracting the Martians, and ever and again our </p><p>hands would touch upon bread or meat. As he </p><p>talked, things about us came darkly out of the dark- </p><p>ness, and the trampled bushes and broken rose-trees </p><p>outside the window grew distinct. It would seem </p><p>that a number of men or animals had rushed across </p><p>the lawn. I began to see his face, blackened and </p><p>haggard, as no doubt mine was also. </p><p>WHEN we had finished eating we went softly </p><p>upstairs to my study, and I looked again out </p><p>of the open window. In one night the valley had </p><p>become a valley of ashes. The fires had dwindled </p><p>now. Where flames had been there were now </p><p>streamers of smoke; but the countless ruins of </p><p>shattered and gutted houses and blasted and black- </p><p>ened trees that the night had hidden stood out now </p><p>gaunt and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn. Yet </p><p>here and there some object had had the luck to es- </p><p>cape—a white railway signal here, the end of a </p><p>greenhouse there, white and fresh amidst the </p><p>wreckage. Never before in the history of warfare </p><p>had destruction been so indiscriminate and so uni- </p><p>versal. And, shining with the growing light of the </p><p>east, three of the metallic giants stood about the </p><p>pit, their cowls rotating as though they were sur- </p><p>veying the desolation they had made. </p><p> It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged,</p><p>and ever and again puffs of vivid green vapor </p><p>streamed up out of it towards the brightening dawn </p><p>—streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished. </p><p> Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham.</p><p>They became pillars of bloodshot smoke at the first </p><p>touch of day. </p><p>CHAPTER XII </p><p>What I Saw of the Destruction of Weybridge </p><p>and Shepperton </p><p>AS the dawn grew brighter we withdrew our- </p><p>selves from the window from which we had </p><p>watched the Martians, and went very quietly </p><p>downstairs. </p><p> The artilleryman agreed with me that the house</p><p>was no place to stay in. He proposed, he said, to </p><p>make his way Londonward, and thence rejoin his </p><p>battery—No. 12, of the Horse Artillery. My plan </p><p>was to return at once to Leatherhead, and so greatly </p><p>had the strength of the Martians impressed me that </p><p>I had determined to take my wife to Newhaven, and </p><p>go with her out of the country forthwith. For I </p><p>already perceived clearly that the country about </p><p>London must inevitably be the scene of a disastrous </p><p>struggle before such creatures as these could be </p><p>destroyed. </p><p> Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the</p><p>third cylinder, with its guarding giants. Had I </p><p>been alone, I think I should have-taken my chance </p><p>and struck across country. But the artilleryman </p><p>dissuaded me: “It’s no kindness to the right sort </p><p>of wife,” he said, “to make her a widow”; and in</p><p>the end I agreed to go with him, under cover of the </p><p>woods, northward as far as Street Cobham before </p><p>I parted with him. Thence I would make a big de- </p><p>tour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead. </p><p> I should have started at once, but my companion</p><p>had been in active service, and he knew better than </p><p>that. He made me ransack the house for a flask, </p><p>which he filled with whisky; and we lined every </p><p>available pocket with packets of biscuits and slices </p><p>of meat. Then we crept out of the house, and ran </p><p>as quickly as we could down the ill-made road by </p><p>which I had come overnight. The houses seemed </p><p>deserted. In the road lay a group of three charred </p><p>bodies close together, struck dead by the Heat-Ray; </p><p>and here and there were things that the people had </p><p>dropped—a clock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the </p><p>like poor valuables. At the corner turning up to- </p><p>wards the post-office a little cart, filled with boxes </p><p>and furniture, and horseless, heeled over on a </p><p>broken wheel. A cash-box had been hastily smashed </p><p>open, and thrown under the ddbris. </p><p> Except the lodge at the Orphanage, which was</p><p>still on fire, none of the houses had suffered very </p><p>greatly here. The Heat-Ray had shaved the chim- </p><p>ney-tops and passed. Yet, save ourselves, there did </p><p>not seem to be a living soul on Maybury Hill. The </p><p>majority of the inhabitants had escaped, I suppose, </p><p>by way of the Old Woking road—the road I had </p><p>taken when I drove to Leatherhead—or they had </p><p>hidden. </p><p>THE WAR OF THE WORLDS </p><p>439 </p><p> We went down the lane, by the body of the man</p><p>in black, sodden now from the overnight hail, and </p><p>broke into the woods at the foot of the hill. We </p><p>pushed through these towards the railway, without </p><p>meeting a soul. The woods across the line were but </p><p>the scarred and blackened ruins of woods; for the </p><p>most part the trees had fallen, but a certain pro- </p><p>portion still stood, dismal gray stems, with dark- </p><p>brown foliage instead of green, </p><p> On our side the fire had done no more than scorch</p><p>the nearer trees; it had failed to secure its footing. </p><p>In one place the woodmen had been at work on Sat- </p><p>urday; trees, felled and freshly trimmed, lay in a </p><p>clearing, with heaps of sawdust, by the sawing ma- </p><p>chine and its engine. Hard by was a temporary hut, </p><p>deserted. There was not a breath of wind this </p><p>morning, and everything was strangely still. Even </p><p>the birds were hushed, and as we hurried along, I </p><p>and the artilleryman talked in whispers, and looked </p><p>now and again over our shoulders. Once or twice </p><p>we stopped to listen. </p><p> After a time we drew near the road, and as we did</p><p>so we heard the clatter of hoofs, and saw through </p><p>the tree-Stems three cavalry soldiers riding slowly </p><p>towards Woking. We hailed them, and they halted </p><p>while we hurried towards them. It was a lieutenant </p><p>and a couple of privates of the 8th Hussars, with a </p><p>stand like a theodolite, which the artilleryman told </p><p>me was a heliograph. </p><p> '‘You are the first men I’ve seen coming this way</p><p>this orning,” said the lieutenant. “What’s brew- </p><p>ing?” </p><p>HIS voice and face were eager. The men behind </p><p>him stared curiously. The artilleryman jump- </p><p>ed down the bank into the road and saluted. </p><p> “Gun destroyed last night, sir. Have been hiding.</p><p>Trying to rejoin battery, sir. You’ll come in sight </p><p>of the Martians, T expect, about half a mile along </p><p>this road.” </p><p> “What the dickens are they like?” asked the lieu-</p><p>tenant. </p><p> “Giants in armor, sir. Hundred feet high. Three</p><p>legs and a body like ’luminium, with a mighty great </p><p>head in a hood, sir.” </p><p> “Get out!” said the lieutenant. “What confounded</p><p>nonsense!” </p><p> “You’ll see, sir. They carry a kind of box, sir,</p><p>that shoots fire and strikes you dead.” </p><p> "What d’ye mean—a gun?”</p><p> “No. sir,” and the artilleryman began a vivid ac-</p><p>count of the Heat-Ray. Halfway through the lieu- </p><p>tenant interrupted him and looked up at me. I was </p><p>still standing on the bank by the side of the road. </p><p> “Did you see it?” said the lieutenant.</p><p> “It’s perfectly true,” I said.</p><p> “Well,” said the lieutenant, “I suppose it’s my</p><p>business to see it too. Look here”—to the artillery- </p><p>man—“we’re detailed here clearing people out of </p><p>their houses. You’d better go along and report your- </p><p>self to Brigadier-General Marvin, and tell him all </p><p>you know. He’s at Weybridge. Know the way?” </p><p> “I do,” I said; and he turned his horse southward</p><p>again. </p><p> “Half a mile, you say?” said he.</p><p> “At most,” I answered, and pointed over the tree-</p><p>tops southwards. He thanked me and rode on, and </p><p>we saw them no more. </p><p> Further along we came upon a group of three</p><p>women and two children in the road, busy clearing </p><p>out a laborer’s cottage. They had got hold of a </p><p>little hand-truck, and were piling it up with un- </p><p>clean-looking bundles and shabby furniture. They </p><p>were all too assiduously engaged to talk to us as we </p><p>passed. </p><p> By Byfleet Station we emerged from the pine-</p><p>trees, and found the country calm and peaceful un- </p><p>der the morning sunlight. We were far beyond the </p><p>range of the Heat-Ray there, and had it not been </p><p>for the silent desertion of some of the houses, the </p><p>stirring movement of packing in others, and the </p><p>knot of soldiers standing on the bridge over the </p><p>railway and staring down the line towards Woking, </p><p>the day would have seemed very like any other Sun- </p><p>day. </p><p> Several farm wagons and carts were moving</p><p>creakily along the road to Addlestone, and suddenly </p><p>through the gate of a field we saw, across a stretch </p><p>of fiat meadow, six twelve-pounders standing neatly </p><p>at equal distances and pointing toward Woking. </p><p>The gunners stood by the guns waiting, and the </p><p>ammunition wagons were at a business-like dis- </p><p>tance. The men stood almost as if under inspection.</p><p> “That’s good!” said I. “They will get one fail-</p><p>shot, at any rate.” </p><p> The artilleryman hesitated at the gate.</p><p> “I shall go on,” he said.</p><p> Further on towards Weybridge, just over the</p><p>bridge, there were a number of men in white fatigue </p><p>jackets throwing up a long rampart, and more guns </p><p>behind. </p><p> “It’s bows and arrows against the lightning, any-</p><p>how,” said the artilleryman. “They ‘aven’t seen that </p><p>fire-beam yet.” </p><p> The officers who were not actively engaged stood</p><p>and stared over the tree-tops south-westward, and </p><p>the men digging would stop every now and again </p><p>to stare in the same direction. </p><p> Byfleet was in a tumult, people packing, and a</p><p>score of hussars, some of them dismounted, some </p><p>on horseback, were hunting them about. Three or </p><p>four black Government wagons, with crosses in </p><p>white circles, and an old omnibus, among other ve- </p><p>hicles, were being loaded in the village street. There </p><p>were scores of people, most of them sufficiently Sab- </p><p>batical to have assumed their best clothes. The </p><p>soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in mak- </p><p>ing them realize the gravity of their position. We </p><p>saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a </p><p>score or more of flower-pots containing orchids, </p><p>angrily expostulating with the corporal who would </p><p>leave them behind. I stopped and gripped his arm. </p><p> “Do you know what’s over there?” I said, point-</p><p>ing at the pine-tops that hid the Martians. </p><p> “Eh?” said he, turning. “I was explainin’ these</p><p>is vallyble.” </p><p> “Death!” I shouted. “Death is coming! Death!”</p><p>and, leaving him to digest that if he could, I hur- </p><p>ried on after the artilleryman. At the corner I </p><p>looked back. The soldier had left him, and he was </p><p>still standing by his box with the pots of orchids </p><p>on the lid of it, and staring vaguely over the trees. </p><p>440 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>NO one in Weybridge could tell us where the </p><p>headquarters were established; the whole place </p><p>was in such confusion as I had never seen in any </p><p>town before. Carts, carriages everywhere, the most </p><p>astonishing miscellany of conveyances and horse- </p><p>flesh. The respectable inhabitants of the place, men </p><p>in golf and boating costumes, wives prettily dressed, </p><p>were packing, riverside loafers energetically help- </p><p>ing, children excited, and, for the most part, highly </p><p>delighted at this astonishing variation of their Sun- </p><p>day experiences. In the midst of it all the worthy </p><p>vicar was very pluekily holding an early celebra- </p><p>tion, and his bell was jangling out above the excite- </p><p>ment. </p><p> I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the</p><p>drinking-fountain, made a very passable meal upon </p><p>what we had brought with us. Patrols of soldiers— </p><p>here no longer hussars, but grenadiers in white— </p><p>were warning people to move now or to take refuge </p><p>in their cellars as soon as the firing began. We </p><p>saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a grow- </p><p>ing crowd of people had assembled in and about the </p><p>railway-station, and the swarming platform was </p><p>piled with boxes and packages. The ordinary traf- </p><p>fic had been stopped, I believe, in order to allow </p><p>the passage of troops and guns to Chertsey, and I </p><p>have heard since that a savage struggle occurred </p><p>for places in the special trains that were put on at </p><p>a later hour. </p><p>WE remained at Weybridge until mid-day, and </p><p>at that hour we found ourselves at the place </p><p>near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames </p><p>oin. Part of the time we spent helping two old </p><p>'omen to pack a little cart. The Wey had a treble </p><p>nouth, and at this point boats are to be hired, and </p><p>here was a ferry across the river. On the Shep- </p><p>perton side was an inn, with a lawn, and beyond </p><p>that the tower of Shepperton Church—it has been </p><p>replaced by a spire—rose above the trees. </p><p> I-Iere we found an excited and noisy crowd of</p><p>fugitives. As yet the flight had not grown to a </p><p>panic, but there were already far more people than </p><p>all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross. </p><p>People came panting along under heavy burdens; </p><p>one husband and wife were even carrying a small </p><p>outhouse door between them, with some of their </p><p>household goods piled thereon. One man told us </p><p>he meant to try to get away from Shepperton Sta- </p><p>tion. </p><p> There was a lot of shouting, and one man was</p><p>even jesting. The idea people seemed to have here</p><p>was that the Martians were simply formidable hu- </p><p>man beings, who might attack and sack the town, to </p><p>be certainly destroyed in the end. Every now and </p><p>then people would glance nervously across the Wey, </p><p>at the meadows towards Chertsey, but everything </p><p>over there was still. </p><p> Across the Thames, except just where the boats</p><p>landed, everything was quiet, in vivid contrast with </p><p>the Surrey side. The people who landed there from </p><p>the boats went tramping off down the lane. The </p><p>big ferry-boat had just made a journey. Three or </p><p>four soldiers stood on the lawn of the inn, staring </p><p>and jesting at the fugitives, without offering to </p><p>help. The inn was closed, as it was now within </p><p>prohibited hours. </p><p> “What’s that!” cried a boatman, and “Shut up,</p><p>you fool!” said a man near me to a yelping dog. </p><p>Then the sound came again, this time from the di- </p><p>rection of Chertsey, a muffed thud—the sound of a </p><p>gun. </p><p> The fighting was beginning. Almost immediately</p><p>unseen batteries across the river to our right, un- </p><p>seen because of the trees, took up the chorus, firing </p><p>heavily one after the other. A woman screamed. </p><p>Every one stood arrested by the sudden stir of bat- </p><p>tle, near us and yet invisible to us. Nothing was </p><p>to be seen save flat meadows, cows feeding uncon- </p><p>cernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard wil- </p><p>lows motionless in the warm sunlight. </p><p> “The sojers Ml stop ’em,” said a woman beside me</p><p>doubtfully. A haziness rose over the tree-tops. </p><p> Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away</p><p>up the river, a puff of smoke that jerked up into the </p><p>air, and hung, and forthwith the ground heaved </p><p>under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air, </p><p>smashing two or three windows in the houses near, </p><p>and leaving us astonished. </p><p> "Here they are!” shouted a man in a blue jersey.</p><p>"Yonder! D’yer see them? Yonder!” </p><p> Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four</p><p>of the armored Martians appeared, far away over </p><p>the little trees, across the flat meadows that stretch </p><p>towards Chertsey and striding hurriedly towards </p><p>the river. Little crowded figures they seemed at </p><p>first, going with a rolling motion and as fast as </p><p>flying birds. </p><p> Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a</p><p>fifth. Their armored bodies glittered in the sun, </p><p>as they swept swiftly forward upon the guns, grow- </p><p>ing rapidly larger as they drew nearer. One on the</p><p>extreme left, the remotest, that is, flourished a huge </p><p>case high in the air, and the ghostly terrible Heat- </p><p>Ray I had already seen on Friday night smote to- </p><p>wards Chertsey, and struck the town. </p><p> At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible crea-</p><p>tures, the crowd along by the water’s edge seemed </p><p>to me to be for a moment horror-struck. There was </p><p>no screaming-or shouting, but a silence. Then a </p><p>hoarse murmur and a movement of feet—a splash- </p><p>ing from the water. A man, too frightened to drop </p><p>the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung </p><p>round and sent me staggering with a blow from </p><p>the corner of his burden. A woman thrust at me </p><p>with her hand and rushed past me. I turned, too, </p><p>with the rush of the people, but I was not too terri- </p><p>fied for thought. The terrible Heat-Ray was in my </p><p>mind. To get under water! That was it! </p><p> "Get under water!” I shouted unheeded.</p><p> I faced about again, and rushed towards the ap-</p><p>proaching Martians—rushed right down the grav- </p><p>elly beach and headlong into the water. Others did </p><p>the same. A boatload of people putting back came </p><p>leaping out as I rushed past. The stones under my </p><p>feet were muddy and slippery, and the river was so </p><p>low that I ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waist- </p><p>deep. Then as the Martian towered overhead, </p><p>scarcely a couple of hundred yards away, I flung </p><p>myself forward under the surface. The splashes of </p><p>the people in the boats leaping into the river sound- </p><p>ed like thunderclaps in my ears. People were land- </p><p>ing hastily on both sides of the river. </p><p> But the Martianl machine took no more notice for</p><p>THE WAR OF THE WORLDS </p><p>441 </p><p>the moment of the people running this way and that </p><p>than a man would of the confusion of ants in a nest </p><p>against which his foot was kicked. When, half suf- </p><p>focated, I raised my head above water the Martian’s </p><p>hood pointed at the batteries that were still firing </p><p>across the river, and as it advanced it swung loose </p><p>what must have been the generator of the Heat-Ray. </p><p>IN another moment it was on the bank, and in a </p><p>stride wading half-way across. The knees of its </p><p>foremost legs bent at the further bank, and in an- </p><p>other moment it had raised itself to its full height </p><p>again, close to the village of Shepperton. Forthwith </p><p>the six guns, which, unknown to any one on the </p><p>right bank, had been hidden behind the outskirts </p><p>of that village, fired simultaneously. The sudden </p><p>near concussions, the last close upon the first, made </p><p>my heart jump. The monster was already raising </p><p>the case generating the Ileat-Ray, as the first shell </p><p>burst six yards above the hood. </p><p> I gave a cry of astonishment. I saw and thought</p><p>nothing of the other four Martian monsters: my </p><p>attention was riveted upon the nearer incident. Si- </p><p>multaneously two other shells burst in the air near </p><p>the body as the hood twisted round in time to re- </p><p>ceive, but not in time to dodge, the fourth shell. </p><p> The shell burst clean in the face of the thing. The</p><p>hood bulged, flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tat- </p><p>tered fragments of red flesh and glittering metal. </p><p> "Hit!” shouted I, with something between a</p><p>scream and a cheer. </p><p> I heard answering shouts from the people in the</p><p>water about me. I could have leapt out of the water </p><p>with that momentary exultation. </p><p> The decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken</p><p>giant; but it did not fall over. It recovered its bal- </p><p>ance by a miracle, and, no longer heeding its steps, </p><p>and with the camera that fired the Heat-Ray now </p><p>rigidly upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Shepperton. </p><p>The living intelligence, the Martian within the hood, </p><p>was slain and splashed to the four winds of heaven, </p><p>and the thing was now but a mere intricate device </p><p>of metal whirling to destruction. It drove along in </p><p>a straight line, incapable of guidance. It struck the </p><p>tower of Shepperton Church, smashing it down as </p><p>the impact of a battering ram might have done, </p><p>swerved aside, blundered on, and collapsed with a </p><p>tremendous impact into the river out of my sight. </p><p> A violent explosion shook the air, and a spout of</p><p>water, steam, mud, and shattered metal, shot far up </p><p>into the sky. As the camera of the Heat-Ray hit </p><p>the water, the latter had incontinently flashed into </p><p>steam. In another moment a huge wave, like a </p><p>muddy tidal bore, but almost scaldingly hot, came </p><p>sweeping round the bend upstream. I saw people </p><p>struggling shorewards and heard their screaming </p><p>and shouting faintly above the seething and roar of </p><p>the Martian’s collapse. </p><p> For the moment I heeded nothing of the heat, for-</p><p>rot the patent need of self-preservation. I splashed </p><p>through the tumultuous water, pushing aside a man </p><p>in black to do so, until T could see round the bend. </p><p>Half a dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon </p><p>the confusion of the waves. The fallen Martian </p><p>came into sight downstream, lying across the river, </p><p>and for the most part submerged. </p><p> Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreck-</p><p>age, and through the tumultuously whirling wisps </p><p>I could see, intermittently and vaguely, the gigantic </p><p>limbs churning the water and flinging a splash and </p><p>spray of mud and froth into the air. The tentacles </p><p>swayed and struck like living arms, and, save for </p><p>the helpless purposelessness of these movements, it </p><p>was as if some wounded thing struggled for life </p><p>amidst the waves. Enormous quantities of a ruddy </p><p>brown fluid were spurting up in noisy jets out of </p><p>the machine. </p><p> My attention was diverted from this sight by a</p><p>furious relling, like that of the thing called a siren </p><p>in our manufacturing towns. A man, knee-deep </p><p>near the towing-path, shouted inaudibly to me and </p><p>pointed. Looking back, I saw the other Martians </p><p>advancing with gigantic strides down the river-bank </p><p>from the direction of Chertsey. The Shepperton </p><p>guns spoke this time unavailingly. </p><p> At that I ducked at once under water, and, hold-</p><p>ing my breath until movement was an agony, blun- </p><p>dered painfully along under the surface as long as I </p><p>could. The water was in a tumult about me, and </p><p>rapidly growing hotter. </p><p> When for a moment I raised my head to take</p><p>breath, and throw the hair and water from my eyes, </p><p>the steam was rising in a whirling white fog that </p><p>at first hid the Martians altogether. The noise was </p><p>deafening. Then I saw them dimly, colossal figures </p><p>of gray, magnified by the mist. They had passed by </p><p>me, and two were stooping over the frothing tumul- </p><p>tuous ruins of their comrade. </p><p> The third and fourth stood beside him in the</p><p>water, one perhaps 200 yards from me, the other</p><p>towards Laleham. The generators of the Heat-Rays </p><p>waved high, and the hissing beams smote down this </p><p>way and that. </p><p> The air was full of sound, a deafening and con-</p><p>fusing conflict of noises, the clangorous din of the </p><p>Martians, the crash of falling houses, the thud of </p><p>trees, fences, sheds, flashing into flame, and the </p><p>crackling and roaring of fire. Dense black smoke </p><p>was leaping up to mingle with the steam from the </p><p>river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and fro over </p><p>Weybridge, its impact was marked by flashes of in- </p><p>candescent white, that gave place at once to a smoky </p><p>dance of lurid flames. The nearer houses still stood </p><p>intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint and pal- </p><p>lid in the stream, with the fire behind them going to </p><p>and fro. </p><p> For a moment, perhaps, I stood there, breast-high</p><p>in the almost boiling water dumfounded at my posi- </p><p>tion, hopeless of escape. Through the reek I could </p><p>see the people who had been with me in the river </p><p>scrambling out of the water through the reeds, like </p><p>little frogs hurrying through grass from the ad- </p><p>vance of a man, or running to and fro in utter dis- </p><p>may on the towing-path. </p><p> Then suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray</p><p>came leaping towards me. The houses caved in as </p><p>they dissolved at its touch, and darted out flames; </p><p>the trees changed to fire with a roar. It flickered </p><p>up and down the towing-path, licking off the people </p><p>who ran this way and that, and came down to the </p><p>water’s edge not fifty yards from where I stood. It </p><p>swept across the river to Shepperton, and the water </p><p>in its track rose in a boiling wheal crested with </p><p>steam. I turned shoreward. </p><p>442 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> In another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at</p><p>the boiling-point, had rushed upon me. I screamed </p><p>aloud, and scalded, half blinded, agonized, I stag- </p><p>gered through the leaping, hissing water towards </p><p>the shore. Had my foot stumbled it would have </p><p>been the end. I fell helplessly, in full sight of the </p><p>Martians, upon the broad, bare gravelly spit that </p><p>runs down to mark the angle of the Wey and </p><p>Thames. I expected nothing but death. </p><p> I have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian</p><p>coming down within a score of yards of my head, </p><p>driving straight into the loose gravel, whirling it </p><p>this way and that, and lifting again; of a long sus- </p><p>pense, and then of the four carrying the debris of </p><p>their comrade between them, now clear, and then </p><p>presently faint, through a veil of smoke, receding </p><p>interminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast </p><p>space of river and meadow. And then, very slowly, </p><p>I realized that by a miracle I had escaped. </p><p>CHAPTER XIII </p><p>In London </p><p>How I Fell In with the Curate </p><p>AFTER getting this sudden lesson in the power </p><p>of terrestrial weapons, the Martians retreat- </p><p>ed to their original position upon Horsell </p><p>Common, and in their haste, and encumbered with </p><p>the d6bris of their smashed companion, they no </p><p>doubt overlooked many such a stray and unneces- </p><p>sary victim as myself. Had they left their comrade, </p><p>and pushed on forthwith, there was nothing at that </p><p>time between them and London but batteries of </p><p>twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly have </p><p>reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their </p><p>approach; as sudden, dreadful and destructive their </p><p>advent would have been as the earthquake that de- </p><p>stroyed Lisbon a century ago. </p><p> But they were in no hurry. Cylinder followed cyl-</p><p>inder in its interplanetary flight; every twenty-four </p><p>hours brought them reinforcement. And meanwhile </p><p>the military and naval authorities, now fully alive </p><p>to the tremendous power of their antagonists, work- </p><p>ed with furious energy. Every minute a fresh gun </p><p>came into position, until, before twilight, every </p><p>copse, every row of suburban villas on the hilly </p><p>slopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an </p><p>expectant black muzzle. And through the charred </p><p>and desolated area—perhaps twenty square miles </p><p>altogether—that encircled the Martian encampment </p><p>on Horsell Common, through charred and ruined </p><p>villages among the green trees, through the black- </p><p>ened and smoking arcades that had been but a day</p><p>ago pine spinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with </p><p>the heliographs that were presently to warn the </p><p>gunners of the Martian approach. But the Mar- </p><p>tians now understood our command of artillery and </p><p>the danger of human proximity, and not a man ven- </p><p>tured within a mile of either cylinder, save at the </p><p>price of his life. </p><p> It would seem these giants spent the earlier part</p><p>of the afternoon in going to and fro. transferring </p><p>everything from the second and third cylinders— </p><p>the second in Addlestone Golf Links, and the third </p><p>at P.vrford—to their original pit upon Horsell Com- </p><p>mon. Over that, above the blackened heather and </p><p>ruined buildings that stretched far and wide, stood </p><p>one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vast </p><p>fighting-machines and descended into the pit. They </p><p>were hard at work there far into the night, and the </p><p>towering pillar of dense green smoke that rose </p><p>therefrom could be seen from the hills about Mer- </p><p>row, and even, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom </p><p>Downs. </p><p> And while the Martians behind me were thus pre-</p><p>paring for their next sally, and in front of me Hu- </p><p>manity gathered for the battle, I made my way, </p><p>with infinite pains and labor, from the fire and </p><p>smoke of burning Weybridge towards London. </p><p> I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote,</p><p>drifting down-stream, and, throwing off the most of </p><p>my sodden clothes, I went after it, gained it, and so </p><p>escaped out of that destruction. There were no </p><p>oars in the boat, but I contrived to paddle, as much </p><p>as my parboiled hands would allow, down the river </p><p>towards Halliford and Walton, going very tediously, </p><p>and continually looking behind me, as you may well </p><p>understand. I followed the river because I consid- </p><p>ered the water gave me my best chance of escape, </p><p>should these giants return. </p><p> The hot water from the Martian’s overthrow</p><p>drifted down-stream with me, so that for the best </p><p>part of a mile I could see little of either bank. Once, </p><p>however, I made out a string of black figures hurry- </p><p>ing across the meadows from the direction of Wey- </p><p>bridge. Halliford, it seemed, was quite deserted, </p><p>and several of the houses facing the river were on </p><p>fire. It was strange to see the place quite tranquil, </p><p>quite desolate under the hot blue sky, with the </p><p>smoke and little threads of flame going straight up </p><p>into the heat of the afternoon. Never before had I </p><p>seen houses burning without the accompaniment of </p><p>an inconvenient crowd. A little further on the dry </p><p>reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing, and </p><p>a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a </p><p>late field of hay.</p><p> For a long time T drifted, so painful and weary</p><p>was I after the violence I had been through, and so </p><p>intense the heat upon the water. Then my fears </p><p>got the better of me again, and I resumed my pad- </p><p>dling. The sun scorched my bare back. At last, as </p><p>the bridtre at Walton was coming into sight round </p><p>the bend, my fever and faintness overcame my fears </p><p>and I landed on the Middlesex bank, and lay down, </p><p>deadly sick, amidst the long grass. I suppose the </p><p>time was then about four or five o’clock. I got up </p><p>presently, walked perhaps half a mile without meet- </p><p>ing a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow </p><p>of a hedge. I seem to remember talking wander- </p><p>inply to myself during that last spurt. I was also </p><p>very thirsty, and bitterly regretful I had drunk no </p><p>more water. It is a curious thing that I felt angry </p><p>with my wife: I cannot account for it, but my im- </p><p>potent desire to reach Leatherhead worried me ex- </p><p>cessively. </p><p>T DO not clearly remember the arrival of the </p><p>J- curate, so that I probably dozed. I became aware </p><p>of him as a seated figure in soot-smudged shirt- </p><p>sleeves, and with his upturned clean-shaven face </p><p>staring at a faint flickering that danced over the </p><p>sky. The sky was what is called a mackerel sky, </p><p>rows and rows of faint down-plumes of cloud, just </p><p>tinted with the midsummer sunset. </p><p>THE WAR OF THE WORLDS </p><p>443 </p><p> I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked</p><p>at me quickly. </p><p> “Have you any water?” I asked abruptly.</p><p>He shook his head. </p><p> "You have been asking for water for the last</p><p>hour,” he said. </p><p> For a moment we were silent, taking stock of one</p><p>another. I dare say he found me a strange enough </p><p>figure, naked save for my water-soaked trousers and </p><p>socks, scalded, and my face and shoulders blackened </p><p>from the smoke. His face was a fair weakness, his </p><p>chin retreated, and his hair lay in crisp, almost </p><p>flaxen curls on his low forehead; his eyes were </p><p>rather large, pale blue, and blankly staring. He </p><p>spoke abruptly, looking vacantly away from me. </p><p> “What does it mean?” he said. “What do these</p><p>things mean?” </p><p> I stared at him and made no answer.</p><p> He extended a thin white hand and spoke in al-</p><p>most a complaining tone. </p><p> “Why are these things permitted? What sins</p><p>have we done? The morning service was over, I </p><p>was walking through the roads to clear my brain </p><p>for the afternoon, and then—fire, earthquake, </p><p>death! As if it were Sodom and Gomorrah! All </p><p>our work undone, all the work . . . What are these </p><p>Martians?” </p><p> “What are we ?” I answered, clearing my throat.</p><p>He gripped his knees and turned to look at me </p><p>again. For half a minute, perhaps, he stared si- </p><p>lently. </p><p> “I was walking through the roads to clear my</p><p>brains,” he said. “And suddenly fire, earthquake, </p><p>death!” </p><p> He relapsed into silence, with his chin now sunk-</p><p>en almost to his knees. </p><p> Presently he began waving his hand:</p><p> “All the work—all the Sunday-schools. What</p><p>have we done—what has Weybridge done? Every- </p><p>thing gone—everything destroyed. The church! </p><p>We rebuilt it only three years ago. Gone!—swept </p><p>out of existence! Why?”</p><p> Another pause, and he broke out again like one</p><p>demented. </p><p> “The smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and</p><p>ever!” he shouted. </p><p> His eyes flamed, and he pointed a lean finger in</p><p>the direction of Weybridge. </p><p> By this time I was beginning to take his measure.</p><p>The tremendous tragedy in which he had been in- </p><p>volved—it was evident he was a fugitive from Wey- </p><p>bridge—had driven him to the very verge of his </p><p>reason. </p><p> “Are we far from Sunbury?” I said in a matter-</p><p>of-fact tone. </p><p> “What are we to do?” he asked. “Are these crea-</p><p>tures everywhere? Has the earth been given over </p><p>to them?” </p><p> “Are we far from Sunbury?”</p><p> “Only this morning I, officiated at early celebra-</p><p>tion. ...” </p><p> “Things have changed,” I said quietly. “You must</p><p>keep your head. There is still hope.” </p><p> “Hope!”</p><p> “Yes; plentiful hope—for all this destruction!”</p><p> I began to explain ray view of our position. He</p><p>listened at first, but as I went on the interest in his </p><p>eyes changed to their former stare, and his regard </p><p>wandered from me. </p><p> “This must be the beginning of the end,” he said,</p><p>interrupting me. “The end! The great and ter- </p><p>rible day of the Lord! When men shall call upon </p><p>the mountains and the rocks to fall upon them and </p><p>hide them—hide them from the face of Him that </p><p>sitteth upon the throne!” </p><p> I began to understand the position. I ceased my</p><p>labored reasoning, struggled to my feet, and, stand- </p><p>ing over him, laid my hand on his shoulder. </p><p> "Be a man,” said I. “You are scared out of your</p><p>wits. What good is religion if it collapses at calam- </p><p>ity? Think of what earthquakes and floods, wars </p><p>and volcanoes, have done before to men. Did you </p><p>think God had exempted Weybridge? ... He is </p><p>not an insurance agent, man.”</p><p> For a time he sat in blank silence.</p><p> “But how can we escape?” he asked suddenly.</p><p>"They are invulnerable, they are pitiless. ...” </p><p>“Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other,” I an- </p><p>swered. “And the mightier they are, the more sane </p><p>and wary should we be. One of them was killed </p><p>yonder not three hours ago.” </p><p> “Killed!” he said, staring about him. “How can</p><p>God’s ministers be killed?” </p><p> “I saw it happen,” I proceeded to tell him. “We</p><p>have chanced to come in for the thick of it,” said I, </p><p>“and that is all.” </p><p> “What is that flicker in the sky?” he asked</p><p>abruptly. </p><p> I told him it was the heliograph signalling—that</p><p>it was the sign of human help and effort in the sky. </p><p> “We are in the midst of it," I said, “quiet as it is.</p><p>That flicker in the sky tells of the gathering storm. </p><p>Yonder, I take it, are the Martians, and London- </p><p>ward, where those hills rise about Richmond and </p><p>Kingston, and the trees give cover, earthworks are </p><p>being thrown up and guns are being laid. Pres- </p><p>ently the Martians will be coming this way again.” </p><p> And even as I spoke, he sprang to his feet and</p><p>stopped me by a gesture. </p><p> "Listen!” he said. . . .</p><p> From beyond the low hills across the water came</p><p>the dull resonance of distant guns and a remote, </p><p>weird crying. Then everything was still. A cock- </p><p>chafer came droning over the hedge and past us. </p><p>High in the west the crescent moon hung faint and </p><p>pale, above the smoke of Weybridge and Shepper- </p><p>ton and the hot still splendor of the sunset. </p><p> “We had better follow this path,” I said, “north-</p><p>ward.” </p><p>CHAPTER XIV </p><p>In London </p><p>MY younger brother was in London when the </p><p>Martians fell at Woking. He was a medi- </p><p>cal student, working for an imminent ex- </p><p>amination, and he heard nothing of the arrival until </p><p>Saturday morning. The morning papers on Satur- </p><p>day contained, in addition to lengthy special articles </p><p>on the planet Mars, on life in the planets, and so </p><p>forth, a brief and vaguely-worded telegram, all the</p><p>more striking for its brevity. </p><p> The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a</p><p>444 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>crowd, had killed a number of people with a quick- </p><p>firing gun, so the story ran. The telegram con- </p><p>cluded with the words: “Formidable as they seem </p><p>to be, the Martians have not moved from the pit </p><p>into which they have fallen, and, indeed, seem in- </p><p>capable of doing so. Probably this is due to the </p><p>relative strength of the earth’s gravitational en- </p><p>ergy.” On that last text the leader-writers ex- </p><p>panded very comfortingly. </p><p> Of course, all the students in the crammer’s biol-</p><p>ogy class, to which my brother went that day, were </p><p>intensely interested, but there were no signs of any </p><p>unusual excitement in the streets. The afternoon </p><p>papers puffed scraps of news under big headlines. </p><p>They had nothing to tell beyond the movements of </p><p>troops about the common, and the burning of the </p><p>pine-woods between Woking and Weybridge, until </p><p>eight. Then the St. James’s Gazette, in an extra </p><p>special edition, announced the bare fact of the in- </p><p>terruption of telegraphic communication. This was </p><p>thought to be due to the falling of burning pine- </p><p>trees across the line. Nothing more of the fighting </p><p>was known that night, the night of my drive to </p><p>Leatherhead and back. </p><p> My brother felt no anxiety about us, as he knew</p><p>from the description in the papers that the cylinder </p><p>was a good two miles from my house. He made up </p><p>his mind to run down that night to me, in order, as </p><p>he says, to see the things before they were killed. </p><p>He despatched a telegram, which never reached me, </p><p>about four o’clock, and spent the evening at a music- </p><p>hall. </p><p> In London, also, on Saturday night there was a</p><p>thunderstorm, and my brother reached Waterloo in </p><p>a cab. On the platform from which the midnight </p><p>train usually starts he learnt, after some waiting, </p><p>that an accident prevented trains from reaching </p><p>Woking that night. The nature of the accident he </p><p>could not ascertain; indeed, the railway authorities </p><p>did not clearly know at that time. There was very </p><p>little excitement in the station, as the officials, fail- </p><p>ing to realize that anything further than a break- </p><p>down between Byfleet and Woking Junction had oc- </p><p>curred, were running the theatre trains, which us- </p><p>ually passed through Woking, round by Virginia </p><p>Water or Guildford. They were busy making the </p><p>necessary arrangements to alter the route of the </p><p>Southampton and Portsmouth Sunday League ex- </p><p>cursions. A nocturnal newspaper reporter, mistak- </p><p>ing my brother for the traffic manager, whom he </p><p>does to a slight extent resemble, waylaid and tried </p><p>to interview him. Few people, excepting the rail-</p><p>way officials, connected the breakdown with the </p><p>Martians. </p><p> I have read, in another account of these events,</p><p>that on Sunday morning “all London was electrified </p><p>by the news from Woking.” As a matter of fact, </p><p>there was nothing to justify that very extravagant </p><p>phrase. Plenty of people in London did not hear of </p><p>the Martians until the panic of Monday morning. </p><p>Those who did took some time to realize all that the </p><p>hastily-worded telegrams in the Sunday papers con- </p><p>veyed. The majority of people in London do not </p><p>read Sunday papers. </p><p> The habit of personal security, moreover, is so</p><p>deeply fixed in the Londoner’s mind, and startling </p><p>intelligence so much a matter of course in the </p><p>papers, that they could read without any personal </p><p>tremors: “About seven o’clock last night the Mar- </p><p>tians came out of the cylinder, and, moving about </p><p>under an armor of metallic shields, have completely </p><p>wrecked Woking Station, with the adjacent houses, </p><p>and massacred an entire battalion of the Cardigan </p><p>Regiment. No details are known. Maxims have </p><p>been absolutely useless against their armor; the </p><p>field-guns have been disabled by them. Flying hus- </p><p>sars have bepn galloping into Chertsey. The Mar- </p><p>tians appear to be moving slowly towards Chertsey </p><p>or Windsor. Great anxiety prevails in West Surrey, </p><p>and earthworks are being thrown up to check the </p><p>advance Londonwards." That was how the Sunday </p><p>Sun put it, and a clever and remarkably prompt </p><p>“hand-book” article in the Referee compared the </p><p>affair to a menagerie suddenly let loose in a village. </p><p> No one in London knew positively of the nature</p><p>of the armored Martians, and there was still a fixed </p><p>idea that these monsters must be sluggish: “crawl- </p><p>ing,” “creeping painfully”—such expressions occur- </p><p>red in almost all the earlier reports. None of the </p><p>telegrams could have been written by an eye-witness </p><p>of their advance. The Sunday papers printed sep- </p><p>arate editions as further news came to hand, some </p><p>even in default of it. But there was practically </p><p>nothing more to tell people until late in the after- </p><p>noon, when the authorities gave the press agencies </p><p>the news in their possession. It was stated that the </p><p>people of Walton and Weybridge, and all that dis- </p><p>trict, were pouring along the roads Londonward, </p><p>and that was all. </p><p>lyY brother went to church at the Foundling </p><p>Hospital in the morning, still in ignorance of </p><p>what had happened on the previous night There </p><p>he heard allusions made to the invasion, and a spe- </p><p>cial prayer for peace. Coming out. he bought a </p><p>Referee. He became alarmed at the news in this,</p><p>and went again to Waterloo Station to find out if </p><p>communication were restored. The omnibuses, car- </p><p>riages, cyclists, and innumerable people walking in </p><p>their best clothes, seemed scarcely affected by the </p><p>strange intelligence that the newsvendors were dis- </p><p>seminating. People were interested, or, if alarmed, </p><p>alarmed only on account of the local residents. At </p><p>the station he heard for the first time that the </p><p>Windsor and Chertsey lines were now interrupted. </p><p>The porters told him that several remarkable tele- </p><p>grams had been received in the morning from By- </p><p>fleet and Chertsey Stations, but that these had </p><p>abruptly ceased. My brother could get very little </p><p>precise detail out of them. “There’s fighting going </p><p>on about Weybridge,” was the extent of their infor- </p><p>mation. </p><p> The train service was now very much disorgan-</p><p>ized. Quite a number of people, who had been ex- </p><p>pecting friends from places on the South-Western </p><p>network, were standing about the station. One </p><p>gray-headed old gentleman came and abused the </p><p>South-Western Company bitterly to my brother. </p><p>“It wants showing up,” he said. </p><p> One or two trains came in from Richmond, Put-</p><p>ney, and Kingston, containing people who had gone </p><p>out for a day’s boating, and found the locks closed </p><p>and a feeling of panic in the air. A man in a blue </p><p>THE WAR OF THE WORLDS </p><p>445 </p><p>and white blazer addressed my brother, full of </p><p>strange tidings. </p><p> "There's hosts of people driving into Kingston in</p><p>traps and carts and things, with boxes of valuables </p><p>and all that,” he said. “They come from Molesey </p><p>and Weybridge and Walton, and they say there's </p><p>been guns heard at Chertsey, heavy firing, and that </p><p>mounted soldiers have told them to get off at once </p><p>because the Martians are coming. We heard guns </p><p>firing at Hampton Court Station, but we thought </p><p>it was thunder. What the dickens does it all mean? </p><p>The Martians can’t get out of their pit, can they?” </p><p> My brother could not tell him.</p><p> Afterwards he found that the vague feeling of</p><p>alarm had spread to the clients of the underground </p><p>railway, and that the Sunday excursionists began </p><p>to return from all the South-Western “lungs”— </p><p>Barnes, Wimbledon, Richmond Park, Kew, and so </p><p>forth—at unnaturally early hours but not a soul </p><p>had anything but vague hearsay to tell of. Every- </p><p>one connected with the terminus seemed ill-tem- </p><p>pered. </p><p> About five o’clock the gathering crowd in the sta-</p><p>tion was immensely excited by the opening of the </p><p>line of communication, which is almost invariably </p><p>closed, between the South-Eastern and the South- </p><p>Western stations, and the passage of carriage- </p><p>trucks bearing huge guns, and carriages crammed </p><p>with soldiers. These were the guns that were </p><p>brought up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover </p><p>Kingston. There was an exchange of pleasantries: </p><p>"You’ll get eaten!” “We’re the beast-tamers!” and </p><p>so forth. A little while after that a squad of police </p><p>came into the station, and began to clear the public </p><p>off the platforms, and my brother went out into the </p><p>street again. </p><p> The church bells were ringing for evensong, and</p><p>a squad of Salvation Army lasses came singing </p><p>down Waterloo Road. On the bridge a number of </p><p>loafers were watching a curious brown scum that </p><p>came drifting down the stream in patches. The sun </p><p>was just setting, and the Clock Tower and the </p><p>Houses of Parliament rose against one of the most </p><p>peaceful skies it is possible to imagine, a sky of </p><p>gold, barred with long transverse stripes of reddish- </p><p>purple cloud. There was talk of a floating body. </p><p>One of the men there, a reservist he said he was, </p><p>told my brother he had seen the heliograph flicker- </p><p>ing in the west. </p><p> In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of</p><p>sturdy roughs, who had just rushed out of Fleet </p><p>Street with still wet newspapers and staring plac- </p><p>ards. “Dreadful catastrophe!” they bawled one to </p><p>the other dpwn Wellington Street. “Fighting at </p><p>Weybridge! Full description! Repulse of the Mar- </p><p>tians! London said to be in danger!” He had to </p><p>give threepence for a copy of that paper. </p><p> Then it was, and then only, that he realized some-</p><p>thing of the full power and terror of these mon- </p><p>sters. He learnt that they were not merely a hand- </p><p>ful of small sluggish creatures, but that they were </p><p>minds swaying vast mechanical bodies, and that </p><p>they could move swiftly and smite with such power </p><p>that even the mightiest guns could not stand against </p><p>them. </p><p> They were described as “vast spider-like ma-</p><p>chines, nearly a hundred feet high, capable of the </p><p>speed of an express train, and able to shoot out a </p><p>beam of intense heat.” Masked batteries, chiefly </p><p>of field-guns, had been planted in the country about </p><p>Horsell Common, and especially between the Woking </p><p>district and London. Five of the machines had </p><p>been seen moving towards the Thames, and one, by </p><p>a freak of chance, had been destroyed. In the other </p><p>cases the shells had missed, and the batteries had </p><p>been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays. Heavy </p><p>losses of soldiers were mentioned, but the tone of </p><p>the despatch was optimistic. </p><p> The Martians had been repulsed; they were not</p><p>invulnerable. They had retreated to their triangle </p><p>of cylinders again, in the circle about Woking. Sig- </p><p>nallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon </p><p>them from all sides. Guns were in rapid transit </p><p>from Windsor, Portsmouth, Aldershot, Woolwich— </p><p>even from the north; among others, long wire guns </p><p>of ninety-five tons from Woolwich. Altogether one </p><p>hundred and sixteen were in position or being hast- </p><p>ily laid, chiefly covering London. Never before in </p><p>England had there been such a vast or i apid concen- </p><p>tration of military material. </p><p> Any further cylinders that fell, it was hoped,</p><p>could be destroyed at once by high explosives, which </p><p>were being rapidly manufactured and distributed. </p><p>No doubt, ran the report, the situation was of the </p><p>strangest and gravest description, but the public </p><p>was exhorted to avoid and discourage panic. No </p><p>doubt the Martians were strange and terrible in </p><p>the extreme, but at the outside there could not be </p><p>more than twenty of them against our millions. </p><p> The authorities had reason to suppose, from the</p><p>size of tho cylinders, that at che outside there could</p><p>not be more than five in each cylinder—fifteen al- </p><p>together. And one at least was disposed of—per- </p><p>haps more. The public would be fairly warned of </p><p>the approach of danger, and elaborate measures </p><p>were being taken for the protection of the people in </p><p>the threatened south-western suburbs. And so, with </p><p>reiterated assurances of the safety of London, and </p><p>the confidence of the authorities to cope with the </p><p>difficulty, this quasi proclamation closed. </p><p>THIS was printed in enormous type, so fresh that </p><p>the paper was still wet, and there had been no </p><p>time to add a word of comment. It was curious, my </p><p>brother said, to see how ruthlessly the other con- </p><p>tents of the paper had been hacked and taken out </p><p>to give this place. </p><p> All down Wellington Street, people could be seen</p><p>fluttering out the pink sheets and reading, and the </p><p>Strand was suddenly noisy with the voices of an </p><p>army of hawkers following these pioneers. Men </p><p>came scrambling off buses to secure copies. Cer- </p><p>tainly this news excited people intensely, whatever </p><p>their previous apathy. The shutters of a map-shop </p><p>in the Strand were being taken down, my brother </p><p>said, and a man in his Sunday raiment, lemon-yel- </p><p>low gloves even, was visible inside the window, hast- </p><p>ily fastening maps of Surrey to the glass. </p><p> Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square,</p><p>the paper in his hand, my brother saw some of the </p><p>fugitives from West Surrey. There was a man driv- </p><p>ing a cart such as greengrocers use, and his wife </p><p>and two boys and some articles of furniture. He </p><p>was driving from the direction of Westminster </p><p>446 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>Bridge, and close behind him came a hay wagon </p><p>with five or six respectable-looking people in it, and </p><p>some boxes and bundles. The faces of these people </p><p>were haggard, and their entire appearance con- </p><p>trasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best ap- </p><p>pearance of the people on the omnibuses. People in </p><p>fashionable clothing peeped at them out of cabs. </p><p>They stopped at the Square as if undecided which </p><p>way to take, and finally turned eastward along the </p><p>Strand. Some way after these came a man in work-, </p><p>day clothes, riding one of those old-fashioned tri- </p><p>cycles with a small front-wheel. He was dirty and </p><p>white in the face. </p><p> My brother turned down towards Victoria, and met</p><p>a number of such people. He had a vague idea that </p><p>he might see something of me. He noticed an un- </p><p>usual number of police regulating the traffic. Some </p><p>of the refugees were exchanging news with the </p><p>people on the omnibuses. One was professing to </p><p>have seen the Martians. "Boilers on stilts, I tell </p><p>you, striding along like men.” Most of them were </p><p>excited and animated by their strange experience. </p><p> Beyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a</p><p>lively trade with these arrivals. At all the street </p><p>corners groups of people were reading papers, talk- </p><p>ing excitedly, or staring at these unusual Sunday </p><p>visitors. They seemed to increase as night drew on, </p><p>until at last the roads, my brother said, were like </p><p>the Epsom High Street on a Derby Day. My brother </p><p>addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatis- </p><p>factory answers from most. </p><p> None of them could tell him any news of Woking</p><p>except one man, who assured him that Woking had </p><p>been entirely destroyed on the previous night. </p><p> “I come from Byfleet,” he said; “a man on a bi-</p><p>cycle came through the place in the early morning, </p><p>and ran from door to door warning us to come away. </p><p>Then came soldiers. We went out to look, and there </p><p>were clouds of smoke to the south—nothing but </p><p>smoke, and not a soul coming that way. Then we </p><p>heard the guns at Chertsey, and folks coming from </p><p>Weybridge. So Pve locked up my house and come </p><p>on.” </p><p> At that time there was a strong feeling in the</p><p>streets that the authorities were to blame for their </p><p>incapacity to dispose of the invaders without all this </p><p>inconvenience. </p><p> About eight o’clock, a noise of heavy firing was</p><p>distinctly audible all over the south of London. My</p><p>brother could not hear it for the traffic in the main </p><p>streets, but by striking through the quiet back- </p><p>streets to the river he was able to distinguish it </p><p>quite plainly. </p><p> He walked back from Westminster to his apart-</p><p>ments near Regent's Park about two. He was now </p><p>very anxious on my account, and disturbed at the </p><p>evident magnitude of the trouble. His mind was </p><p>inclined to run, even as mine had run on Saturday, </p><p>on military details. He thought of all those silent </p><p>expectant guns, of the suddenly nomadic country- </p><p>side; he tried to imagine “boilers on stilts” a hun- </p><p>dred feet high. </p><p> There were one or two cartloads of refugees pass-</p><p>ing along Oxford Street, and several in the Maryle- </p><p>bone Road, but so slowly was the news spreading </p><p>that Regent Street and Portland Road were full of </p><p>their usual Sunday night promenaders, albeit they </p><p>talked in groups, and along the edge of Regent’s </p><p>Park there were as many silent couples “walking </p><p>out” together under the scattered gas-lamps as ever </p><p>there had been. The night was warm and still, and </p><p>a little oppressive, the sound of guns continued in- </p><p>termittently, and after midnight there seemed to </p><p>be sheet lightning in the south. </p><p> He read and re-read the paper, fearing the worst</p><p>had happened to me. He was restless, and after </p><p>supper prowled out again aimlessly. He returned </p><p>and tried to divert his attention by his examination </p><p>notes in vain. He went to bed a little after mid- </p><p>night, and he was awakened out of some lurid </p><p>dreams in the small hours of Monday by the sound </p><p>of door-knockers, feet running in the street, distant </p><p>drumming, and a clamor of bells. Red reflections </p><p>danced on the ceiling. For a moment he lay aston- </p><p>ished, wondering whether day had come or the </p><p>world had gone mad. Then he jumped out of bed </p><p>and ran to the window. </p><p> His room was an attic, and as he thrust his head</p><p>out, up and down the street there were a dozen </p><p>echoes to the noise of his window-sash, and heads </p><p>in every kind of night disarray appeared. In- </p><p>quiries were being shouted. “They are coming!” </p><p>bawled a policeman, hammering at the door; “the </p><p>Martians are coming!” and hurried to the next </p><p>door. </p><p> The noise of drumming and trumpeting came</p><p>from the Albany Street Barracks, and every church </p><p>within earshot was hard at work killing sleep with </p><p>a vehement disorderly tocsin. There was a noise </p><p>of doors opening, and window after window in the </p><p>houses opposite flashed from darkness into yellow</p><p>illumination. </p><p> Up the street came galloping a closed carriage,</p><p>bursting abruptly into noise at the corner, rising </p><p>to a clattering climax under the window, and dying </p><p>away slowly in the distance. Close on the rear of </p><p>this came a couple of cabs, the forerunners of a </p><p>long procession of flying vehicles, going for the </p><p>most part to Chalk Farm Station, where the North- </p><p>Western special trains were loading up, instead </p><p>of coming down the gradient into Euston. </p><p>TT'OR a long time my brother stared out of the </p><p>A window in blank astonishment, watching the </p><p>policemen hammering at door after door, and de- </p><p>livering their incomprehensible message. Then the </p><p>door behind him opened, and the man who lodged </p><p>across the landing came in, dressed only in shirt, </p><p>trousers, and slippers, his braces loose about his </p><p>waist, his hair disordered from his pillow. </p><p> “What the devil is it?” he asked. “A fire? What</p><p>a devil of a row!” </p><p> They both craned their heads out of the window,</p><p>straining to hear what the policemen were shout- </p><p>ing. People were coming out of the side-streets, </p><p>and standing in groups at the corners talking. </p><p> "What the devil is it all about?” said my broth-</p><p>er's fellow-lodger. </p><p> My brother answered him vaguely and began to</p><p>dress, running with each garment to the window </p><p>in order to miss nothing of the growing excite- </p><p>ment of the streets. And presently men selling </p><p>unnaturally early newspapers came bawling into </p><p>the street: </p><p>THE WAR OF THE WORLDS </p><p>447 </p><p> “London in danger of suffocation! The Kings-</p><p>ton and Richmond defences forced! Fearful </p><p>massacres in the Thames Valley!” </p><p> And all about him—in the rooms below, in the</p><p>houses on either side and across the road, and </p><p>behind in the Park Terraces and in the hundred </p><p>other streets of that part of Marylebone, and the </p><p>Westbourne Park district and St. Pancras, and </p><p>westward and northward in Kilburn and St. John’s </p><p>Wood and Hampstead, and eastward in Shoreditch </p><p>and Highbury and Haggerston and Hoxton, and </p><p>indeed, through all the vastness of London from </p><p>Ealing to East Ham—people were rubbing their </p><p>eyes, and opening windows to stare out and ask </p><p>aimless questions, and dressing hastily as the first </p><p>breath of the coming storm of Fear blew through </p><p>the streets. It was the dawn of the great panic. </p><p>London, which had gone to bed on Sunday night </p><p>stupid and inert, was awakened in the small hours </p><p>of Monday morning to a vivid sense of danger. </p><p> Unable from his window to learn what was hap-</p><p>pening, my brother went down and out into the </p><p>street, just as the sky between the parapets of </p><p>the houses grew pink with the early dawn. The </p><p>flying people on foot and in vehicles grew more </p><p>numerous every moment. “Black Smoke!” he </p><p>heard people crying, and again “Black Smoke!" </p><p>The contagion of such a unanimous fear was in- </p><p>evitable. As my brother hesitated on the door- </p><p>step, he saw another newsvendor approaching him, </p><p>and got a copy forthwith. The man was running </p><p>away with the rest, and selling his papers as he </p><p>ran, for a shilling each—a grotesque mingling of </p><p>profit and panic. </p><p> And from this paper my brother read that catas-</p><p>trophic despatch of the Commander-in-Chief: </p><p> “The Martians are able to discharge enormous</p><p>clouds of a black and poisonous vapour by means </p><p>of rockets. They have smothered our batteries, </p><p>destroyed Richmond, Kingston, and Wimbledon, </p><p>and are advancing slowly towards London, destroy- </p><p>ing everything on the way. It is impossible to </p><p>stop them. There is no safety from the Black </p><p>Smoke but in instant flight.” </p><p> That was all, but it was enough. Thp whole</p><p>population of the great six-million city was stir- </p><p>ring, slipping, running; presently it would be pour- </p><p>ing eti masse northward. </p><p> “Black Smoke!” the voices cried. “Fire!”</p><p> The bells of the neighboring church made a</p><p>jangling tumult, a cart carelessly driven smashed </p><p>amidst shrieks and curses against the water-trough </p><p>up the street. Sickly yellow light went to and fro </p><p>in the houses, and some of the passing cabs flaunted </p><p>unextinguished lamps. And overhead the dawn </p><p>was growing brighter, clear and steady and calm. </p><p> He heard footsteps running to and fro in the</p><p>rooms, and up and down stairs behind him. His </p><p>landlady came to the door, loosely wrapped in dress- </p><p>ing-gown and shawl; her husband followed, ejacu- </p><p>lating. </p><p> As my brother began to realize the import of</p><p>all these things, he turned hastily to his own room, </p><p>put all his available money—some ten pounds alto- </p><p>gether—into his pockets, and went out again into </p><p>the streets. </p><p>CHAPTER XV </p><p>What Had Happened in Surrey </p><p>IT was while the curate had sat and talked so </p><p>wildly to me under the hedge in the flat </p><p>meadows near Halliford, and while my brother </p><p>was watching the fugitives stream over Westminster </p><p>Bridge, that the Martians had resumed the offen- </p><p>sive. So far as one can ascertain from the con- </p><p>flicting accounts that have been put forth, the </p><p>majority of them remained busied with prepara- </p><p>tions in the Horsell pit until nine that night, hurry- </p><p>ing on some operation that disengaged huge vol- </p><p>umes of green smoke. </p><p> But three certainly came out about eight o’clock</p><p>and, advancing slowly and cautiously, made their </p><p>way through Byfleet and Pyrford towards Ripley </p><p>and Weybridge, and so came in sight of the ex- </p><p>pectant batteries against the setting sun. These </p><p>Martians did not advance in a body, but in a line, </p><p>each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest </p><p>fellow. They communicated with each other by </p><p>means of siren-like howls, running up and down </p><p>the scale from one note to another. </p><p> It was this howling and the firing of the guns</p><p>at Ripley and St. George’s Hill that we had heard </p><p>at Upper Halliford. The Ripley gunners, unsea- </p><p>soned artillery volunteers who ought never to have </p><p>been placed in such a position, fired one wild, pre- </p><p>mature, ineffectual volley, and bolted on horse and </p><p>foot through the deserted village, and the Martian </p><p>walked over their guns serenely without using </p><p>his Heat-Ray, stepped gingerly among them, passed</p><p>in front of them, and so came unexpectedly upon </p><p>the guns in Painshill Park, which he destroyed. </p><p> The St. George’s Hill men, however, were better</p><p>led or of a better mettle. Hidden by a pine-wood </p><p>as they were, they seem to have been quite unex- </p><p>pected by the Martian nearest to them. They laid </p><p>their guns as deliberately as if they had been on </p><p>parade, and fired at about a thousand yards’ range. </p><p> The shells flashed all round the Martian, and</p><p>they saw him advance a few paces, stagger, and go </p><p>down. Everybody yelled together, and the guns </p><p>were reloaded in frantic haste. The overthrown </p><p>Martian set up a prolonged ululation, and imme- </p><p>diately a second glittering giant, answering him, </p><p>appeared over the trees to the south. It would </p><p>seem that a leg of the tripod had been smashed by </p><p>one of the shells. The whole of the second volley </p><p>flew wide of the Martian on the ground, and simul- </p><p>taneously both his companions brought their Heat- </p><p>Rays to bear on the battery. The ammunition </p><p>blew up. the pine-trees all about the guns flashed </p><p>into fire, and only one or two of the men who were </p><p>already running over the crest of the hill escaped. </p><p> After this it would seem that the three took</p><p>counsel together and halted, and the scouts who </p><p>were watching them report that they remained </p><p>absolutely stationary for the next half-hour. The </p><p>Martian who had been overthrown crawled tedi- </p><p>ously out of his hood, a small brown figure, oddly </p><p>suggestive from that distance of a speck of light, </p><p>and apparently engaged in the repair of his sup- </p><p>448 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>port. About nine he had finished, for his cowl </p><p>was then seen above the trees again. </p><p> It was a few minutes past nine that night when</p><p>these three sentinels were joined by four other </p><p>Martians, each carrying a thick black tube. A </p><p>similar tube was handed to each of the three, and </p><p>the seven proceeded to distribute themselves at </p><p>equal distances along a curved line between St. </p><p>George’s Hill, Weybridge, and the village of Send, </p><p>south-west of Ripley. </p><p> A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before</p><p>them so soon as they began to move, and warned </p><p>the waiting batteries about Ditton and Esher. At </p><p>*he same time four of their Fighting Machines, </p><p>imilarly armed with tubes, crossed the river, and </p><p>two of them, black against the western sky, came </p><p>into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried </p><p>wearily and painfully along the road that runs </p><p>northward out of Halliford. They moved, as it </p><p>seemed to us, upon a cloud, for a milky mist cov- </p><p>ered the fields and rose to a third of their height. </p><p> At this sight the curate cried faintly in his</p><p>throat, and began running; but I knew it was no </p><p>good running from a Martian, and I turned aside </p><p>and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles </p><p>into the broad ditch by the side of the road. He </p><p>looked back, saw what I was doing, and turned </p><p>to join me. </p><p> The two Martians halted, the nearer to us stand-</p><p>ing and facing Sunbury, the remoter being a gray </p><p>indistinctness towards the evening star, away to- </p><p>wards Staines. </p><p>THE occasional howling of the Martians had </p><p>ceased; they took up their positions in the </p><p>huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute </p><p>silence. It was a crescent with twelve miles be- </p><p>tween its horns. Never since the devising of gun- </p><p>powder was the beginning of a battle so still. To </p><p>us and to an observer about Ripley it would have </p><p>had precisely the same effect—the Martians seemed </p><p>in solitary possession of the darkling night, lit only </p><p>as it was by the slender moon, the stars, the after- </p><p>glow of the daylight, and the ruddy glare from St. </p><p>George’s Hill and the woods of Painshill. </p><p> But facing that crescent everywhere, at Staines,</p><p>Hounslow, Ditton, Esher, Ockham, behind hills and </p><p>woods south of the river and across the flat grass </p><p>meadoWS to the north of it, wherever a cluster of </p><p>trees or village houses gave sufficient cover, the</p><p>guns were waiting. The signal rockets burst and </p><p>rained their sparks through the night and vanished, </p><p>and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose </p><p>to a tense expectation. The Martians had but to </p><p>advance into the line of fire, and instantly those </p><p>motionless black forms of men, those guns glitter- </p><p>ing so darkly in the early night, would explode into </p><p>a thunderous fury of battle. </p><p> No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a</p><p>thousand of those vigilant minds, even as it was </p><p>uppermost in mine, was the riddle how much they </p><p>understood of us. Did they grasp that we in our </p><p>millions were organized, disciplined, working to- </p><p>gether? Or did they interpret our spurts of fire, </p><p>the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady in- </p><p>vestment of their encampment, as we should the </p><p>furious unanimity of onslaught in a disturbed hive </p><p>of bees? Did they dream they might exterminate </p><p>us? (At that time no one knew what food they </p><p>needed.) A hundred such questions struggled to- </p><p>gether in my mind as I watched that vast sentinel </p><p>shape. And in the back of my mind was the sense </p><p>of all the huge unknown and hidden forces London- </p><p>ward. Had they prepared pitfalls? Were the </p><p>powder-mills at Hounslow ready as a snare? Would </p><p>the Londoners have the heart and courage to make </p><p>a greater Moscow of their mighty province of </p><p>houses? </p><p> Then, after an interminable time as it seemed</p><p>to us, crouching and peering through the hedge, </p><p>came a sound like the distant concussion of a gun. </p><p>Another nearer, and then another. And then the </p><p>Martian beside us raised his tube on high and dis- </p><p>charged it gunwise, with a heavy report that made </p><p>the ground heave. The Martian towards Staines </p><p>answered him. There was no flash, no smoke, </p><p>simply that loaded detonation. </p><p> I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns fol-</p><p>lowing one another that I so far forgot my per- </p><p>sonal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber up </p><p>into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury. As I </p><p>did so a second report followed, and a big projectile </p><p>hurtled overhead towards Hounslow. I expected at </p><p>least to see smoke or fire or some such evidence </p><p>of its work. But all I saw was the deep-blue sky </p><p>above, with one solitary star, and the white mist </p><p>spreading wide and low beneath. And there had </p><p>been no crash, no answering explosion. The silence </p><p>was restored ; the minute lengthened to three. </p><p> “What has happened?” said the curate, standing</p><p>up beside me. </p><p> “Heaven knows!” said I.</p><p> A bat flickered by and vanished. A distant tumult</p><p>of shouting began and ceased. I looked again at </p><p>the Martian, and saw he was now moving eastward </p><p>along the river-bank, with a swift rolling motion. </p><p> Every moment I expected the fire of some hidden</p><p>battery to spring upon him; but the evening calm </p><p>was unbroken. The figure of the Martian grew </p><p>smaller as he receded, and presently the mist and </p><p>the gathering night had swallowed him up. By a </p><p>common impulse we clambered higher. Towards </p><p>Sunbury was a dark appearance, as though a coni- </p><p>cal hill had suddenly come into being there, hiding </p><p>our view of the further country; and then, re- </p><p>moter across the river, over Walton, we saw an- </p><p>other such summit. These hill-like forms grew </p><p>lower and broader even as we stared. </p><p> Moved by a sudden thought, I looked northward,</p><p>and there I perceived a third of these cloudy black </p><p>kopjes had arisen. </p><p> Everything had suddenly become very still. Far</p><p>away to the south-east, marking the quiet, we </p><p>heard the Martians hooting to one another, and </p><p>then the air quivered again with the distant thud </p><p>of their guns. But the earthly artillery made no </p><p>reply. </p><p> Now, at the time we could not understand these</p><p>things; but later I was to learn the meaning of </p><p>these ominous kopjes that gathered in the twilight. </p><p>Each of the Martians, standing in the great cres- </p><p>cent I have described, had discharged at some un- </p><p>known signal, by means of the gun-like tube he </p><p>carried, a huge canister over whatever hill, copse, </p><p>THE WAR OF THE WORLDS </p><p>449 </p><p>cluster of houses, or other possible cover for guns, </p><p>chanced to be in front of him. Some fired only one </p><p>of these, some two, as in the case of the one we </p><p>had seen; the one at Ripley is said to have dis- </p><p>charged no fewer than five at that time. These </p><p>canisters smashed on striking the ground—they did </p><p>not explode—and incontinently disengaged an </p><p>enormous volume of a heavy inky vapour, coiling </p><p>and pouring upwards in a huge and ebony cumulus </p><p>cloud, a gaseous hill that sank and spread itself </p><p>slowly over the surrounding country. And the </p><p>touch of that vapour, the inhaling of its pungent </p><p>wisps, was death to all that breathes. </p><p> It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the</p><p>densest smoke, so that, after the first tumultuous </p><p>uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank down </p><p>through the air and poured over the ground in a </p><p>manner rather liquid than gaseous, abandoning </p><p>the hills, and streaming into the valleys and ditches </p><p>and water-courses, even as I have heard the car- </p><p>bonic acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is </p><p>wont to do. And where it came upon water some </p><p>chemical action occurred, and the surface would be </p><p>instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank </p><p>slowly and made way for more. The scum was </p><p>absolutely insoluble, and it is a strange thing, see- </p><p>ing the instant effect of the gas, that one could </p><p>drink the water from which it had been strained </p><p>without hurt. The vapour did not diffuse as a true </p><p>gas would do. It hung together in banks, flowing </p><p>sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving </p><p>reluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it </p><p>combined with the mist and moisture of the air, </p><p>and sank to the earth in the form of dust. Save </p><p>that an unknown element giving a group of four </p><p>lines in the blue of the spectrum is concerned, we </p><p>are still entirely ignorant of the nature of this </p><p>substance. </p><p> Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion</p><p>was over, the black smoke clung so closely to the </p><p>ground, even before its precipitation, that, fifty </p><p>feet up in the air, on the roofs and upper stories </p><p>of high houses and on great trees, there was a </p><p>chance of escaping its poison altogether, as was </p><p>proved even that night at Street Cobham and </p><p>Ditton. </p><p>THE man who escaped at the former place tells </p><p>a wonderful story'of the strangeness of its </p><p>coiling flow, and how he looked down from the </p><p>church spire and saw the houses of the village </p><p>rising like ghosts out of its inky nothingness. For </p><p>a day and a half he remained there, weary, starv-</p><p>ing, and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue </p><p>sky and against the prospect of the distant hills </p><p>a velvet black expanse, with red roofs, green trees, </p><p>and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates, barns, </p><p>outhouses, and walls, rising here and there into </p><p>the sunlight. </p><p> But that was at Street Cobham where the black</p><p>vapour was allowed to remain until it sank of its </p><p>own accord into the ground. As a rule, the Mar- </p><p>tians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the </p><p>air of it again by wading into it and directing a </p><p>jet of steam upon it. </p><p> That they did with the vapour-banks near us,</p><p>as we saw in the starlight from the window of a </p><p>deserted house at Upper Halliford, whither we had </p><p>returned. From there we could see the search- </p><p>lights on Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill going to </p><p>and fro, and about eleven the window rattled and </p><p>we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that </p><p>had been put in position there. These continued </p><p>intermittently for the space of a quarter of an </p><p>hour, sending chance shots at the invisible Mar- </p><p>tians at Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale </p><p>beams of the electric light vanished, and were </p><p>replaced by a bright red glow. </p><p> Then the fourth cylinder fell—a brilliant green</p><p>meteor—as I learnt afterwards, in Bushey Park. </p><p>Before the guns on the Richmond and Kingston </p><p>line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far </p><p>away in the south-west, due, I believe, to guns being </p><p>fired haphazard before the black vapour could over- </p><p>whelm the gunners. </p><p> So, setting about it as methodically as men might</p><p>smoke out a wasps’ nest, the Martians spread this </p><p>strange stifling vapour over the Londonward coun- </p><p>try. The horns of the crescent slowly spread apart, </p><p>until at last they formed a line from Hanwell to </p><p>Coombe and Malden. All night through their de- </p><p>structive tubes advanced. Never once, after the </p><p>Martian at St. George’s Hill was brought down, </p><p>did they give the artillery the ghost of a chance </p><p>against them. Wherever there was a possibility of </p><p>guns being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister </p><p>of the black vapour was discharged, and where the </p><p>guns were openly displayed the Heat-Ray was </p><p>brought to bear. </p><p> By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes</p><p>of Richmond Park, and the glare of Kingston Hill, </p><p>threw their light upon a network of black smoke, </p><p>blotting out the whole Valley of the Thames, and </p><p>extending as far as the eye could reach. And </p><p>through this two Martians slowly waded, and</p><p>turned their hissing steam-jets this way and that. </p><p> The Martians were sparing of the Heat-Ray that</p><p>night, either because they had but a limited supply </p><p>of materia! for its production, or because they did </p><p>not wish to destroy the country, but only to crush </p><p>and overawe the opposition they had aroused. In </p><p>the latter aim they certainly succeeded. Sunday </p><p>night was the end of the organized opposition to </p><p>their movements. After that no body of men could </p><p>stand against them, so hopeless was the enterprise. </p><p>Even the crews of the torpedo boats and destroyers </p><p>that had brought their quick-firers up the Thames </p><p>rpfused to stop, mutinied, and went down again. </p><p>The only offensive operation men ventured upon </p><p>after that night was the preparation of mines and </p><p>pit-falls, and even in that men’s energies were </p><p>frantic and spasmodic. </p><p> One has to imagine the fate of those batteries</p><p>towards Esher, waiting so tensely in the twilight, </p><p>as well as one may. Survivors there were none. </p><p>One may picture the orderly expectation, the offi- </p><p>cers alert and watchful, the gunners ready, the </p><p>ammunition piled to hand, the limber gunners with </p><p>their horses and wagons, the groups of civilian </p><p>spectators standing as near as they were permitted, </p><p>the evening stillness; the ambulances and hospital </p><p>tents, with the burnt and wounded from Wey- </p><p>bridge; then the dull resonance of the shots the </p><p>Martians fired and the clumsy projectile whirling </p><p>450 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>over the trees and houses, and smashing amidst </p><p>the neighboring fields. </p><p> One may picture, too, the sudden shifting of</p><p>the attention, the swiftly spreading coils and </p><p>bellyings of that blackness advancing headlong, </p><p>towering heavenward, turning the twilight to a </p><p>palpable darkness, a strange and horrible antag- </p><p>onist of vapour striding upon its victims, men and </p><p>horses near it seen dimly, running, shrieking, fall- </p><p>ing headlong, shouts of dismay, the guns suddenly </p><p>abandoned, men choking and writhing on the </p><p>ground, and the swift broadening out of the opaque </p><p>cone of smoke. And then, night and extinction— </p><p>nothing but a silent mass of impenetrable vapour </p><p>hiding its dead. </p><p> Before dawn the black vapour was pouring</p><p>through the streets of Richmond, and the disinte- </p><p>grating organism of government was, with a last </p><p>expiring effort, rousing the population of London </p><p>to the necessity of flight. </p><p>End of Part I </p><p>What Do You Know? </p><p>READERS of AMAZING STORIES have frequently commented upon the fact that there is more </p><p>actual knowledge to be gained through reading its pages than from many a textbook.

Near the top the brush grew </p><p>thicker. The look of a rampart grew </p><p>as we approached; it had the air of having been </p><p>deliberately planted by men. We did not wish to </p><p>have to hack our way through the spiky barricade, </p><p>so turned to the right along the front of the green </p><p>wall. After three or four hundred yards we came </p><p>on a clearing which led into the bush, narrowing </p><p>down to what seemed a ______ </p><p>regular passage or track- </p><p>way.

However, I </p><p>thought we had better </p><p>make all the progress we </p><p>could, and so ordered the </p><p>caravan to turn into the </p><p>opening, myself taking </p><p>second place behind the </p><p>guide. </p><p>Suddenly the tracker </p><p>stopped with a guttural </p><p>exclamation. I looked, _ </p><p>and there was one of the	' "</p><p>great African toads, hopping with a certain ponder- </p><p>osity across the path.

After a little, </p><p>a droning sound came to our ears, which we very </p><p>soon set down as that of a human voice. The party </p><p>was halted, and I crept forward with the guide. </p><p>Peeping through the last screen of brush we looked </p><p>down into a hollow and were immeasurably startled </p><p>at what we saw there. The voice proceeded from </p><p>an enormous negro man at least eight feet high, </p><p>the biggest man I had </p><p>ever seen outside a circus. </p><p> was squatting, from</p><p>time to time prostrating </p><p>the forepart of his body, </p><p>and reciting some prayer </p><p>or incantation. The object </p><p>of his devotion was be- </p><p>fore him on the ground; </p><p>it was a small flat piece </p><p>of glass held on a little </p><p>carved ebony stand. By </p><p>his side was a huge spear, </p><p>together with a painted </p><p> ' basket with a lid.</p><p> After a minute or so, the giant bowed down in</p><p>silence, then took up the ebony-and-glass object and </p><p>placed it in the basket. Then to my utter amaze- </p><p>ment he drew out a two-headed toad like the first </p><p>I had seen, but in a cage of woven grass, placed it </p><p>451 </p><p>452 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>on the ground, and proceeded to more genuflection </p><p>and ritual murmurings. As soon as this was over, </p><p>the toad was replaced, and the squatting giant tran- </p><p>quilly regarded the landscape. </p><p> Beyond the hollow or dell lay an undulating coun-</p><p>try, with clumps of bush. A sound in the middle </p><p>distance attracted attention; glimpses of color </p><p>moved through the scrub; and a party of three or </p><p>four dozen men were seen approaching, most of </p><p>them as gigantifc as our first acquaintance. All </p><p>marched in order, armed with great spears, and </p><p>wearing colored loin straps with a sort of sporran, </p><p>it seemed, in front. They were preceded by an in- </p><p>telligent-looking negro of ordinary stature armed </p><p>with a club, and accompanied by two figures more </p><p>remarkable than the giants. They were under-sized, </p><p>almost dwarfish, with huge heads, and enormously </p><p>fat and brawny both in face and body. They wore </p><p>bright yellow cloaks over their black shoulders. </p><p> At sight of them, our giant rose and stood stiffly</p><p>by the side of his basket. The party approached </p><p>and halted. Some order was given, a giant stepped </p><p>out from the ranks towards ours, picked up the </p><p>basket, handed it stiffly to the newcomer, and fell </p><p>into place in the little company. We were clearly </p><p>witnessing some regular routine of relieving guard, </p><p>and I was racking my brains to think what the </p><p>whole thing might signify—guards, giants, dwarfs, </p><p>toads—when to my dismay I heard an exclamation </p><p>at my shoulder. </p><p> It was one of those damned porters, a confounded</p><p>fellow who always liked to show his independence. </p><p>Bored with waiting, I suppose, he had self-impor- </p><p>tautly crept up to see what it was all about, and the </p><p>sudden sight of the company of giants had been too </p><p>much for his nerves. I made a signal to lie quiet, </p><p>but it was too late. The exclamation had been </p><p>heard; the leader gave a quick command, and the </p><p>giants rushed up and out in two groups to sur- </p><p>round us. </p><p> Violence and resistance were clearly out of the</p><p>question. With my heart in my mouth, but with </p><p>as much dignity as I could muster, I jumped up and </p><p>threw out my empty hands, at the same time telling </p><p>the tracker not to shoot. A dozen spears seemed </p><p>towering over me, but none were launched; the </p><p>leader ran up the slope and gave a command. Two </p><p>giants came up and put my hands through their </p><p>arms. The tracker and the porter were herded in </p><p>front at the spear point. The other porters now </p><p>discovered there was something amiss, and began</p><p>to shout and run away, with half the spearmen </p><p>after them. We three were gently but firmly </p><p>marched down and across the hollow. </p><p> I understood nothing of the language, and called</p><p>to my tracker to try his hand. It turned out that </p><p>there was some dialect of which he had a little un- </p><p>derstanding, and we could learn nothing save the </p><p>fact that we were being taken to some superior </p><p>authority. </p><p> For two days we were marched through pleasant</p><p>park-like country, with villages at intervals. Every </p><p>now and then some new monstrosity in the shape of </p><p>a dwarf or an incredibly fat woman or a two-headed </p><p>animal would be visible, until I thought I had </p><p>stumbled on the original source of supply of circus </p><p>freaks. </p><p> The country at last began to slope gently down</p><p>to a pleasant river-valley; and presently we neared </p><p>the capital. It turned out to be a really large town </p><p>for Africa, its mud walls of strangely impressive </p><p>architectural form, with their heavy, slabby but- </p><p>tresses, and giants standing guard upon them. See- </p><p>ing us approach, they shouted, and a crowd poured </p><p>out of the nearest gate. My God, what a crowd! I </p><p>was getting used to giants by this time, but here </p><p>was a regular Barnum and Bailey show; more semi- </p><p>dwarfs; others like them but more so—one could </p><p>not tell whether the creatures were precociously </p><p>mature children or horribly stunted adults; others </p><p>portentously fat, with arms like sooty legs of mut- </p><p>ton, and rolls and volutes of fat crisping out of </p><p>their steatopygous posteriors; still others preco- </p><p>ciously senile and wizened, others hateful and im- </p><p>becile in looks. Of course, there were plenty of </p><p>ordinary negroes too, but enough of the extraordi- </p><p>nary to make one feel pretty queer. Soon after we </p><p>got inside, I suddenly noted something else which </p><p>appeared inexplicable—a telephone wire, with per- </p><p>fectly good insulators, running across from tree to </p><p>tree. A telephone—in an unknown African town. </p><p>I gave it up. </p><p>BUT another surprise was in store for me. I saw </p><p>a figure pass across from one large building to </p><p>another—a figure unmistakably that of a white </p><p>man. In the first place, it was wearing white ducks </p><p>and sun helmet; in the second, it had a pale face. </p><p> He turned at the sound of our cavalcade and</p><p>stood looking a moment; then walked towards us. </p><p> “Halloa!” I shouted. “Do you speak English?”</p><p> “Yes,” he answered, “but keep quiet a moment,”</p><p>and began talking quickly to our leaders, who</p><p>treated him with the greatest deference. He </p><p>dropped back to me and spoke rapidly: “You are </p><p>to be taken into the council hall to be examined: </p><p>but I will see to it that no harm comes to you. This </p><p>is a forbidden land to strangers, and you must be </p><p>prepared to be held up for a time. You will be sent </p><p>down to see me in the temple buildings as soon as </p><p>the formalities are over, and I’ll explain things. </p><p>They want a bit of explaining,” he added with a dry </p><p>laugh. “By the way, my name is I-Iascombe, lately </p><p>research worker at Middlesex Hospital, now relig- </p><p>ious adviser to His Majesty King Mgobe.” He </p><p>laughed again and pushed ahead. He was an inter- </p><p>esting figure—perhaps fifty years old, spare body, </p><p>thin face, with a small beard, and rather sunken, </p><p>hazel eyes. As for his expression, he looked cynical, </p><p>but also as if he were interested in life. </p><p> By this time we were at the entrance to the hall.</p><p>Our giants formed up outside, with my men behind </p><p>them, and only I and the leader passed in. The ex- </p><p>amination was purely formal, and remarkable </p><p>chiefly for the ritual and solemnity which charac- </p><p>terized all the actions of the couple of dozen fine- </p><p>looking men in long robes who were our examiners. </p><p>My men were herded off to some compound. I was </p><p>escorted down to a little hut, furnished with some </p><p>attempt at European style, where I found Has- </p><p>combe. </p><p> As soon as we were alone I was after him with</p><p>my questions. “Now you can tell me. Where are </p><p>we? What is the meaning of all this circus busi- </p><p>THE TISvSUE CULTURE KING </p><p>453 </p><p>ness and this menagerie of monstrosities? And </p><p>how do you come here?” He cut me short. “It's </p><p>a long story, so let me save time by telling it my </p><p>own way.” </p><p> I am not going to tell it as he told it; but will try</p><p>to give a more connected account, the result of </p><p>many later talks with him, and of my own observa- </p><p>tions. </p><p> Hascombe had been a medical student of great</p><p>promise; and after his degree had launched out into </p><p>research. He had first started on parasitic proto- </p><p>zoa, but had given that up in favor of tissue cul- </p><p>ture; from these he had gone off to cancer research, </p><p>and from that to a study of developmental phys- </p><p>iology. Later a big Commission on sleeping sick- </p><p>ness had been organized, and Hascombe, restless </p><p>and eager for travel, had pulled wires and got him- </p><p>self appointed as one of the scientific staff sent to </p><p>Africa. He was much impressed with the view that </p><p>wild game acted as a reservoir for the Trypanosoma </p><p>gambicme. When he learned of the extensive mi- </p><p>grations of game, he saw here an important pos- </p><p>sible means of spreading the disease and asked leave </p><p>to go up country to investigate the whole problem. </p><p>When the Commission as a whole had finished its </p><p>work, he was allowed to stay in Africa with one </p><p>other white man and a company of porters to see </p><p>what he could discover. His white companion was </p><p>a laboratory technician, a taciturn non-commis- </p><p>sioned officer of science called Aggers. </p><p> There is no object in telling of their experiences</p><p>here. Suffice it that they lost their way and fell </p><p>into the hands of this same tribe. That was fifteen </p><p>years ago: and Aggers was now long dead—as the </p><p>result of a wound inflicted when he was caught, </p><p>after a couple of years, trying to escape. </p><p> On their capture, they too had been examined in</p><p>the council chamber, and Hascombe (who had in- </p><p>terested himself in a dilettante way in anthropology </p><p>as in most other subjects of scientific inquiry) was </p><p>much impressed by what he described as the ex- </p><p>ceedingly religious atmosphere. Everything was </p><p>done with an elaboration of ceremony; the chief </p><p>seemed more priest than king, and performed vari- </p><p>ous rites at intervals, and priests were busy at some </p><p>sort of altar the whole time. Among other things, </p><p>he noticed that one of their rites was connected </p><p>with blood. First the chief and then the councillors </p><p>were in turn requisitioned for a drop of vital fluid </p><p>pricked from their finger-tips, and the mixture, held </p><p>in a little vessel, was slowly evaporated over a flame.</p><p> Some of Hascombe’s men spoke a dialect not un-</p><p>like that of their captors, and one was acting as </p><p>interpreter. Things did not look too favorable. The </p><p>country was a “holy place,” it seemed, and the tribe </p><p>a "holy race.” Other Africans who trespassed there, </p><p>if not killed, were enslaved, but for the most part </p><p>they let well alone, and did not trespass. White </p><p>men they had heard of, but never seen till now, and </p><p>the debate was what to do—to kill, let go, or en- </p><p>slave? To let them go was contrary to all their </p><p>principles: the holy place would be defiled if the </p><p>news of it were spread abroad. To enslave them— </p><p>yes; but what were they good for? and the Council </p><p>seemed to feel an instinctive dislike for these other- </p><p>colored creatures. Hascombe had an idea. He </p><p>turned to the interpreter. “Say this: ‘You revere </p><p>the Blood. So do we white men; but we do more— </p><p>we can render visible the blood’s hidden nature and </p><p>reality, and with permission I will show this great </p><p>magic.’ ” He beckoned to the bearer who carried </p><p>his precious microscope, set it up, drew a drop of </p><p>blood from the tip of his finger with his knife, and </p><p>mounted it on a slide under a coverslip. The big- </p><p>wigs were obviously interested. They whispered to </p><p>each other. At length, “Show us,” commanded the </p><p>chief. </p><p>HASCOMBE demonstrated his preparation with </p><p>greater interest than he had ever done to first- </p><p>year medical students in the old days. He explained </p><p>that the blood was composed of little people of vari- </p><p>ous sorts, each with their own lives, and that to spy </p><p>upon them thus gave us new powers over them. </p><p>The elders were more or less impressed. At any </p><p>rate the sight of these thousands of corpuscles </p><p>where they could see nothing before made them </p><p>think, made them realize that the white man had </p><p>power which might make him a desirable servant. </p><p> They would not ask to see their own blood for</p><p>fear that the sight would put them into the power </p><p>of those who saw it. But they had blood drawn </p><p>from a slave. Hascombe asked too for a bird, and </p><p>was able to create a certain interest by showing </p><p>how different were the little people of its blood. </p><p> “Tell them,” he said to the interpreter, “that I</p><p>have many other powers and magics which I will </p><p>show them if they will give me time." </p><p> The long and short of it was that he and his</p><p>party were spared—He said he knew then what one </p><p>felt when the magistrate said: "remanded for a </p><p>week.” </p><p> He had been attracted by one of the elder states-</p><p>men of the tribe—a tall, powerful-looking man of </p><p>middle-age; and was agreeably surprised when this </p><p>man came round next day to see him. Hascombe </p><p>later nicknamed him the Prince-Bishop, for his com- </p><p>bination of the qualities of the statesman and the </p><p>ecclesiastic: his real name was Bugala. He was as </p><p>anxious to discover more about Hascombe’s myste- </p><p>rious powers and resources as Hascombe was to </p><p>learn what he could of the people into whose hands </p><p>he had fallen, and they met almost every evening </p><p>and talked far into the night. </p><p> Bugala’s inquiries were as little prompted as</p><p>Hascombe’s by a purely academic curiosity. Im- </p><p>pressed himself by the microscope, and still more by </p><p>the effect which it had had on his colleagues, he was </p><p>anxious to find out whether by utilizing the powers </p><p>of the white man he could not secure his own ad- </p><p>vancement. At length, they struck a bargain. Bu- </p><p>gala would see to it that no harm befell Hascombe. </p><p>But Hascombe must put his resources and powers </p><p>at the disposal of the Council; and Bugala would </p><p>take good care to arrange matters so that he him- </p><p>self benefited. So far as Hascombe could make out, </p><p>Bugala imagined a radical change in the national </p><p>religion, a sort of reformation based on Hascombe’s </p><p>conjuring tricks; and that he would emerge as the </p><p>High Priest of this changed system. </p><p> Hascombe had a sense of humor, and it was</p><p>tickled. It seemed pretty clear that they could not </p><p>escape, at least for the present. That being so, why </p><p>not take the opportunity of doing a little research </p><p>4vt </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>work at state expense—an opportunity which he </p><p>and his like were always clamoring for at home? </p><p>His thoughts began to run away with him. He </p><p>would find out all he could of the rites and super- </p><p>stitions of the tribe. He would, by the aid of his </p><p>knowledge and his scientific skill, exalt the details </p><p>of these rites, the expression of those superstitions, </p><p>the whole physical side of their religiosity, on to a </p><p>new level which should to them appear truly miracu- </p><p>lous. </p><p> It would not be worth my troubling to tell all the</p><p>negotiations, the false starts, the misunderstand- </p><p>ings. In the end he secured what he wanted—a </p><p>building which could be used as a laboratory; an </p><p>unlimited supply of slaves for the lower and priests </p><p>for the higher duties of laboratory assistants, and </p><p>the promise that when his scientific stores were ex- </p><p>hausted they would do their best to secure others </p><p>from the coast—a promise w!iich was scrupulously </p><p>kept, so that he never went short for lack of what </p><p>money could buy. </p><p> He next applied himself diligently to a study of</p><p>their religion and found that it was built round </p><p>various main motifs. Of these, the central one was </p><p>the belief in the divinity and tremendous impor- </p><p>tance of the Priest-King. The second was a form </p><p>of ancestor-worship. The third was an animal cult, </p><p>in particular of the more grotesque species of the </p><p>African fauna. The fourth was sex, con variazioni. </p><p>Hascombe reflected on these facts. Tissue culture; </p><p>experimental embryology; endocrine treatment; ar- </p><p>tificial parthen6genesis. He laughed and said to </p><p>himself: “Well, at least I can try, and it ought to </p><p>be amusing." </p><p>THAT was how it all started. Pehaps the best </p><p>way of giving some idea of how it had devel- </p><p>oped will be for me to tell my own impressions when </p><p>Hascombe took me round his laboratories. One </p><p>whole quarter of the town was devoted entirely to </p><p>religion—it struck me as excessive, but Hascombe </p><p>reminded me that Tibet spends one-fifth of its rev- </p><p>enues on melted butter to burn before its shrines. </p><p>Facing the main square was the chief temple, built </p><p>impressively enough of solid mud. On either side </p><p>were the apartments where dwelt the servants of </p><p>the gods and administrators of the sacred rites. </p><p>Behind were Hascombe’s laboratories, some built of </p><p>mud, others, under his later guidance, of wood. </p><p>They were guarded night and day by patrols of </p><p>giants, and were arranged in a series of quad- </p><p>rangles. Within one quadrangle'was a pool which </p><p>served as an aquarium; in another, aviaries and</p><p>great hen-houses; in yet another, cages with vari- </p><p>ous animals; in the fourth a little botanic garden. </p><p>Behind were stables with dozens of cattle and sheep, </p><p>and a sort of experimental ward for human beings. </p><p> He took me into the nearest of the buildings.</p><p>“This,” he said, “is known to the people as the Fac- </p><p>tory (it is difficult to give the exact sense of the </p><p>word, but it literally means producing-place), the </p><p>Factory of Kingship or Majesty, and the Wellspring </p><p>of Ancestral Immortality." I looked round, and saw </p><p>platoons of buxom and shining African women, be- </p><p>comingly but unusually dressed in tight-fitting </p><p>white dresses and caps, and wearing rubber gloves. </p><p>Microscopes were much in evidence, as also various </p><p>receptacles from which steam was emerging. The </p><p>back of the room was screened off by a wooden </p><p>screen in which were a series of glass doors; and </p><p>these doors opened into partitions, each labelled </p><p>with a name in that unknown tongue, and each con- </p><p>taining a number of objects like the one I had seen </p><p>taken out of the basket by the giant before we were </p><p>captured. Pipes surrounded this chamber, and ap- </p><p>peared to be distributing heat from a fire in one </p><p>corner. </p><p> "Factory of Majesty!” I exclaimed. “Wellspring</p><p>of Immortality! What the dickens do you mean?” </p><p> “If you prefer a more prosaic name,” said Has-</p><p>combe, “I should call this the Institute of Religious </p><p>Tissue Culture.” My mind went back to a day in </p><p>1918 when I had been taken by a biological friend in </p><p>New York to see the famous Rockefeller Institute; </p><p>and at the word tissue culture I saw again before </p><p>me Dr. Alexis Carrell and troops of white-garbed </p><p>American girls making cultures, sterilizing, micro- </p><p>scopizing, incubating and the rest of it. The Has- </p><p>combe Institute was, it is true, not so well equipped, </p><p>but it had an even larger, if differently colored, per- </p><p>sonnel. </p><p> Hascombe began his explanations. “As you prob-</p><p>ably know, Frazer's ‘Golden Bough’* introduced us </p><p>to the idea of a sacred priest-king, and showed how </p><p>fundamental it was in primitive societies. The wel- </p><p>fare of the tribe is regarded as inextricably bound </p><p>up with that of the King, and extraordinary pre- </p><p>cautions are taken to preserve him from harm. In </p><p>this kingdom, in the old days, the King was hardly </p><p>allowed to set his foot to the ground in case he </p><p>should lose divinity; his cut hair and nail-parings </p><p>were entrusted to one of the most important officials </p><p>of state, whose duty it was to bury them secretly, in </p><p>case some enemy should compass the King’s illness </p><p>or death by using them in black magic rites. If </p><p>anyone of base blood trod on the King’s shadow, he</p><p>paid the penalty with his life. Each year a slave </p><p>was made mock-king for a week, allowed to enjoy </p><p>all the king’s privileges, and was decapitated at the </p><p>close of his brief glory; and by this means it was </p><p>supposed that the illnesses and misfortunes that </p><p>might befall the King were vicariously got rid of. </p><p> “I first of all rigged up my apparatus, and with</p><p>the aid of Aggers, succeeded in getting good cul- </p><p>tures, first of chick tissues and later, by the aid of </p><p>embryo-extract, of various adult mammalian tissues. </p><p>I then went to Bugala, and told him that I could </p><p>increase the safety, if not of the King as an indi- </p><p>vidual, at least of the life which was in him, and </p><p>that I presumed that this would be equally satisfac- </p><p>tory from a theological point of view. I pointed </p><p>out that if he chose to be made guardian of the </p><p>King’s subsidiary lives, he would be in a much more </p><p>important position than the chamberlain or the </p><p>burier of the sacred nail-parings, and might make </p><p>the post the most influential in the realm. </p><p> “Eventually I was allowed (under threats of death</p><p>if anything untoward occurred) to remove small </p><p>portions of His Majesty’s subcutaneous connective </p><p>tissue under a local anaesthetic. In the presence of </p><p>the assembled nobility I put fragments of this into </p><p> *A very elaborate treatise on a division of Roman mythol-</p><p> ogy, especially on the cult of Diana.</p><p>THE TISSUE-CULTURE KING </p><p>455 </p><p>culture medium, and showed it them under the mi- </p><p>croscope. The cultures were then put away in the </p><p>incubator, under a guard—relieved every eight </p><p>hours—of half a dozen warriors. After three days, </p><p>to my joy they had all taken and showed abundant </p><p>growth. I could see that the Council was impressed, </p><p>and reeled off a magnificent speech, pointing out </p><p>that this growth constituted an actual increase in </p><p>the quantity of the divine principle inherent in roy- </p><p>alty; and, what was more, that I could increase it </p><p>indefinitely. With that I cut each of my cultures </p><p>into eight, and sub-cultured all the pieces. They </p><p>were again put under guard, and again examined </p><p>after three days. Not all of them had taken this </p><p>time, and there were some murmurings and angry </p><p>looks, on the ground that I had killed some of the </p><p>King; but I pointed out that the King was still the </p><p>King, that his little wound had completely healed, </p><p>and that any successful cultures represented so </p><p>much extra sacredness and protection to the state. </p><p>1 must say that they were very reasonable, and had </p><p>good theological acumen, for they at once took the </p><p>hint. </p><p> "I pointed out to Bugala, and he persuaded the</p><p>rest without much difficulty, that they could now </p><p>disregard some of the older implications of the doc- </p><p>trines of kingship. The most important new idea </p><p>which I was able to introduce was mass-production. </p><p>Our aim was to multiply the King’s tissues indefi- </p><p>nitely, to ensure that some of their protecting </p><p>power should reside everywhere in the country. </p><p>Thus by concentrating upon quantity, we could </p><p>afford to remove some of the restrictions upon the </p><p>King’s mode of life. This was of course agreeable </p><p>to the King; and also to Bugala, who saw himself </p><p>wielding undreamt-of power. One might have sup- </p><p>posed that such an innovation would have met with </p><p>great resistance simply on account of its being an </p><p>innovation; but I must admit that these people com- </p><p>pared very favorably with the average business </p><p>man in their lack of prejudice. </p><p> “Having thus settled the principle, I had many</p><p>debates with Bugala as to the best methods for en- </p><p>listing the mass of the population in our scheme. </p><p>What an opportunity for scientific advertising! </p><p>But. unfortunately, the population could not read. </p><p>However, war propaganda worked very well in more </p><p>or less illiterate countries—why not here?” </p><p>HASCOMBE organized a series of public lectures </p><p>in the capital, at which he demonstrated his </p><p>regal tissues to the multitude, who were bidden to </p><p>the place by royal heralds. An impressive platform</p><p>group was always supplied from the ranks of the </p><p>nobles. The lecturer explained how important it </p><p>was for the community to become possessed of </p><p>greater and greater stores of the sacred tissues. </p><p>Unfortunately, the preparation was laborious and </p><p>expensive, and it behopved them all to lend a hand. </p><p>It had accordingly been arranged that to everyone </p><p>subscribing a cow or buffalo, or its equivalent— </p><p>three goats, pigs, or sheep—a portion of the royal </p><p>anatomy should be given, handsomely mounted in </p><p>an ebony holder. Sub-culturing would be done at </p><p>certain hours and days, and it would be obligatory </p><p>to send the cultures for renewal. If through any </p><p>negligence the tissue died, no renewal would be </p><p>made. The subscription entitled the receiver to </p><p>sub-culturing rights for a year, but was of course </p><p>renewable. By this means not only would the to- </p><p>tality of the King be much increased, to the benefit </p><p>of all, but each cultureholder would possess an ac- </p><p>tual part of His Majesty, and would have the infi </p><p>nite joy and privilege of aiding by his own efforts </p><p>the multiplication of divinity. </p><p> Then they could also serve their country by dedi-</p><p>cating a daughter to the state. These young women </p><p>would be housed and fed by the state, and taught </p><p>the technique of the sacred culture. Candidates </p><p>would be selected according to general fitness, but </p><p>would of course, in addition, be required to attain </p><p>distinction in an examination on the principles of </p><p>religion. They would be appointed for a proba </p><p>tionary period of six months. After this they would </p><p>receive a permanent status, with the title of Sisters </p><p>of the Sacred Tissue. From this, with age, expe- </p><p>rience, and merit, they could expect promotion to </p><p>the rank of mothers, grandmothers, great grand- </p><p>mothers, and grand ancestresses of the same. The </p><p>merit and benefit they would receive from their </p><p>close contact with the source of all benefits would </p><p>overflow on to their families. </p><p> The scheme worked like wildfire. Pigs, goats,</p><p>cattle, buffaloes, and negro maidens poured in. Next </p><p>year the scheme was extended to the whole country, </p><p>a peripatetic laboratory making the rounds weekly. </p><p> By the close of the third year there was hardly a</p><p>family in the country which did not possess at least </p><p>one sacred culture. To be without one would have </p><p>been like being without one’s trousers—or at least </p><p>without one’s hat*—on Fifth Avenue. Thus did </p><p>Bugala effect a reformation in the national religion, </p><p>enthrone himself as the most important personage </p><p>in the country, and entrench applied science and </p><p>Hascombe firmly in the organization of the state. </p><p> Encouraged by his success, Hascombe soon set</p><p>out to capture the ancestry-worship branch of the </p><p>religion as well. A public proclamation was made </p><p>pointing out how much more satisfactory it would </p><p>be if worship could be made not merely to the </p><p>charred bones of one’s forbears, but to bits of them </p><p>still actually living and growing. All who were </p><p>desirous of profiting by the enterprise of Bugala’s </p><p>Department of State should therefore bring their </p><p>older relatives to the laboratory at certain specified </p><p>hours, and fragments would be painlessly extracted </p><p>for culture. </p><p> This, too, proved very attractive to the average</p><p>citizen. Occasionally, it is true, grandfathers or </p><p>aged mothers arrived in a state of indignation and </p><p>protest. However, this did not matter, since, ac- </p><p>cording to the law, once children were twenty-five </p><p>years of age, they were not only assigned the duty </p><p>of worshipping their ancestors, alive or dead, but </p><p>were also given complete control over them, in order </p><p>that all rites might be duly performed to the greater </p><p>safety of the commonweal. Further, the ancestors </p><p>soon found that the operation itself was trifling, </p><p>and, what was more, that once accomplished, it had </p><p>the most desirable results. For their descendants </p><p>preferred to concentrate at once upon the culture </p><p> •This was written before the year 1927.</p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>which they would continue to worship after the old </p><p>folks were gone, and so left their parents and grand- </p><p>parents much freer than before from the irksome </p><p>restrictions which in all ages have beset the offi- </p><p>cially holy. </p><p> Thus, by almost every hearth in the kingdom, in-</p><p>stead of the old-fashioned rows of red jars contain- </p><p>ing the incinerated remains of one or other of the </p><p>family forbears, the new generation saw growing </p><p>up a collection of family slides. Each would be </p><p>taken out and reverently examined at the hour of </p><p>prayer. “Grandpapa is not growing well this week,” </p><p>you would perhaps hear the young black devotee </p><p>say; the father of the family would pray over the </p><p>speck of tissue; and if that failed, it would be taken </p><p>back to the factory for rejuvenation. On the other </p><p>hand, what rejoicing when a rhythm of activity </p><p>stirred in the cultures! A spurt on the part of </p><p>great-grandmother’s tissues would bring her wrin- </p><p>kled old smile to mind again; and sometimes it </p><p>seemed as if one particular generation were all </p><p>stirred simultaneously by a pulse of growth, as if </p><p>combining to bless their devout descendants. </p><p> To deal with the possibility of cultures dying out,</p><p>Hascombe started a central storehouse, where dupli- </p><p>cates of every strain were kept, and it was this re- </p><p>pository of the national tissues which had attracted </p><p>my attention at the back of the laboratory. No such </p><p>collection had ever existed before, he assured me. </p><p>Not a necropolis, but a histopolls, if I may coin a </p><p>word: not a cemetery, but a place of eternal growth. </p><p>THE second building was devoted to endocrine </p><p>products—an African Armour’s—and was call- </p><p>ed by the people the “Factory of Ministers to the </p><p>Shrines.” </p><p> “Here,” he said, “you will not find much new.</p><p>You know the craze for ‘glands’ that was going on </p><p>at home years ago, and its results, in the shape of </p><p>pluriglandular preparations, a new genre of patent </p><p>medicines, and a popular literature that threatened </p><p>to outdo the Freudians, and explain human beings </p><p>entirely on the basis of glandular make-up, without </p><p>reference to the mind at all. </p><p> “I had only to apply my knowledge in a compara-</p><p>tively simple manner. The first thing was to show </p><p>Bugala how. by repeated injections of pre-pituitar.v, </p><p>I could make an ordinary baby grow up into a giant. </p><p>This pleased him, and he introduced the idea of a </p><p>sacred bodyguard, all of really gigantic stature, </p><p>quite overshadowing Frederick’s Grenadiers. </p><p> “I did, however, extend knowledge in several di-</p><p>rections. I took advantage of the fact that their </p><p>religion holds in reverence monstrous and imbecile </p><p>forms of human beings. That is, of course, a com- </p><p>mon phenomenon in many countries, where half- </p><p>wits are supposed to be inspired, and dwarfs the </p><p>object of superstitious awe. So I went to work to </p><p>create various new types. By employing a particu- </p><p>lar extract of adrenal cortex, I produced children </p><p>who would have been a match for the Infant Hercu- </p><p>les, and, indeed, looked rather like a cross between </p><p>him and a brewer’s drayman. By injecting the same </p><p>extract into adolescent girls I was able to provide </p><p>them with the most copious mustaches, after which </p><p>they found ready employment as prophetesses. </p><p> "Tampering with the post-pituitary gave remark-</p><p>able cases of obesity. This, together with the pas- </p><p>sion of the men for fatness in their women, Bugala </p><p>took advantage of, and I believe made quite a for- </p><p>tune by selling as concubines female slaves treated </p><p>in this way. Finally, by another pituitary treat- </p><p>ment, I at last mastered the secret of true dwarfism, </p><p>in which perfect proportions are retained. </p><p> “Of these productions, the dwarfs are retained as</p><p>acolytes in the temple; a band of the obese young </p><p>ladies form a sort of Society of Vestal Virgins, with </p><p>special religious duties, which, as the embodiment </p><p>of the national ideal of beauty, they are supposed </p><p>to discharge with peculiarly propitious effect; and </p><p>the giants form our Regular Army. </p><p> “The Obese Virgins have set me a problem which</p><p>I confess I have not yet solved. Like all races who </p><p>set great store by sexual enjoyment, these people </p><p>have a correspondingly exaggerated reverence for </p><p>virginity. It therefore occurred to me that if I </p><p>could apply Jacques Loeb’s great discovery of arti- </p><p>ficial parthenogenesis to man, or, to be precise, to </p><p>these young ladies, I should be able to grow a race </p><p>of vestals, self-reproducing yet ever virgin, to whom </p><p>in concentrated form should attach that reverence </p><p>of which I have just spoken. You see, 1 must al- </p><p>ways remember that it is no good proposing any </p><p>line of work that will not benefit the national relig- </p><p>ion. I suppose state-aided research would have </p><p>much the same kinds of difficulties in a really demo- </p><p>cratic state. Well this, as I say, has so far beaten </p><p>me. I have taken the matter a step further than </p><p>Bataillon with his fatherless frogs, and have in- </p><p>duced parthenogenesis in the eggs of reptiles and </p><p>birds; but so far I have failed with mammals. How- </p><p>ever, I’ve not given up yet!” </p><p> Then we passed to the next laboratory, which was</p><p>full of the most incredible animal monstrosities. </p><p>"This laboratory is the most amusing,” said Has- </p><p>combe. “Its official title is ‘Home of the Living</p><p>Fetishes.’ Here again I have simply taken a preva- </p><p>lent trait of the populace, and used it as a peg on </p><p>which to hang research. I told you that they al- </p><p>ways had a fancy for the grotesque in animals, and </p><p>used the most bizarre forms, in the shape of little </p><p>clay or ivory statuettes, for fetishes. </p><p> “I thought I would see whether art could not im-</p><p>prove upon nature, and set myself to recall my ex- </p><p>perimental embryology. I use only the simplest </p><p>methods. I utilize the plasticity of tho earliest </p><p>stages to give double-headed and cyclopean mon- </p><p>sters. That was, of course, done years ago in newts </p><p>by Spemann and fish by Stockard; and T have </p><p>merely applied the mass-production methods of Mr. </p><p>Ford to their results. But my specialties are three- </p><p>headed snakes, and toads with an extra heaven- </p><p>pointing head. The former are a little difficult, </p><p>but there is a great demand for them, and they </p><p>fetch a good price. The frogs are easier: I simply </p><p>apply Harrison’s methods to embryo tadpoles.” </p><p> He then showed me into the last building. Un-</p><p>like the others, this contained no signs of research </p><p>in progress, but was empty. It was draped with </p><p>black hangings, and lit only from the top. In the </p><p>centre were rows of ebony benches, and in front of </p><p>them a glittering golden ball on a stand. </p><p>THE TISSUE-CULTURE KING </p><p>457 </p><p> “Here I am beginning my work on reinforced</p><p>telepathy,” he told me. “Some day you must come </p><p>and see what it's all about, for it really is inter- </p><p>esting.” </p><p> You may imagine that I was pretty well flabber-</p><p>gasted by this catalogue of miracles. Every day I </p><p>got a talk with Hascombe, and gradually the talks </p><p>became recognized events of our daily routine. One </p><p>day I asked if he had given up hope of escaping. </p><p>He showed a queer hesitation in replying. Eventu- </p><p>ally he said, "To tell you the truth, my dear Jones, </p><p>I have really hardly thought of it these last few </p><p>years. It seemed so impossible at first that I delib- </p><p>erately put it out of my head and turned with more </p><p>and more energy, I might almost say fury, to my </p><p>work. And now, upon my soul, I am not quite sure </p><p>whether I want to escape or not.” </p><p> "Not want to!" I exclaimed; "surely you can’t</p><p>mean that!” </p><p> “I am not so sure,” he rejoined. "What I most</p><p>want is to get ahead with this work of mine. Why, </p><p>man, you don’t realize what a chance I’ve got! And </p><p>it is all growing so fast—I can see every kind of </p><p>possibility ahead”; and he broke off into silence. </p><p> However, although I was interested enough in his</p><p>past achievements, I did not feel willing to sacrifice </p><p>my future to his perverted intellectual ambitions. </p><p>But he would not leave his work. </p><p>THE experiments which most excited his imagi- </p><p>nation were those he was conducting into mass </p><p>telepathy. He had received his medical training </p><p>at a time when abnormal psychology was still very </p><p>unfashionable in England, but had luckily been </p><p>thrown in contact with a young doctor who was a </p><p>keen student of hypnotism, through whom he had </p><p>been introduced to some of the great pioneers, like </p><p>Bramwell and Wingfield. As a result, he had be- </p><p>come a passable hypnotist himself, with a fair </p><p>knowledge of the literature. </p><p> In the early days of his captivity he became inter-</p><p>ested in the sacred dances which took place every </p><p>night of full moon, and were regarded as propitia- </p><p>tions of the celestial powers. The dancers all be- </p><p>long to a special sect. After a series of exciting </p><p>figures, symbolizing various activities of the chase, </p><p>war, and love, the leader conducts his band to a </p><p>ceremonial bench. He then begins to make passes </p><p>at them; and what impressed Hascombe was this,</p><p>that a few seconds sufficed for them to fall back in </p><p>deep hypnosis against the ebony rail. It recalled, </p><p>he said, the most startling cases of collective hyp- </p><p>nosis recorded by the French scientists. The leader </p><p>next passed from one end of the bench to the other, </p><p>whispering a brief sentence into each ear. He then, </p><p>according to immemorial rite, approached the </p><p>Priest-King, and, after having exclaimed aloud </p><p>“Lord of Majesty, command what thou wilt for thy </p><p>dancers to perform,” the King would thereupon </p><p>command some action which had previously been </p><p>kept secret. The command was often to fetch some </p><p>object and deposit at the moon-shrine; or to fight </p><p>the enemies of the state; or (and this was what the </p><p>company most liked) to be some animal, or bird. </p><p>Whatever the command, the hypnotized men would </p><p>obey it, for the leader’s whispered words had been </p><p>an order to hear and carry out only what the King </p><p>said; and the strangest scenes would be witnessed </p><p>as they ran, completely oblivious of all in their </p><p>path, in search of the gourds or sheep they had been </p><p>called on to procure, or lunged in a symbolic way at </p><p>invisible enemies, or threw themselves on all fours </p><p>and roared as lions, or galloped as zebras, or danced </p><p>as cranes. The command executed, they stood like </p><p>stocks or stones, until their leader, running from </p><p>one to the other, touched each with a finger and </p><p>shouted “Wake.” They woke, and limp, but con- </p><p>scious of having been the vessels of the unknown </p><p>spirit, danced back to their special hut or club- </p><p>house. </p><p> This susceptibility to hypnotic suggestion struck</p><p>Hascombe, and he obtained permission to test the </p><p>performers more closely. He soon established that </p><p>the people were, as a race, extremely prone to dis- </p><p>sociation, and could be made to lapse into deep hyp- </p><p>nosis with great ease, but a hypnosis in which the </p><p>subconscious, though completely cut off from the </p><p>waking self, comprised portions of the personality </p><p>not retained in the hypnotic selves of Europeans. </p><p>Like most who have fluttered round the psychologi- </p><p>cal candle, he had been interested in the notion of </p><p>telepathy; and now, with this supply of hypnotic </p><p>subjects under his hands, began some real investi- </p><p>gation of the problem. </p><p> By picking his subjects, he was soon able to dem-</p><p>onstrate the existence of telepathy, by making sug- </p><p>gestions to one hypnotized man who transferred </p><p>them without physical intermediation to another at </p><p>a distance. Later—and this was the culmination of </p><p>his work—he found that when he made a suggestion </p><p>to several subjects at once, the telepathic effect was </p><p>much stronger than if he had done it to one at a </p><p>time—the hypnotized minds were reinforcing each </p><p>other. “I’m after the super-consciousness,” Has-</p><p>combe said, “and I’ve already got the rudiments </p><p>of it.” </p><p> I must confess that I got almost as excited as</p><p>Hascombe over the possibilities thus opened up. It </p><p>certainly seemed as if he were right in principle. </p><p>If all the subjects were in practically the same </p><p>psychological state, extraordinary reinforcing ef- </p><p>fects were observed. At first the attainment of </p><p>this similarity of condition was very difficult; grad- </p><p>ually, however, we discovered that it was possible </p><p>to tune hypnotic subjects to the same pitch, if I </p><p>may use the metaphor, and then the fun really </p><p>began. </p><p> First of all we found that with increasing rein-</p><p>forcement, we could get telepathy conducted to </p><p>greater and greater distances, until finally we could </p><p>transmit commands from the capital to the national </p><p>boundary, nearly a hundred miles. We next found </p><p>that it was not necessary for the subject to be in </p><p>hypnosis to receive the telepathic command. Almost </p><p>everybody, but especially those of equable tempera- </p><p>ment, could thus be influenced. Most extraordinary </p><p>of all, however, were what we at first christened </p><p>"near effects,” since their transmission to a distance </p><p>was not found possible until later. If, after Has- </p><p>combe had suggested some simple command to a </p><p>largish group of hypnotized subjects, he or I went </p><p>right up among them, we would experience the most </p><p>extraordinary sensation, as of some superhuman </p><p>personality repeating the command in a menacing </p><p>458 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>and overwhelming way and, whereas with one part </p><p>of ourselves we felt that we must carry out the </p><p>command, with another we felt, if I may say so, as </p><p>if we were only a part of the command, or of some- </p><p>thing much bigger than ourselves which was com- </p><p>manding. And this, Hascombe claimed, was the </p><p>first real beginning of the super-consciousness. </p><p> Bugala, of course, had to be considered. Has-</p><p>combe, with the old Tibetan prayer-wheel at the </p><p>back of his mind, suggested that eventually he </p><p>would be able to induce hypnosis in the whole pop- </p><p>ulation, and then transmit a prayer. This would </p><p>ensure that the daily prayer, for instance, was </p><p>really said by the whole population, and, what is </p><p>more, simultaneously, which would undoubtedly </p><p>much enhance its efficacy. And it would make it pos- </p><p>sible in times of calamity or battle to keep the </p><p>whole praying force of the nation at work for long </p><p>spells together. </p><p>BUGALA was deeply interested. He saw himself, </p><p>through this mental machinery, planting such </p><p>ideas as he wished in the brain-cases of his people. </p><p>He saw himself willing an order; and the whole </p><p>population rousing itself out of trance to execute it. </p><p>He dreamt dreams before which those of the pro- </p><p>prietor of a newspaper syndicate, even those of a </p><p>director of propaganda in wartime, would be pale </p><p>and timid. Naturally, he wished to receive per- </p><p>sonal instruction in the methods himself; and, </p><p>equally naturally, we could not refuse him, though </p><p>I must say that I often felt a little uneasy as to </p><p>what he might choose to do if he ever decided to </p><p>override Hascombe and to start experimenting on </p><p>his own. This, combined with my constant long- </p><p>ing to get away from the place, led me to cast about </p><p>again for means of escape. Then it occurred to me </p><p>that this very method about which I had such </p><p>gloomy presentiments, might itself be made the </p><p>key to our prison. </p><p> So one day, after getting Hascombe worked up</p><p>about the loss to humanity it would be to let this </p><p>great discovery die with him in Africa, I set to in </p><p>earnest. "My dear Hascombe,” I said, “ you must </p><p>get home out of this. What is there to prevent you </p><p>saying to Bugala that your experiments are nearly </p><p>crowned with success, but that for certain tests you </p><p>must have a much greater number of subjects at </p><p>your disposal? You can then get a battery of two </p><p>hundred men, and after you have tuned them, the </p><p>reinforcement will be so great that you will have </p><p>at your disposal a mental force big enough to affect </p><p>the whole population. Then, of course, one fine day</p><p>we should raise the potential of our mind-batterv to </p><p>the highest possible level, and send out through it </p><p>a general hypnotic influence. The whole country, </p><p>men, women, and children, would sink into stupor. </p><p>Next we should give our experimental squad the </p><p>suggestion to broadcast ‘sleep for a week.’ The tele- </p><p>pathic message would be relayed to each of the thou- </p><p>sands of minds waiting receptively for it, and would </p><p>take root in them, until the whole nation became a </p><p>single super-consciousness, conscious only of the </p><p>one thought ‘sleep’ which we had thrown into it.” </p><p> The reader will perhaps ask how we ourselves</p><p>expected to escape from the clutches of the super- </p><p>consciousness we had created. Well, we had dis- </p><p>covered that metal was relatively impervious to the </p><p>telepathic effect, and had prepared for ourselves a </p><p>sort of tin pulpit, behind which we could stand while </p><p>conducting experiments. This, combined with caps </p><p>of metal foil, enormously reduced the effects on our- </p><p>selves. We had not informed Bugala of this prop- </p><p>erty of metal. </p><p> Hascombe was silent. At length he spoke. "I</p><p>like the idea, he said; “I like to think that if I ever </p><p>do get back to England and to scientific recognition, </p><p>my discovery will have given me the means of </p><p>escape.” </p><p> From that moment we worked assiduously to per-</p><p>fect our method and our plans. After about five </p><p>months everything seemed propitious. We had pro- </p><p>visions packed away, and compasses. I had been al- </p><p>lowed to keep my rifle, on promise that I would </p><p>never discharge it. We had made friends with some </p><p>of the men who went trading to the coast, and had </p><p>got from them all the information we could about </p><p>the route, without arousing their suspicions. </p><p> At last, the night arrived. We assembled our</p><p>men as if for an ordinary practice, and after hyp- </p><p>nosis had been induced, started to tune them. At </p><p>this moment Bugala came in, unannounced. This </p><p>was what we had been afraid of; but there had been </p><p>no means of preventing it. “What shall we do?” I </p><p>whispered to Hascombe, in English. “Go right </p><p>ahead and be damned to it,” was his answer; “we </p><p>can put him to sleep with the rest.” </p><p> So we welcomed him, and gave him a seat as near</p><p>as possible to the tightly-packed ranks of the per- </p><p>'formers. At length the preparations were finished. </p><p>Hascombe went into the pulpit and said, “Attention </p><p>to the words which are to be suggested.” There </p><p>was a slight stiffening of the bodies. “Sleep!” said </p><p>Hascombe. "Sleep is the command: command all </p><p>in this land to sleep unbrokenly.” Bugala leapt up</p><p>with an exclamation; but the induction had already </p><p>begun. </p><p> We with our metal coverings were immune. But</p><p>Bugala was struck by the full force of the mental </p><p>current. He sank back on his chair, helpless. For </p><p>a few minutes his extraordinary will resisted the </p><p>suggestion. Although he could not move, his angry </p><p>eyes were open. But at length he succumbed, and </p><p>he too slept. </p><p> We lost no time in starting, and made good prog-</p><p>ress through the silent country. The people were </p><p>sitting about like wax figures. Women sat asleep </p><p>by their milk-pails, the cow by this time far away. </p><p>Fat-bellied naked children slept at their games. The </p><p>houses were full of sleepers sleeping upright round </p><p>their food, recalling Wordsworth’s famous “party </p><p>in a parlor.” </p><p> So we went on, feeling pretty queer and scarcely</p><p>believing in this morphic state into which we had </p><p>plunged a nation. Finally the frontier was reached, </p><p>where with extreme elation, we passed an immobile </p><p>and gigantic frontier guard. A few miles further </p><p>we had a good solid meal, and a doze. Our kit was </p><p>rather heavy, and we decided to jettison some super- </p><p>fluous weight, in the shape of some food, specimens, </p><p>and our metal headgear, or mind-protectors, which </p><p>at this distance, and with the hypnosis wearing a </p><p>little thin, were, we thought, no longer necessary. </p><p>THE TISSUE-CULTURE KING </p><p>459 </p><p> About nightfall on the third day, Hascombe sud-</p><p> denly stopped and turned his head.</p><p> ‘‘What’s the matter?” I said, “Have you seen a</p><p> lion?” His reply was completely unexpected. “No.</p><p> I was just wondering whether really I ought not to</p><p> go back again.”</p><p> “Go back again,” I cried. “What in the name of</p><p> God Almighty do you want to do that for?”</p><p> "It suddenly struck me that I ought to,” he said,</p><p> “about five minutes ago. And really, when one</p><p> comes to think of it, I don’t suppose I shall ever</p><p> get such a chance at research again. What’s more,</p><p> this is a dangerous journey to the coast, and I don’t</p><p> expect we shall get through alive.”</p><p> I was thoroughly upset and put out, and told him</p><p>so. And suddenly, for a few moments, I felt I must </p><p>) go back too. It was like that old friend of our boy- </p><p>hood, the voice of conscience. </p><p> “Yes, to be sure, we ought to go back,” I thought</p><p> with fervor. But suddenly checking myself as the</p><p> thought came under the play of reason—“Why</p><p> should we go back?” All sorts of reasons were</p><p> proffered, as it were by unseen hands reaching up</p><p> out of the hidden parts of me.</p><p>immovable. He must go back; he knew it; he saw </p><p>it clearly; it was his sacred duty; and much other </p><p>similar rubbish. All this time the suggestion was </p><p>attacking me too; and finally I felt that if I did not </p><p>put more distance between me and that unisonic </p><p>battery of will, I should succumb as well as he. </p><p> “Hascombe,” I said, “I am going on. For God's</p><p>sake, come with me.” And I shouldered my pack, </p><p>and set off. He was shaken, I saw, and came a few </p><p>steps after me. But finally he turned, and, in spite </p><p>of my frequent pauses and shouts to him to follow </p><p>made off in the direction we had come. I can assure </p><p>you that it was with a gloomy soul that I continued </p><p>my solitary way. I shall not bore you with my ad- </p><p>ventures. Suffice it to say that at last I got to a </p><p>white outpost, weak with fatigue and poor food and </p><p>fever. </p><p> I kept very quiet about my adventures, only giv-</p><p>ing out that our expedition had lost its way and </p><p>that my men had run away or been killed by the </p><p>local tribes. At last I reached England. But I was </p><p>a broken man, and a profound gloom had invaded </p><p>my mind at the thought of Hascombe and the way</p><p>he had been caught in his own net. I never found </p><p>out what happened to him, and I do not suppose that </p><p>I am likely to find out now. You may ask why 1 </p><p>did not try to organize a rescue expedition; or why, </p><p>at least, I did not bring Hascombe’s discoveries be- </p><p>fore the Royal Society or the Metaphysical Insti- </p><p>tute. I can only repeat that I was a broken man. </p><p>I did not expect to be believed; I was not at all sure </p><p>that I could repeat our results, even on the same </p><p>human material, much less with men of another </p><p>race; I dreaded ridicule; and finally I was tormented </p><p>by doubts as to whether the knowledge of mass-tel- </p><p>epathy would not be a curse rather than a blessing </p><p>to mankind. </p><p> However, I am an oldish man now and, what is</p><p>more, old for my years. I want to get the story off </p><p>my chest. Besides, old men like sermonizing and </p><p>you must forgive, gentle reader, the sermonical turn </p><p>which I now feel I must take. The question 1 want </p><p>to raise is this: Dr. Hascombe attained to an unsur- </p><p>passed power in a number of the applications of </p><p>science—but to what end did all this power serve? </p><p>It is the merest cant and twaddle to go on asserting, </p><p>as most of our press and people continue to do, that </p><p>increase of scientific knowledge and power must in </p><p>itself be good. I commend to the great public the </p><p>obvious moral of my story and ask them to think </p><p>what they propose to do with the power which is </p><p>gradually being accumulated for them by the labors </p><p>of those who labor because they like power, or be- </p><p>cause they want to find the truth about how things </p><p>work. </p><p> AND then I realized what had happened. Bugala</p><p> had waked up; he had wiped out the suggestion</p><p> we had given to the super-consciousness, and in its</p><p> place put in another. I could see him thinking it</p><p> out, the cunning devil (one must give him credit</p><p> for brains!), and hear him, after making his passes,</p><p> whisper to the nation in prescribed form his new</p><p> suggestion: “Will to return!” “Return!” For most</p><p> of the inhabitants the command would have no</p><p> meaning, for they would have been already at home.</p><p> Doubtless some young men out on the hills, or</p><p> truant children, or girls run off in secret to meet</p><p> their lovers, were even now returning, stiffly and in</p><p> somnambulistic trance, to their homes. It was only</p><p> for them that the new command of the super-con-</p><p> sciousness had any meaning—and for us.</p><p> I am putting it in a long and discursive way; at</p><p> the moment I simply saw what had happened in a</p><p> flash. I told Hascombe, I showed him it must be so,</p><p> that nothing else would account for the sudden</p><p> change, I begged and implored him to use his rea-</p><p> son, to stick to his decision and to come on. How</p><p> I regretted that, in our desire to discard all useless</p><p> weight, we had left behind our metal telepathy-</p><p> proof head coverings!</p><p> But Hascombe would not, or could not, see my</p><p> point. I suppose he was much more imbued with</p><p> all the feelings and spirit of the country, and so</p><p> more susceptible. However that may be, he was</p><p>The End. </p><p>The RETREAT TO MARS </p><p>Tiuj Cecil RWhite </p><p>/Author of JiThe Lost Continent” </p><p>. . .

I stood there as the twi- </p><p>light arch swept up from the east, </p><p>watching the shadows creep over land </p><p>an3 sea while the faint evening clouds overhead </p><p>turned blood-red under the last glancing rays of </p><p>the sun. </p><p> Many times had I watched the setting of the sun</p><p>and the evening shadows, while the mosquito- </p><p>hawks hovered overhead with their plaintive cries, </p><p>or plunged whirring downward upon their prey. </p><p>Never twice the same that picture held me, until </p><p>the city lights sprang into being in the distance </p><p>and the flashing lights of the sentinels of the coast </p><p>pierced through the gloaming. </p><p> As I turned away to begin my night’s work the</p><p>crunch of footsteps on the gravel path broke the </p><p>stillness of the evening. An elderly, bearded man </p><p>approached. He had come up the trail and I had </p><p>not noticed him until he was nearly upon me. </p><p> Visitors to my little observatory are not uncom-</p><p>mon. A few, those who show interest more than </p><p>curiosity, are allowed to look through the instru- </p><p>ment, on the rare occasions when it is not engaged </p><p>in photographic or spectrographic work. </p><p> “Mr. Arnold?" queried my visitor as he ap-</p><p>proached. “I hope that I am not intruding. I </p><p>tried to get you on the 'phone today, but was un- </p><p>successful, and having been told that I would find </p><p>you here, I took the liberty of coming to see you." </p><p> “I am just about to open up for the night”</p><p>said I, “and if you don’t mind my carrying on </p><p>with my work—” </p><p> “Not at all, not at all,” he replied, “I can talk</p><p>to you just as well—that is, if I will not be in your </p><p>way?” </p><p> Having been assured that he would not trouble</p><p>me, he followed me into the observatory and </p><p>watched while I opened the shutters that covered </p><p>the aperture of the dome. </p><p> This done and my right-ascension circle set I</p><p>turned the telescope on the first star of my eve- </p><p>ning’s program. </p><p> When I had started the exposure, and entered</p><p>up the necessary data in the observing book, I </p><p>turned to him. </p><p> “You must pardon me,</p><p>my dear sir, if I ap- </p><p>pear to be rude or in- </p><p>hospitable, but I am </p><p>anxious to obtain a spec- </p><p>trogram* (1) of this star </p><p>before it gets too far </p><p>west for observing” I ex- </p><p>plained. “All I have to </p><p>do now is to keep the </p><p>star's image on the slit </p><p>of the spectroscope. </p><p> "I noticed that you</p><p>were engaged in spectrographic work,” he remarked. </p><p>“How long will your exposure be?” </p><p> From his remark I gathered that he knew some-</p><p>thing of the work in hand, so I answered, "About </p><p>*(1) Spectrogram. A photograph of the spectrum. </p><p>forty-five minutes with this seeing* (2). It’s a </p><p>fifth magnitude star that I am working on. Would </p><p>you care to take a look at it?” </p><p> He climbed up the observing ladder and stood</p><p>beside me while I explained things to him. When </p><p>I had finished he turned to me, half smilingly, and </p><p>said: </p><p> “Is this seeing anything like it was last Novem-</p><p>ber when you made your remarkable observations </p><p>of the planet Mars?” </p><p> "Apparently you have been reading my papers,"</p><p>I said. "No, conditions are not nearly as favor- </p><p>able now as they were at the time that other work </p><p>was done. If I were to live a thousand years I </p><p>doubt if I should ever see other nights to equal </p><p>those four." </p><p> “Yes, I did read those papers of yours,” he re-</p><p>plied. “They are the cause of my presence here </p><p>this evening. I am Hargraves, of the Smithsonian </p><p>Institute." </p><p> I took his proffered hand. Hargraves was a well-</p><p>known archaeologist, though I must confess that </p><p>I should not have known of him except by chance. </p><p>On glancing through “Science Abstracts” a few </p><p>weeks previously, I happened on an abstract of a </p><p>paper of his which aroused my curiosity, and I </p><p>had looked up the original, which had proved highly </p><p>interesting.</p><p> I admitted as much to him. He laughed. “We</p><p>work in different spheres, as a rule" he said, “but </p><p>this time I am stepping into yours. That was a </p><p>great fight you had with Krussen and his associates </p><p>over Schiaparelli’s “canali” </p><p> "Wasn’t it,” said I. "The trouble with those</p><p>chaps is that they do not know what good seeing is </p><p>really like. They have, perhaps forty or fifty clear </p><p>nights a year, none of which begin to compare </p><p>with our good nights. Then, because they have a </p><p>fifty-four inch refractor* (3) against my twenty- </p><p>four inch, they think that they are much better </p><p>able to see fine detail than I am. Let me tell you, </p><p>Doctor Hargraves, those four nights were perfect, </p><p>absolutely perfect. I was able to use my highest </p><p>power* (4) of four thousand and there was not </p><p>the slightest tremor in the image. Had my driving- </p><p>clock been perfect, I could </p><p>have photographed every- </p><p>thing I saw.” </p><p> “I know,” my compan-</p><p>ion replied. “Every detail </p><p>of your drawings was cor- </p><p>rect. You may wonder </p><p>how I—an archaologist— </p><p>know anything about the </p><p>planet Mars, but I have a </p><p>big surprise in store for </p><p>you.” </p><p> I looked at him in</p><p>amazement. </p><p> *(2) Seeing.

As you are probably aware, I </p><p>have only recently returned from Africa after a </p><p>six years’ absence.” </p><p> 1 nodded, for in the paper I have already men-</p><p>tioned, Hargraves announced that he had made </p><p>some startling discoveries in Africa as to the </p><p>origin of mankind, . . . discoveries which </p><p>overthrew previous theories about the origin of </p><p>man, but the exact nature of his find was not to </p><p>be made public until such time, when the records </p><p>he had found hidden away in a remote corner of </p><p>“Darkest Africa” were fully deciphered. </p><p> “Some years ago,” he continued, “I became con-</p><p>vinced that the rise of mankind took place, not </p><p>in Asia where it is generally supposed to have oc- </p><p>curred, but in Africa. </p><p> “This belief thrust itself upon me as I was writ-</p><p>ing a book which I never published; a book which </p><p>was to have traced the migration of mankind from </p><p>the place of its origin, over this globe of ours. I </p><p>amassed a tremendous amount of data which led, </p><p>when I came to piece it together, to Central Africa, </p><p>and not to Asia as I had confidently expected. </p><p> “I searched again and again for an error which</p><p>I thought must exist in my work, but the trail </p><p>inevitably led to the same conclusion: Central </p><p>Africa was the ‘Garden of Eden’ of mankind. </p><p> “As you are aware, this was contrary to all</p><p>earlier evidence, so I did not care to propound my </p><p>theories without further corroboration. On con- </p><p>sulting with the heads of my department, laying </p><p>the evidence before them, it was decided to or- </p><p>ganize an expedition to see if any fresh data was </p><p>available on the ground itself. </p><p> "The expedition, a small one as such things go,</p><p>was organized and led by myself. It was success- </p><p>ful, but the results are not yet ready for publica- </p><p>tion. To you, however, I would like to show what </p><p>we have found, the understanding being, of course, </p><p>that it shall not be divulged until my work is </p><p>finished. Could you come and see me at my hotel? </p><p>I will probably be in town for a week, anyway.” </p><p> “Why not come and spend tomorrow evening with</p><p>me?” I asked. </p><p> So we arranged it.</p><p> Having finished the spectrogram, I showed my</p><p>companion what I could of my equipment and </p><p>turned the telescope upon a few of the show objects </p><p>in the heavens, which delighted him immensely. </p><p>After this I saw him safely started down the trail, </p><p>equipped with a flashlight to light his way to the </p><p>road, where his taxi awaited him. </p><p> Throughout the night I could not keep from won-</p><p>dering what Hargraves had found in Africa that </p><p>could be connected with the planet Mars. The </p><p>dawn found me without a conjecture and I turned </p><p>in to dream wild dreams of Hargraves and Africa. </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>THE following evening found us comfortably </p><p>settled in my den. I was eager to hear his </p><p>story. </p><p> “I am not going to prolong my story with the</p><p>details of the hardships of our journey” Hargraves </p><p>began. “It is the usual stuff one reads in books </p><p>of travel. Famine, thirst and fever played their </p><p>usual roles, with the result that my two white </p><p>companions were out of the game before two years </p><p>had passed. One died, and the other had to be </p><p>escorted back to the coast, where he subsequently </p><p>recovered. </p><p> “With a handful of native bearers, I pressed</p><p>on with the search, following every clue and rumor, </p><p>only to be disappointed time and time again. We </p><p>moved slowly and laboriously through unexplored </p><p>Central Africa, ever seeking traces of man’s handi- </p><p>work other than that of the natives. </p><p> “I was laid up in camp with an attack of fever</p><p>when another rumor was brought by a native who </p><p>had heard of our quest. This time it was sub- </p><p>stantiated by evidence in the form of a curiously </p><p>shaped piece of metal. This was, in form, some- </p><p>what like a shoehorn and pointed in two places </p><p>with an ingenious form of ball-and-socket joint. On </p><p>examining it closely I saw that there had been two </p><p>other pieces attached to the central portion, which </p><p>had evidently been snapped off. Where the metal </p><p>showed its broken surface it was bright and </p><p>crystalline in appearance, so that I judged the </p><p>break was of recent date. At first I thought that </p><p>the natives who had found it had cleaned it up, </p><p>for the surface was bright and shiny. </p><p> “Lying there in my blankets, I questioned the</p><p>messenger through my interpreter, but I was as- </p><p>sured that it was just as it had been found some</p><p>years before. The metal of which it was made </p><p>was unknown to me. It looked like steel, with a </p><p>lustrous surface, but it weighed no more than an </p><p>equal amount of aluminum. Later tests showed </p><p>that it had much greater strength than steel and </p><p>that it was extremely hard; even a file would leave </p><p>no mark upon it. </p><p> “From what I could gather it had been picked</p><p>up in a valley lying some ten or eleven days’ journey </p><p>to the northwest of us, when several members of </p><p>his tribe had ventured in on a hunting expedition. </p><p> “I say ‘ventured in’ because the whole of the</p><p>area in question is looked upon by the local tribes </p><p>as the abode of the dead, and it was only when </p><p>starvation threatened, and hunger overcame their </p><p>fears, that they dared to penetrate this forbidden </p><p>valley. </p><p> “Impatiently I waited until I was well enough</p><p>to travel, then we set out with the messenger as </p><p>a guide. Gradually the character of the country </p><p>changed until the swampy, fever infested jungle </p><p>gave way to a rolling park-like country. </p><p> “Our way led steadily upwards until on the ninth</p><p>day we were moving over a verdant plateau which </p><p>was alive with small game. My little pocket aneroid </p><p>barometer showed us that we were about four- </p><p>thousand five hundred feet above sea level. That </p><p>evening we camped at the foot of a low range of </p><p>hills and our guide assured me that on the morrow </p><p>we should enter the forbidden valley. </p><p> “True to his promise, the following noon found</p><p>us at the entrance to a little valley bounded by low </p><p>hills, through which flowed a considerable stream. </p><p>The hills on either side were gloriously green, be- </p><p>tokening a generous supply of moisture, the park- </p><p>like character of the valley being enhanced by oc- </p><p>casional groups of a species of oak tree, and here </p><p>THE RETREAT TO MARS </p><p>463 </p><p>and there patches of a flowering shrub whose scent </p><p>filled the valley with a delicious odor. The bark </p><p>of this bush, 1 learned, was used by the natives </p><p>in lieu of tobacco, and it was not half bad as a </p><p>substitute, I can assure you, especially after one </p><p>had been many months without the comfort of </p><p>‘Lady Nicotine.’ </p><p> ‘‘It was with the greatest difficulty that I per-</p><p>suaded our guide to remain with us, and then only </p><p>after I had presented him with a charm in the </p><p>shape of a ring, which I had to assure him would </p><p>ward off all danger, did he consent to enter the val- </p><p>ley with us. </p><p> “Late that afternoon, we arrived near the spot</p><p>where our guide had found this metal object. We </p><p>made camp at once and I set out to survey the </p><p>valley. </p><p> “About a quarter of a mile from the camp the</p><p>floor of the valley narrowed, bounded on the one </p><p>side by a steep cliff and the other by a ridge which </p><p>ran out at right angles from the southern slope. </p><p>This formation immediately aroused my curiosity, </p><p>for I thought that there must be some outcrop of </p><p>rock here, which kept the flood-waters of the </p><p>stream from removing it. Besides, I was anxious </p><p>to learn something of the geological formations of </p><p>this district. </p><p> “Attended by my guide, I walked down the val-</p><p>ley towards this formation. Sure enough there was </p><p>an outcrop of rock on the north side, a hard lime- </p><p>stone formation whose foot was lapped by the </p><p>waters of the stream. Wading through the shallow </p><p>water, we crossed over to the south bank. </p><p> “Where the waters had removed the surface soil</p><p>I saw what at first I took to be a rib of rock </p><p>reaching into the stream. On closer inspection </p><p>I saw that this was, not rock, but metal. It was </p><p>worn and scored by the waters of ages, but on </p><p>scraping away the soil above the flood level I ex- </p><p>posed clean cut edges. A rib of the metal ran </p><p>back into the hillside. </p><p>«'1T7'ITH a sharp stake I probed the soft, loamy </p><p> *	» soil and was able to trace the direction</p><p>of this rib up the hillside for a distance of perhaps </p><p>thirty feet, where the covering became too deep </p><p>for my probe to penetrate. Marking the spot where </p><p>I could last feel it, T skirted the east and west</p><p>sides of the mound with the hope of finding an- </p><p>other clue, but I could see nothing. </p><p> "The tropical night shut down with its usual</p><p>suddenness during my investigations, so we wended </p><p>our way back to camp, where the light of a fire </p><p>danced and flickered in the evening air. How I </p><p>wished for a battery for my flashlight. The bat- </p><p>teries, however, had perished long ago in the steam- </p><p>ing jungle air, and I had to wait until morning </p><p>with this discovery before me.” </p><p> “I know how you felt,” I interrupted. “I expe-</p><p>rienced the same feeling last night.” </p><p> Hargraves smiled and continued.</p><p> “That evening I set the boys to work to construct</p><p>rude digging implements from the scrub oak of the </p><p>hillside. Crude they were, indeed, but they would </p><p>serve my purpose in that light soil. </p><p> “Long before daylight, the camp was astir, and</p><p>by the time the sun rose the morning meal was </p><p>over and we were on our way to the mysterious </p><p>mound. Setting the boys to work at intervals </p><p>along a continuation of the line 1 had already </p><p>traced out, the metal rib was soon located higher </p><p>up the hillside, covered by some four feet of earth. </p><p> “I now saw that it might save time to have a</p><p>couple of natives working directly on top of the </p><p>mound, so transferring two of them, I directed </p><p>them to clear away the top soil, while the others </p><p>continued to trace the rib up the hillside. </p><p> “Two hours passed when a shout from the top</p><p>told me they had made some discovery. When 1 </p><p>arrived there they were clearing away the dry </p><p>soil from what appeared to be a flat metal surface. </p><p>Calling up the other boys we were soon at work </p><p>removing the earth from the rounded top of the </p><p>hillock. </p><p> “Little by little the metal surface was laid bare,</p><p>showing it to be, not flat, but rounded with the ex- </p><p>posed slope falling towards the stream. Late that </p><p>afternoon we had come to the southern edge of the </p><p>spherical surface. Here a smooth wall dropped </p><p>away at an angle of sixty-five degrees with the </p><p>vertical, as my clinometer showed. Something </p><p>else was also revealed. We laid bare another metal </p><p>rib which lay in a line with the first one. </p><p> “Again night cut short our work and tired out</p><p>from exertions with my primitive shovel, I fell </p><p>asleep directly after supper, to wake and find the</p><p>eastern sky reddening under the rays of the rising </p><p>sun. </p><p> “Working down the convex slope we gradually</p><p>laid bare the surface until one of the boys revealed </p><p>a crack in the hitherto unbroken surface. As the soil </p><p>was rapidly removed we exposed a circular plate set </p><p>flush in the metal. Near the periphery and dia- </p><p>metrically opposite each other were two holes which </p><p>we rapidly cleaned out, showing them to be let in </p><p>the plate at an angle of perhaps thirty degrees. </p><p> “With the aid of the boys I tried to lift this</p><p>cover, or whatever it might be, but it seemed to </p><p>be as solid as the rest. A close scrutiny of the </p><p>edge, which was a little ragged in one place,1 made </p><p>me think it might be threaded. With this in mind </p><p>I placed two stout sticks in the holes and attempted </p><p>to turn it, but with no success until it occurred </p><p>to me to try the opposite direction. Throwing my </p><p>weight on the lever with one of the boys doing the </p><p>same on the other side I essayed to turn the plate </p><p>once more. Suddenly we were both sprawling on </p><p>our hands and knees. The plate had turned. </p><p> ‘-‘Unmindful of my bruises, I jumped to the plate,</p><p>and gradually we unscrewed it, the plate, with each </p><p>turn, rising higher and higher from the surface </p><p>in which it was set. When it stood fully eighteen </p><p>inches high we came to the end of the screw and </p><p>by our combined efforts swung the heavy disc of </p><p>metal aside. Subsequent measures showed it to </p><p>be twenty-eight inches in diameter and twenty </p><p>thick. </p><p> “We had uncovered a hole some two feet deep,</p><p>at the bottom of which was another plate. Ar- </p><p>ranged in the form of a square of twelve on a side </p><p>were one hundred and forty-four equally spaced </p><p>circular holes, each one about half-an-inch in di- </p><p>ameter, and on the plate lay six metal objects. I </p><p>picked these up and examined them one by one. </p><p>464 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>They were similar in shape and size and were in </p><p>the form of a rod of circular cross section, six </p><p>inches long with a cross piece on top giving them </p><p>the form of a capital letter T. Each of these were </p><p>slotted across at various points, but no two in </p><p>exactly the same manner, and on them were en- </p><p>graved strange characters. Here is a sketch of </p><p>them.” </p><p> Hargraves handed me a piece of paper on which</p><p>was drawn the figures I reproduce here. </p><p>r + Tr 11 t+ i- </p><p> “The thought struck me at once that these things</p><p>might be keys to unlock whatever lay before me, </p><p>so I tried one in a hole where it fitted snugly. Now, </p><p>I asked myself, into which hole did each key fit. </p><p>There were one-hundred and forty-four holes and </p><p>six keys, so there were evidently 1441/138! (1) </p><p>ways in which these six keys could be arranged, </p><p>using all of them. Out of more than eight trillion </p><p>ways of doing a thing with only one of them cor- </p><p>rect, the chances are somewhat against one’s hit- </p><p>ting the right combination by chance!” </p><p> “You might hit it once in a million years,” I</p><p>laughed, “if you could keep on trying that long.” </p><p> “Well,” he continued, “I saw that there must be</p><p>some solution to my problem, so I looked for a clue </p><p>and found it. One of the corner holes was marked </p><p>I </p><p>while the one diagonally opposite looked like this." </p><p>I" </p><p> He drew these figures as he spoke.</p><p> “On the plate, above what I took to be the top</p><p>of the square, were engraved twelve symbols, like </p><p>this </p><p>•ITT H +1JLI11 </p><p> “After copying these down in my note-book, I</p><p>sat down to think it over. From the occurrence of </p><p>twelves, both in the number of holes and the num- </p><p>ber of symbols, it might be possible, I thought, </p><p>that the duodecimal* system was used by those </p><p>who had made this thing. Following up this </p><p>thought I saw that the symbols were, in order, </p><p>zero to eleven according to our notation, hence the</p><p>first of these keys was number two and the others </p><p>CO, 38, 91, 42 and 108 respectively. </p><p> "Hurriedly I placed the keys in their correspond-</p><p>ing holes and as I did so I felt the wards of the </p><p>lock mechanism engage with the slots. Turning </p><p>the keys as far as they would go I was now able </p><p>to lift the plate with the aid of the boys, using the </p><p>keys as handles. </p><p> “It was thinner than the former one, being about</p><p>a foot or so thick, and as we lifted it I noticed that </p><p>a number of radial bars on the underside had slid </p><p>back into their sockets. </p><p> (1) 144! - 138!

Sac-</p><p>rificing one of my few precious matches I leaned </p><p>as far as I could over the hole. The match burned </p><p>bright and clear; evidently the air inside was pure. </p><p>Just below me I could see what appeared to be a </p><p>platform. Taking a stout stick, long enough to </p><p>reach it, I tested it carefully. It seemed quite </p><p>strong and firm, so taking a chance, I lowered my- </p><p>self into the hole and my feet just touched as I hung </p><p>from the edge with my hands. </p><p> “I could see by the light that filtered in from</p><p>overhead that I was standing on a metal grating. </p><p>It was not level, but tilted downwards to the north. </p><p>As I had suspected, this construction, whatever it </p><p>might be, had fallen over from the vertical and lay </p><p>at an angle on the hillside. </p><p> "Ordering one of the natives to fetch torches, I</p><p>stooped and peered around. I could dimly see that </p><p>I stood on the top of a curved stairway leading </p><p>down into the darkness. Grasping the heavy hand- </p><p>rail with which it was protected I cautiously de- </p><p>scended. I noticed that the steps were abnormally </p><p>high as I went down. Later I was to know the </p><p>reason. A few steps down and I came to another </p><p>platform, which I could make out in the faint light </p><p>as circular, surrounding a ‘well.’ </p><p> "Striking another match, I examined the wall be-</p><p>hind me. In its surface I saw another set of holes </p><p>similar to those in the plate we had removed. My </p><p>match flickered out and, not wanting to waste any</p><p>more of my precious store of them I climbed the </p><p>steps and wriggled out into the daylight to await </p><p>the arrival of the torches. </p><p> “Presently the boy I had sent arrived with a</p><p>goodly load of dry, resinous sticks that would burn </p><p>well and brightly. I lit one, and calling to him to </p><p>follow me, I again lowered myself into the hole, </p><p>remembering to take the keys with me. Stepping </p><p>carefully for fear of falling on the sloping surface, </p><p>I walked around the gallery examining the place. </p><p>It was about twenty feet in diameter with a five- </p><p>foot gallery from which led a second flight of steps. </p><p>There were four sets of key holes in the wall about </p><p>five feet above the floor. </p><p> “The second gallery was exactly like the first and</p><p>I did not stop, but went on down the last flight of </p><p>steps. This was evidently the bottom of the cylin- </p><p>der and, like the other two stories, its walls held </p><p>the now familiar key plates. </p><p> “Going to the one on the lower side I examined it</p><p>closely. Above the square of holes were twelve sets </p><p>of symbols arranged in pairs, the first members of </p><p>these pairs corresponding to the numbers on the </p><p>keys. Evidently the keys did not correspond to the </p><p>same holes as above, so, inserting them in their </p><p>corresponding new numbers, I turned them as I </p><p>had done before. </p><p> ‘‘Immediately, a section of the wall swung inward</p><p>and there was a sudden rush of air which nearly </p><p>extinguished the torch. The air pressure had been </p><p>much less inside the chamber which now lay open </p><p>before me, than outside, and the door was appar- </p><p>ently airtight. No wonder I could see no sign of </p><p>the joint in my first cursory examination of the </p><p>walls. </p><p> "Before me, stacked around the sides, were a</p><p>THE RETREAT TO MARS </p><p>465 </p><p>large number of hox-shaped objects, held in place </p><p>by bars reaching from floor to roof of the chamber, </p><p>each box bearing a number. Removing one of the </p><p>retaining bars, which fitted into sockets, I pulled </p><p>down the top box of the tier. </p><p> “On the front of this box was a lever-like handle,</p><p>this I turned, and as I did so there came the hissing </p><p>sound of air entering a vacuum. Turning the handle </p><p>further—it was quite stiff—the air rushed in with </p><p>a final sigh and the lid of the box raised sufficiently </p><p>for me to put my fingers under it and throw it back. </p><p> "The lever had operated an eccentric which had</p><p>forced the lid up against the pressure of the outside </p><p>air. The lid was tongued, and fitted into a cor- </p><p>responding groove in the upper edge of the box, and </p><p>the groove was filled with a waxy substance which </p><p>had made the joint air tight. I noticed afterwards </p><p>that, each box had a filled hole through which the </p><p>air had evidently been exhausted. </p><p> "Carefully packed in a substance that looked like</p><p>fine steel wool were a number of broad oblong cases, </p><p>about the size of a standard volume of the ‘Encyclo- </p><p>pedia Britannica,’ the topmost of which I removed. </p><p>It was of the same metallic substance that I had en- </p><p>countered all along, and on its edge was a little knob </p><p>set in a recess. This I pressed and a cover flew </p><p>back. </p><p> “It was a volume, and such a volume as the eyes</p><p>of living man never saw before. There before me </p><p>was the most startling illustration I had ever looked </p><p>upon. Instead of the usual lifeless flat things we </p><p>are used to, there lay a picture in three dimensions. </p><p>The illustration depicted an animal or reptile—I </p><p>don’t know which it was—and it stood out there in </p><p>the torch light like a live thing. I ran my fingers </p><p>lightly over the surface to assure myself that it </p><p>was not a model, or in relief, but it was as flat as a </p><p>table top. The colors were marvelous; they had life </p><p>and brightness in them which enhanced the natural </p><p>look about the thing. </p><p> "At the foot of the case in which the picture lay</p><p>was a tiny lever-like arrangement. I pressed this </p><p>over and as I did so there was a tiny whirring sound </p><p>followed by a click, and the picture flicked out of </p><p>sight, and was replaced by another. </p><p> "One-half the page—if I may call them pages—</p><p>was occupied by this new illustration, the other half </p><p>being filled with characters, evidently writing of </p><p>some kind. Page after page flicked by at my touch,</p><p>the majority bearing those wonderfully executed il- </p><p>lustrations in three dimensions. </p><p>«T)OX after box was opened, and each was found </p><p> •D filled with these strange volumes. I carefully</p><p>replaced those I had removed and closed the lids </p><p>of the boxes, replacing them in their tiers. </p><p> “Where was I going to start in this place? I</p><p>felt like a child surrounded by novel toys, not know- </p><p>ing which to examine first. Then it occurred to me </p><p>that everything was arranged in a methodical man- </p><p>ner—the numbering of the cases and the volumes </p><p>showed this. Looking on the door of this cell I saw </p><p>something I had overlooked before. It was num- </p><p>bered ten. according to our notation. Number one </p><p>must, he on the first landing. </p><p> "The air was becoming thick and suffocating with</p><p>the oily smoke of the torches, but I made my way to </p><p>the first cell and opened it in its turn. Being warned </p><p>this time, I had the boy stand back with the torch </p><p>so that it would not be blown out. The pressure </p><p>here was much lower than in the other cell. I was </p><p>nearly overthrown by the sudden gust of air that </p><p>drove in before me as the door swung back. </p><p> “This chamber was similar to the one below, and</p><p>in the topmost row of boxes I saw number one in a </p><p>corner. I removed this case and, as the air was be- </p><p>coming unbearable, I took it out into the sunlight </p><p>to examine it. </p><p> "ft contained what I may liken to a child’s primer,</p><p>profusely illustrated. The first volume was filled </p><p>with pictures of common objects, each with a few </p><p>symbols at the sides. Trees, rivers, lakes and </p><p>mountains; birds, beasts and reptiles, the majority </p><p>of which were unknown to me, were illustrated. The </p><p>second volume contained composite pictures—simple </p><p>actions of human-like creatures and so on. I saw </p><p>at once that it would be quite easy for a man of </p><p>average intelligence to learn this unknown language </p><p>with the aid of this wonderful primer. To one who </p><p>was accustomed to deciphering old writings, as I </p><p>was, the task would be ridiculously easy. </p><p> “The setting of the sun drove me back to camp,</p><p>but not before I had replaced and locked the place, </p><p>taking the keys with me. </p><p> "By the light of the fire T studied my trophies</p><p>that night. It might interest you to know just how </p><p>the ‘lessons’ were arranged. Take for example the </p><p>verb ‘to walk.’ In one set of pictures a being was </p><p>shown in the foreground, approaching a hill. The</p><p>second showed him, bent forward, walking up the </p><p>hill, while a third showed him at the top. The </p><p>characters were exactly the same in each case, but </p><p>over the first was an inverted V; over the second, </p><p>nothing; and over the third a V. The tenses were </p><p>all indicated by a symbol above the verb. The de- </p><p>grees of adjectives were similarly indicated, hence </p><p>it simplified the written language exceedingly. </p><p> "I sat and studied well into the night until weari-</p><p>ness compelled me to cease, but at dawn I was awake </p><p>and at it again. Throughout the day I worked, hav- </p><p>ing given instructions to the boys to continue their </p><p>work of removing the earth from around the cylin- </p><p>der. </p><p> “Every moment the system of writing became</p><p>clearer, until late in the afternoon I came to a lone </p><p>sentence set out in large characters. A rough trans- </p><p>lation of it would be: </p><p> “WE GREET YOU. CONTINUE, WE HAVE</p><p>MUCH IN STORE FOR YOU.’ </p><p> “Here was a direct message, and a message that</p><p>made my heart leap. If I had worked hard up to </p><p>this point. I worked feverishly now. Who, I won- </p><p>dered, were ‘WE’? </p><p> “The following day another message was trans-</p><p>lated. Tt read: </p><p> ‘THE PEOPLE OF ANOTHER WORLD</p><p> GREET YOU.’</p><p> “I checked my translation again and again, but</p><p>I had made no mistake. That was the meaning of </p><p>the sentence. </p><p> “As the days slipped by I came across more of</p><p>these interpolated sentences, all encouraging me to </p><p>go on. This personal touch made me feel as though </p><p>466 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>there were some beings anxious for my advance- </p><p>ment so that they could communicate with me. </p><p> “The days grew into weeks before I had mastered</p><p>the language sufficiently for the purpose of those </p><p>who wrote it. In the meantime the natives had </p><p>progressed with their task but slowly, due to the </p><p>poor implements with which they had to work. They </p><p>worked slowly but honestly, so I did not press them, </p><p>for I could see I had months of work ahead of me </p><p>before I even scratched the surface of the wonder- </p><p>ful store of knowledge that lay before me. </p><p> “We were truly in a Garden of Eden, for game</p><p>and fish abounded, while edible fruits and berries </p><p>served to keep down sickness, which would surely </p><p>have followed a meat diet. In this way I was able </p><p>to conserve our none too plentiful supply of pro- </p><p>visions. The head boy was an excellent shot, so our </p><p>ammunition was not wasted as it would have been </p><p>had we depended upon my powers with a rifle. The </p><p>climate was almost perfect. </p><p> “Eventually I arrived at the end of my primary</p><p>course and came, at the end of the last volume, to </p><p>a message which read—‘First read volume one, case </p><p>three. A complete catalogue of the contents of the </p><p>library will also be found in this case.’ </p><p> "This volume was soon secured, and without hesi-</p><p>tation I plunged into it. It was written in a fairly </p><p>simple style, and with the aid of an excellent dic- </p><p>tionary I found in the same case, I was able to read </p><p>right through. I read it in four days, hardly stop- </p><p>ping to eat or sleep, nearly ruining my eyesight with </p><p>the strain. After that I slackened up a bit and did </p><p>manual work at intervals in order to get some exer- </p><p>cise. I will outline the contents of this volume to </p><p>you. </p><p> CHAPTER III</p><p>(( ( T TUNDREDS of thousands of years be- </p><p>I—I fore this story opens, intelligent life </p><p>X X had dawned upon one of our nearest </p><p>neighbors in space, the planet Mars: in much the </p><p>same manner as we have supposed it to do on this </p><p>Earth of ours, so that at the time this narrative </p><p>was written civilization had reached a very high </p><p>plane. The records show that they had reached </p><p>what we might call the ideal state. Every being was </p><p>intelligent enough to work under what I might call </p><p>a system of social democracy. </p><p> “ ‘Every member of the planet’s teeming millions</p><p>was an integral part of a smoothly working system</p><p>in which no parasites existed, for when one, by some </p><p>atavistic freak, did turn up who attempted to </p><p>"throw a monkey-wrench into the machinery” he </p><p>was simply exterminated. </p><p> “ ‘Throughout, the ages, while this system was</p><p>slowly being built up, the race had been carefully </p><p>developed by intelligent selection in mating and </p><p>every undesirable feature had been slowly elimi- </p><p>nated. The result was that at the time this narra- </p><p>tive opens every man and woman on the planet was </p><p>both mentally and physically perfect. </p><p> " 'As time went on it became apparent that the</p><p>life of the planet would be shortened by the loss of </p><p>air and water vapor. The gravitation on the sur- </p><p>face of Mars being much less than on the Earth, </p><p>nearly one-half as great, the gases of its atmosphere </p><p>would more readily escape. The Kinetic Theory of </p><p>Gases shows that a velocity of seven miles a second </p><p>is readily obtained by the faster moving molecules </p><p>of water vapor. This is the critical speed for escape </p><p>from the Earth’s attraction. How much more read- </p><p>ily will the water vapor escape from a planet like </p><p>Mars. </p><p> “ 'Some scheme had to be developed then, in order</p><p>to reduce this rapid escape of the planet’s vital </p><p>fluid, if life on the planet was to be possible in </p><p>future ages. </p><p> “ *Martian engineers set to work, after due delib-</p><p>eration, to construct gigantic underground reser- </p><p>voirs lined with an impervious material. After </p><p>nearly a thousand years’ labor the work was finished </p><p>and the waters of the lakes and seas were impounded </p><p>in these vast underground storage basins. </p><p> ‘“To conserve the precious liquid still further,</p><p>that which was deposited as snow in the polar re- </p><p>gions was carefully trapped as the summer sun </p><p>melted it. Huge subterranean aqueducts led it back </p><p>equator-wards, assisted by enormous pumping </p><p>plants. These conduits were tapped at intervals by </p><p>lateral lines in order to supply water to irrigate the </p><p>fast drying surface, and at the time the record was </p><p>written, the construction of an intricate system of </p><p>conduits and pumping stations was well under </p><p>way.’ ” </p><p> "Just as the late Professor Lowell hypothecated,”</p><p>I exclaimed, to which Hargraves added: </p><p> "And those oases, as Lowell called them, were the</p><p>locations of the pumping stations, the intensely cul- </p><p>tivated area around them causing them to show up </p><p>as black dots on the planet’s surface, as your ob-</p><p>servations showed. </p><p> “The prominent blue-green markings on our</p><p>neighbor in space are of a heavier soil and are the </p><p>old sea beds. The lighter sandy soils were aban- </p><p>doned, because of the large quantity of water neces- </p><p>sary to make them fertile, save along the lines of </p><p>the canals. But to continue— </p><p> " ‘With their highly developed instruments the</p><p>Martians had ascertained that their neighboring </p><p>planet, the Earth, was well suited to support life. </p><p>Indeed it seemed a veritable land of promise to </p><p>them, with its vast oceans and verdant continents. </p><p>Encouraged by the thought of the possibilities this </p><p>new world held for them, researches were instituted </p><p>which resulted in a machine which would travel </p><p>through interplanetary space. The method of pro- </p><p>pulsion was similar to that of the "Goddard Rock- </p><p>et”: gases formed by the combination of certain </p><p>solid chemicals, escaping through specially shaped </p><p>nozzles attached to the after part of the machine </p><p>propelled it in exactly the same manner as our sky- </p><p>rockets are shot aloft. </p><p> " ‘Wing-shaped members supported it in the air</p><p>until its velocity was high enough for it to leave the </p><p>atmosphere, while a second series of nozzles in </p><p>the bow of the craft retarded it when a landing had </p><p>to be made. </p><p> “ ‘A company of daring pioneers left one eventful</p><p>day to commence the first interplanetary navigation </p><p>our solar system has known, and after months of an </p><p>uneventful journey, landed safely on the Earth. An </p><p>unforeseen disaster overtook this adventurous com </p><p>pany, however. Under the greater gravitational </p><p>force to which they were subjected here, their rela- </p><p>THE RETREAT TO MARS </p><p>467 </p><p>tively frail bodies broke down. Prolapse of their </p><p>inner organs caused many to die in agony within a </p><p>*	month of their landing, so the project was aban-</p><p> doned and the survivors returned to their native</p><p> planet.</p><p> “ ‘Undaunted by this failure they set to work to</p><p> develop a race capable of withstanding the new con-</p><p> ditions, After a lapse of nearly four hundred years</p><p> a new expedition set forth. This second party was</p><p> more successful than the first, and succeeded in</p><p> founding a colony on the high plateau region where</p><p> the cylinder was found. Their bodies were skill-</p><p> fully braced by a metal framework which relieved,</p><p> to some extent, the strain to which they were sub-</p><p> jected.</p><p> “‘These first intelligent inhabitants of the Earth</p><p> were giants compared with us. Their average height</p><p> was about nine feet; their lungs, which were de-</p><p> veloped to accommodate the rarer atmosphere of</p><p> Mars, were enclosed by a barrel-like chest, but their</p><p> limbs were pitifully thin, though much better</p><p> adapted to their new environment than those of</p><p> their predecessors.</p><p> “ ‘As time went on children were born into this</p><p> new world and new arrivals came across the gulf</p><p> every two years when Mars was in opposition*.</p><p> Then came another catastrophe. As the children</p><p> born here grew, it was noticed that their intelli-</p><p> gence was inferior to that of their parents. Bodily</p><p> they were smaller and sturdier, but their mentality</p><p> when they reached the adult stage was only equiva-</p><p> lent to that of a Martian child half their age.</p><p> “ ‘Immigration stopped while this new phase was</p><p> anxiously watched. Everything within the Mar-</p><p> tians’ power was done to check this effect, but with-</p><p> out avail. Things went from bad to worse as the</p><p> second generation was born, for these were still</p><p> farther from the high mental standard of their fore-</p><p> fathers. Instead of highly intelligent beings, the</p><p> race was rapidly reverting to the primitive state.</p><p> ‘“The fourth generation was but a grotesque</p><p> caricature of the original stock, and were already</p><p> forming into bands of nomadic savages, leaving the</p><p> center of their community to wander at large over</p><p> the face of the Earth.</p><p> " ‘Everything within the power of the Martians</p><p> having failed to alleviate these conditions, the pro-</p><p> jected plan was abandoned. Before leaving this</p><p> planet forever, to return to their own sphere, it</p><p> was decided to build a monument to their endeavors,</p><p> so that as time went on and intelligence again re-</p><p> turned to this planet, a record of their attempt, and</p><p> data of the most useful kind, would be available to</p><p> those who found it.</p><p> “ ‘Two other cylinders, similar in every respect</p><p> to the one I found, were constructed of a tough non-</p><p> corrosive metal which would withstand the destruc-</p><p> tive forces of the elements throughout the ages until</p><p> intelligence again appeared. This period has been</p><p> much longer than was anticipated by the builders,</p><p> I can see from what I have read.

One where I found it, an- </p><p>other somewhere on a continent over which the </p><p>Atlantic now rolls, and the last in the continent </p><p>which we know as Australia. This latter may yet </p><p>be found. The cylinders were sealed in the manner </p><p>I have described so that none but intelligent beings </p><p>could gain access to them. They were so constructed </p><p>that should they break they would do so midway </p><p>between the dividing partitions of the cells, thus </p><p>leaving each cell intact until someone should arrive </p><p>who could solve the riddle of the system of numerals </p><p>and make keys to fit the locks. </p><p> “ ‘This planet and all their works were then aban-</p><p>doned. Practically all other traces of their sojourn </p><p>have now vanished into dust, though here and there </p><p>I found remains of their supporting harness, for </p><p>which they had used this remarkable metal, which </p><p>is, I believe, akin to aluminum.’ ” </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>( i T~\ Y the time my cursory survey of the con- </p><p>tents of the library was completed, the </p><p>MlJ natives had succeeded in clearing away </p><p>the mass of earth around the cylinder, so that I was </p><p>better able to understand its construction and what </p><p>had happened to it throughout the ages. </p><p> “The walls of the object were approximately six</p><p>feet thick with the top and bottom of convex form, </p><p>better to withstand any great pressure to which it </p><p>might be subjected. The whole structure was of one </p><p>seamless piece, unbroken save where the manhole </p><p>gave access to its interior. Four massive, equally </p><p>spaced spokes, or ribs, radiated out from the cylin-</p><p>der, the object of these being to prevent the cylin </p><p>der rolling over as the soil subsided. The cylinder </p><p>was approximately forty feet high and sixty in di- </p><p>ameter. The arrangement of the interior I have </p><p>already described to you. </p><p> "Originally the structure had rested on the stir</p><p>face of a hard limestone formation, but the gradual </p><p>weathering of this had caused it to sink downwards </p><p>into the little valley which now exists there. </p><p> “Having completed my examination of the cylin</p><p>der and satisfied myself that there was nothing </p><p>more to be learned until other volumes were trans- </p><p>lated, I carefully sealed and locked the entrance, </p><p>after selecting a few of what I deemed the most im- </p><p>portant records to take away with me. The keys </p><p>I sewed into a canvas belt which I strapped about, </p><p>my waist and, packing the remaining trophies very </p><p>carefully, we retraced our steps to the coast. </p><p> “Eight months after leaving the valley I was once</p><p>more in Washington where I laid my discoveries be- </p><p>fore the departmental heads. It was decided to keep </p><p>the thing secret until an expedition could go to </p><p>Africa and return with the remainder of the library. </p><p>I expect that we shall be hearing from them in a </p><p>few months’ time, if all goes well. </p><p> “Among the volumes I brought out with me was</p><p>this one,” Hargraves said, reaching for the pack- </p><p>age he had brought with him. </p><p> Unwrapping it, he handed me a lustrous metal</p><p>box such as he had described. I took it and pressed </p><p>the spring at the side. The cover, which I may </p><p>liken to the front board of our books, flew hack. </p><p> There before me, apparently floating in space,</p><p>was the representation of a sphere. So real was the </p><p>468 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>three-dimensional aspect of the thing that I could </p><p>not resist passing my fingers over its surface to </p><p>assure myself that it really was in one plane. It </p><p>was an illustration of the planet of mystery—Mars. </p><p>At the poles glistened twin polar caps, the northern </p><p>one surrounded by a hazy outline while the southern </p><p>was belted with a liquid-blue band. It was evi- </p><p>dently the fall of the year in the planet’s northern </p><p>hemisphere. </p><p> I recognized some of the principal features—</p><p>Utopia, the Syrtis Major and the Pseboas Lucus* </p><p>(1)—though there were other blue-green markings </p><p>with which I was not familiar The desert areas, I </p><p>paw at once, were much smaller than they are today </p><p>and only a few canals were shown. </p><p> I stopped to examine the "page” on which it was</p><p>depicted. Like the case, it was of metal, and ap- </p><p>peared to pass over a roller, like the film of a cam- </p><p>era. Afterwards I learned that it was on an endless </p><p>belt arrangement, passing over a series of small </p><p>rollers which kept the metal sheet from coming into </p><p>contact with itself. Had this precaution not been </p><p>taken there was a danger of the sheets cohering </p><p>and being irreparably ruined. </p><p> Pressing the little lever-like arrangement at the</p><p>lower end of the case as my companion directed, the </p><p>picture flicked out of sight revealing another view </p><p>of the planet. A series of such views gave details </p><p>of every portion of the planet’s surface and then I </p><p>came to a different type of picture. </p><p> It was an illustration showing a gigantic engi-</p><p>neering undertaking. A low range of hills formed </p><p>the background and down their slope ran a great </p><p>scar. At the foot was a vast building under con- </p><p>struction, and leading from it to the foreground </p><p>was an immense excavation at the bottom of which </p><p>were what I took to be excavating machines, whose </p><p>apparent size was enhanced by the diminutive, </p><p>human-like figures I could see here and there among </p><p>them. </p><p> Translating the legend below, Hargraves inform-</p><p>ed me that this illustrated one of the canals under </p><p>construction and that the building at the foot of </p><p>the hill housed the pumping mechanism which was </p><p>to raise the water to its new level. This particular </p><p>piece of work was at what we call the northern </p><p>point of the Trivium Charontis* (2). </p><p> Page after page flicked before me on the pressing</p><p>of the lever. Great engineering works, maps and</p><p>plans of districts and cities, and last of all views </p><p>of the cities themselves. These latter illustrations </p><p>are well worth describing. Unlike our canyon-like </p><p>streets the ways received sunlight in abundance, for </p><p>the buildings were pyramidal in form, each story </p><p>being smaller than the one below, with a broad open </p><p>space running around it. A reddish stone seemed </p><p>to be used in their construction, with a trimming of </p><p>*(1) The reader is recommended to read "The Planet </p><p>Mars,” “Mars and its Canals,” and "Mars as the Abode of </p><p>Life.”—three volumes written by the late Professor Per- </p><p>cival Lowell, who observed Mars systematically for twenty </p><p>years, mostly at Flagstaff.

A flaming Sun, crossed parallel lines, a </p><p>square and compass, and a cluster of fruits were </p><p>among some of those I saw. I will leave it to the </p><p>reader’s imagination to solve the meanings of these </p><p>symbols. </p><p> Another view showed the stages from which great</p><p>aerial liners left for distant cities, or to which they </p><p>came to discharge their living cargo. A few were </p><p>resting upon their cradles, taking aboard freight </p><p>and passengers, or discharging the products of dis- </p><p>tant districts into conveyors which took it rapidly </p><p>underground. All heavy traffic was carried under- </p><p>ground in the cities, I was informed, and came to </p><p>the surface only at its destination. </p><p> "To think that this was taking place half-a-mil-</p><p>lion years ago,” I said to my companion. “I wonder </p><p>what it is like there now.” </p><p> “Some day we may learn,” he replied. “They</p><p>may have progressed but little and may be passively </p><p>waiting until our intelligence is high enough to </p><p>make it worth their while to communicate with us. </p><p>Think of the difference in intelligence which must </p><p>exist between us! Perhaps as much as between man- </p><p>kind and the apes. We would not think of estab- </p><p>lishing communication with monkeys, would we? </p><p>Then we must not expect to hear from our neigh- </p><p>bors until we begin to approach their standard of </p><p>intelligence.” </p><p> It was late that night when my visitor left, very</p><p>kindly leaving the volume behind for my further </p><p>perusal and with a promise to aid me by interpret- </p><p>ing the accompanying text. Without his aid I would </p><p>not have been able to make much of it, and would </p><p>perhaps have come to many erroneous conclusions. </p><p> The following days, with Hargraves’ assistance,</p><p>I studied it thoroughly, comparing the maps with </p><p>my own drawings and checking up much of my ob- </p><p>servational data. </p><p> I have written down this story so that time would</p><p>not cause me to forget the finer details.

Still he could hardly avoid </p><p>the suspicion that some- </p><p>thing out of the ordinary —^■ </p><p>had disturbed him; and, </p><p>with blinking eyes, he </p><p>searched the apartment </p><p>for possible inordinate </p><p>things. </p><p> The first to attract his</p><p>attention was a neatly </p><p>folded copy of the eleven </p><p>o’clock edition of the </p><p>Hourly Bulletin, bearing </p><p>the date: “Tuesday, Jan- </p><p>uary 7, 2025”; which, with its “up-to-the-minute” </p><p>Wall street market quotations, lay unread upon </p><p>the desk before him. This he swept to the floor </p><p>with an impatient sweep of his arm! </p><p> Next his left hand instinctively sought, with</p><p>practiced precision, a black bottle on a side-desk </p><p>close by. Holding the bottle to the light, his eyes </p><p>told him that it was empty. Tipping it upside- </p><p> down above his wide-open mouth, his tongue re-</p><p>peated the information with emphasis. Dejectedly </p><p>keeping the bottle before him, he glared in an in- </p><p>sane fury at two green labels—one the trade mark </p><p>of a by-gone century, and the other a “Bottled in </p><p>Bond” stamp dated: “July 1, 1916”—which his wis- </p><p>dom told him were both forgeries. </p><p> Then, as the topographical details of his “den”</p><p>became clearer to his </p><p>blurred vision, his eyes </p><p>picked out the recumbent </p><p>form of his correctly at- </p><p>tired and correctly featur- </p><p>ed valet slumbering peace- </p><p>fully and audibly in a </p><p>Morris chair in the far </p><p>corner—and this under</p><p>the very nose of his mas- </p><p>ter! Instantly the bottle; </p><p>---- ■ - was hurled at the valet’s </p><p> head!—and the latter,</p><p>promptly proved his trained efficiency in the art of </p><p>sleeping “with one eye open,” by automatically and </p><p>unnecessarily dodging. </p><p> Finally Algernon’s superheated emotions found</p><p>vent in speech.

As you say, sir! But, begging your</p><p>pardon, sir, the gentleman sent word yesterday that </p><p>you should not drink any of that, as it was danger- </p><p>ous. He said, begging your pardon, sir, that the </p><p>goods they make for the common people had been </p><p>sent you by mistake.

Here, s’take thish.” </p><p>And Algernon took a bill from his pocket and tossed </p><p>it at his valet. </p><p> For a moment he sat quietly as if in a profound</p><p>study, and then another idea struck him. </p><p> “Shay you schrimp! Whash shtaring t’me like</p><p>owl for?” he said, addressing the valet. “Gesh </p><p>bishy on ’phone, tell booshlegger-dog shend me </p><p>'nozzer case quick.

"But, begging your pardon, sir, the </p><p>gentleman did promise to send another case yester- </p><p>day: and, begging your pardon, sir, I believe he </p><p>would have done so, if the federal officers had not </p><p>raided him and put him in jail.” </p><p> For a moment Algernon stared at his valet in a</p><p>speechless rage that partly sobered him. Then the </p><p>words came in a torrent of choice but incoherent </p><p>invective. </p><p> “Whazzat!” he cried. “Thosh—curs gesh my</p><p>booshlegger! I gesh them quick!” </p><p> He paused a second for breath, eyeing his valet</p><p>the while with maudlin profundity, and then he </p><p>continued: </p><p> “Shay you monkey-face’ weptile, whash shtaring</p><p>me for?” he exploded. “Gesh bishy!

As you say,</p><p>sir!” the valet obeyed promptly, and was soon </p><p>buried in his master’s private code-book; while </p><p>Algernon, now considerably sobered by his rage, </p><p>became fully conscious of the peculiar buzzing sen- </p><p>sation in the region of his upper left-hand vest </p><p>pocket—and of the fact that this buzzing indi- </p><p>cated beyond a doubt that his fiancee, Esmeralda </p><p>Clementine Jones-Bronson, desired to communicate </p><p>with him. </p><p> Well versed as he was in the art of “managing”</p><p>the “female-of-the-species” in the infinite variety </p><p>of moods to which she is addicted, a quizzical smile </p><p>played for a moment around his lips as he realized </p><p>that his inadvertent delay in answering his Esmer- </p><p>alda’s “call,” had accidentally turned out a master- </p><p>stroke. She had "ridden her high horse” in the </p><p>recent row, had flaunted a daring defiance of his </p><p>most earnest wishes in his very face, and had fin- </p><p>ished by throwing her engagement-ring contemptu- </p><p>ously at his feet! Presumably she was contrite </p><p>now, and ready for a reconciliation. But he well </p><p>knew that, if he would not be bullied through life </p><p>by his future wife, he must maintain the upper </p><p>hand throughout the engagement period; and—his </p><p>delay in answering would have a chastening effect! </p><p>'T'HE row had started when he presented Esmer- </p><p> A alda, as a birthday present, with one of two</p><p>specially-designed miniature radio receiving-and- </p><p>broadcasting sets. His own carried the equipment </p><p>in a small gold case in his vest pocket; while the </p><p>wiring, the antenna, and the steel frame which held </p><p>the head-phone in place with microphone pendant </p><p>before the mouth, was coiled and folded in a tiny </p><p>golden receptacle on the outside of the pocket. The</p><p>steel wiring was “Electro re-tempered” by a new </p><p>process, which increased its tensile strength one </p><p>hundred fold; while the copper was first tempered </p><p>by the re-discovered process which for centuries </p><p>had been a "lost art,” and then “Electro re-tem- </p><p>pered” the same as the steel. So that, while of </p><p>gossamer-like delicacy in appearance, the whole </p><p>apparatus was in fact much stronger than the old </p><p>styles. Both sets were permanently adjusted to the </p><p>delicately-complicated, alternating “E.V.R.-X.Y.Z.” </p><p>wavelength, which the makers believed proof </p><p>against duplication, and which they guaranteed </p><p>against static within a radius of 10,000 miles under </p><p>any possible conditions. The cover of the outer </p><p>receptacle of his own set was in shape a gold shield, </p><p>with a “spread-eagle” engraved rampant upon a </p><p>South Sea Island golden-sunset field 011 its face. </p><p>This was liable to be mistaken, by its appearance, </p><p>for a decoration of European royalty; and Es- </p><p>meralda had agreed with him that it was quite </p><p>nifty. </p><p> But hers was contained in the back of a “veri-</p><p>thin” wrist watch, and that was where the trouble </p><p>started. She wanted a lavalliere as a decoration </p><p>for her bosom! And, growing sarcastic towards </p><p>the last, he had admitted that that portion of her </p><p>anatomy did need some kind of covering: but he </p><p>had denied the efficacy of the “lavalliere” idea for </p><p>that special purpose. He had contended that both </p><p>the d6collett6 in the front and the “open-back” fea- </p><p>tures of her gowns, should stop at the “lines of </p><p>curvature.” He had even launched into a general </p><p>tirade against a number of her recent costumes, - </p><p>and had called them “picture-frame” conceptions; </p><p>because "they performed a similar function,” in </p><p>that "they merely furnished the setting for empha- </p><p>sizing the details of the things revealed.” </p><p> That, as he had believed, had settled their argu-</p><p>ment! But two days before this, she had appeared </p><p>ELECTRO-EPISODED IN A.D. 2025 </p><p>471 </p><p>adorned with the best that Wertheimer, the Paris </p><p>arbiter of the world’s fashions, could devise in the </p><p>way of a realization of his “picture-frame” sar- </p><p>casm; and the row that resulted had, this time, </p><p>been hectic on both sides—with her scoring the </p><p>final “point” by throwing her engagement ring at </p><p>his feet. </p><p> Then, through the great "Electro-visional” dial</p><p>attached to his general radio outfit, he had watched </p><p>her “take off” from the roof in her runabout mono- </p><p>plane, had noted the reckless speed with which she </p><p>drove it through the air, had chuckled when an </p><p>aerial speed-cop took her license number and </p><p>“tagged” her by shooting the citation into the rear </p><p>of her machine, had seen her land on her own roof </p><p>and, a moment later, had watched her “take off” </p><p>again in her large touring biplane and rapidly grow </p><p>into a tiny speck in the western sky. Evidently his </p><p>Esmeralda was a high-strung thoroughbred, who </p><p>meant business when her dander was up! </p><p> For a brief moment Algernon made a profound</p><p>effort to solve the problem as to just how long he </p><p>should keep her waiting before he answered her </p><p>“call.” The nice adjustment of time to the particu- </p><p>lar individuality of the person concerned under the </p><p>correlated circumstances enumerated, was a matter </p><p>of supreme importance! Then, suddenly, the idea </p><p>occurred that she might have met with an accident. </p><p>Instantly he acted! </p><p> Touching a spring on the golden radio-receptacle</p><p>on his vest pocket, he caught the released frame- </p><p>work in his hand, slipped the catch that allowed it </p><p>to snap into shape, and quickly adju.sted it to his </p><p>face. Then, choosing his words carefully and spar- </p><p>ingly, he spoke into the pendant microphone with </p><p>an attempted precision to conceal his thick tongue, </p><p>asking: </p><p> “This you, Esm'alda?”</p><p> “Yes, this is me!” she snapped back promptly.</p><p>“Who did you suppose it was? Have you been </p><p>giving away any more of these ‘special’ radio sets </p><p>to any other female? If I catch you playing any </p><p>tricks on me with any other huzzy, I’ll make you </p><p>wish that you had never been born! If—” </p><p> Patiently, and speaking more clearly than before,</p><p>Algernon stopped the flow of words by interjecting </p><p>another query. </p><p> “Want an’thin’ p'ticular?” he asked.</p><p> “Yes! I want help quick-—right this minute,” she</p><p>answered. “My leg is broken and I can’t move, and </p><p>there is a nasty big tiger on the ledge right over </p><p>my head just ready to spring on me and eat me up! </p><p>I was (lying west in my big ’plane, and 1 was out </p><p>of our district where everybody knows me and papa </p><p>has them all ‘fixed,’ and I was away out here where </p><p>nobody knows me, and one of those beastly ‘Purity </p><p>League’ sleuths caught me powdering my nose, and </p><p>he chased me, and I ‘stepped on the gas’ and hit the </p><p>two-hundred-miles-an-hour clip, and I thought of </p><p>that new ‘Electric Spark-screen Broadcaster’ you </p><p>had attached to the ’plane, and I turned that loose, </p><p>and then I circled behind the screen, and that brute </p><p>must have chased me into the ocean, for I ran </p><p>straight into this mountain before I could see where </p><p>I was going, and I fell a thousand feet or more, and </p><p>I broke my leg so I can’t move, and that horrid </p><p>tiger—” </p><p> Algernon’s stoppage of the verbal torrent was de-</p><p>cidedly impatient this time. </p><p> “Shay lis’en,” he broke in. “If you don’t tell</p><p>where at, I can’t find you. Tell in code.” </p><p> “Ain’t 1 telling you just as fast as I can?” she</p><p>retorted. “I’ve been talking just as fast as I could </p><p>make my tongue go ever since you finally answered </p><p>me, and you took an awful long time in answering, </p><p>and 1 can’t tell you where I am at if you don’t </p><p>let me talk, and 1 think you are a brute, and I be- </p><p>lieve you are still drunk, and here is the location in </p><p>code: ‘693-1-41: 396^1-141: 356-1-22: 690-2-142: </p><p>and be sure you put it down on paper right away </p><p>so you don’t forget, and—” </p><p> But Algernon had “hung up.”</p><p> By now he was sober enough to realize that he</p><p>was not sober enough for the task in hand, so he </p><p>quickly snapped the bracelets of an “Electric Re- </p><p>generator around his wrists, set the regulator at </p><p>“2 seconds,” lapsed into unconsciousness—and </p><p>awoke at the end of that time an entirely different </p><p>man, as the result of the equivalent of two nights’ </p><p>natural sleep. </p><p>HIS first move on awakening, was to reach for </p><p>a button in the desk before him marked “Pack- </p><p>age Transporter”; but he paused with the move- </p><p>ment half completed, as a look of pain distorted his </p><p>face. For a moment he clasped both hands across </p><p>his forehead, moaning, in helpless misery: “My </p><p>God ! What a headache!” </p><p> His helplessness, however, was only temporary.</p><p>Turning to a silver urn behind him, which bore the </p><p>golden-inlaid legend: “Pasteurized Water,” he </p><p>pressed what appeared to be a part of a carved </p><p>figure in the mahogany base and a secret drawer </p><p>shot out revealing a number of coffee cups, spoons </p><p>and a box of tablets labeled: “Equivalent—2 Spoons </p><p>Sugar and 1 Jigger Cream.” Dropping one of these </p><p>tablets and a spoon into a oup, he set it down on </p><p>his desk. Next he took a diminutive collapsible </p><p>microscope, with a lens of flexible glass, out of his </p><p>pocket: and, with its aid, picked out an all-but- </p><p>invisible needle-point concealed in the filigree orna- </p><p>mentation of the faucet of the urn. This he pressed </p><p>with his finger nail. Then he pushed a button in </p><p>the faucet labeled “Hot,” and filled the coffee cup </p><p>as he mumbled jubilantly to himself: “Some trick </p><p>this! You get your ‘pasteurized water’ according </p><p>to government regulations all right, but—oh! You </p><p>naughty little needle.” He eyed the dubious looking </p><p>mixture that flowed into the cup for a suspicious </p><p>moment, tasted it hopefully—and then, livid with </p><p>rage, spat the stuff out and hurled the cup across </p><p>the room. </p><p> Speechless for a moment, he controlled himself</p><p>with an effort; and then, with desperate haste, un- </p><p>locked a private drawer in his desk and opened it </p><p>half-way to a visible line. Pulling a cord hanging </p><p>over his head, which started an electric fan going— </p><p>and which, in this precise connection, also caused </p><p>a slight orifice in the panel of the drawer to unfold, </p><p>revealing an assortment of crystalline-white and </p><p>brownish-looking pills—he selected one of the white </p><p>pills, placed it in his mouth and crunched it be- </p><p>tween his teeth to get quick action, in spite of his </p><p>vigilant valet’s “Begging your pardon, sir,” pro- </p><p>test. </p><p>472 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> "Can’t help it, John,” he said. ‘This is a real</p><p>emergency and I simply have got to have some- </p><p>thing. On the face of things, it looks like the nar- </p><p>cotics are the only genuine stuff left to us by the </p><p>‘Bootlegger-Smuggler-Prohibitionist Combine’.” </p><p> The look of pain fhat had distorted his features</p><p>quickly disappeared, and in its place there came the </p><p>comforting jubilance of an anticipated pleasure. </p><p>Turning to a combination-lock to the cash drawer of </p><p>his desk; he set the knob at “0,” turned it forward </p><p>to "20,” back to “15,” forward again to “2,” back </p><p>to “1,” again forward to “3,” back a full revolution </p><p>again to “3” and lastly forward to the final “15.” </p><p>Then he applied a firm, steady pressure to the knob, </p><p>and a circular segment of the floor upon which the </p><p>desk stood, and whose scarcely discernable outline </p><p>blended so perfectly with the inlaid floral scroll de- </p><p>sign of the floor as to appear an integral part of it, </p><p>revolved half-around, disclosing a considerable com- </p><p>partment filled with sealed tins of tobacco, and a </p><p>varied assortment of pipes. Filling a "briar” from </p><p>a half-empty tin, he adjusted the patent “Smoke </p><p>Consumer,” pushed a button in the desk which </p><p>caused the room to be sprayed with an atomized </p><p>disinfectant which deodorized the fumes and pre- </p><p>vented external detection of the felonious act, “lit </p><p>up,” and took long, deep draughts at the pipe. The </p><p>eerene content of an anticipated joy realized, stole </p><p>over his face; and, discreetly to himself, he mur- </p><p>mured defiantly: “The skunks caught me napping </p><p>with their ‘Anti-coffee law all right, but I was </p><p>‘Johnnie-on-the-spot’ when they prohibited tobacco, </p><p>and I prepared myself for life.” </p><p> Then, with clear-headed precision, he proceeded</p><p>to business. </p><p> Instructing his valet to make careful notations on</p><p>a tablet to avoid mistakes, he dictated: </p><p> “As soon as you are through with that booze-pro-</p><p>hibition officer, prepare a message in code for this </p><p>white-livered rat who sold me this trick (pointing </p><p>to the urn). Tell him to take back this synthetic </p><p>'Coffee Extract’ he stung me with, and credit its </p><p>cost on my account. I won’t pay for it. Tell him </p><p>to send me at once one gallon- genuine centuple </p><p>extract of Mocha coffee, if he has it—and be sure </p><p>to emphasize the ‘genuine.’ If he hasn’t the </p><p>Mocha, tell him to get it as soon as possible; and, </p><p>in the meantime, he shall send me one gill of </p><p>any genuine (emphasize that ‘genuine’) coffee </p><p>extract that he has. If he claims that he can’t </p><p>get the genuine through—as he probably will,</p><p>for the crook is without doubt trying to ‘bull the </p><p>market’—tell him that I know positively that he is </p><p>in with the opium-smuggling gang, that I know he </p><p>can get the genuine coffee through just as they get </p><p>genuine dope through, if he wants to; and that </p><p>I will set the federal officers after him, and see to </p><p>it that he gets life, if he is gay with me. Get the </p><p>fact into the numskull’s head, if you can, that he </p><p>is dealing with Algernon Sidney St. Johnstone and </p><p>not with one of the common people!” </p><p> With the dictation completed, Algernon suddenly</p><p>became conscious of the fact that his system was </p><p>demanding sustenance after his prolonged fast—in </p><p>plain words, that he was vulgarly hungry—and so, </p><p>having no time to partake of a regulation repast in </p><p>the regulation manner, he pulled a gold case from </p><p>his pocket, extracted a couple of tablets stamped: </p><p>“Equivalent—One Full Meal,” and hastily swal- </p><p>lowed them. </p><p> Refreshed and invigorated by the nourishment</p><p>so seriously needed, he proceeded to quick, effective </p><p>action. </p><p> Pressing a button in his desk marked: “P.T.”, an</p><p>apparently ornamental filigree upon the ceiling </p><p>dropped and snapped into the form of a suspended </p><p>package transporter. Pushing a button on the re- </p><p>ceiver of the transporter numbered: “7826,” a book, </p><p>stamped with that number, promptly slid into his </p><p>hand. The book proved to be a Laird and Lee’s </p><p>“Common School Edition” of “ Webster’s New </p><p>Standard Dictionary” of the copyright date of </p><p>“1912.” He had chosen this as his and Esmeralda's </p><p>private code-book, because he believed that the two </p><p>copies possessed by them were all that remained in </p><p>existence. </p><p> Slipping the book into his "Lightning Code-de-</p><p>cipherer,” he touched the numbered keys of its key- </p><p>board in the numerical combination given him by </p><p>Esmeralda in her message, and the delicate wire </p><p>arms quickly turned the pages and picked out for </p><p>him the words: “Parker,” “pass,” “mount,” and </p><p>“McKinley.” Remembering the “tiger” she had </p><p>spoken of, he was puzzled for a moment by the </p><p>manifest absurdity of looking for such an animal </p><p>in the eternal snows of the Alaskan mountains!— </p><p>and then he thought of the “Electro-visional” dial. </p><p> Turning to a globe contained in a complicated</p><p>mechanism behind him, he picked two fine needle- </p><p>points out of a holder, pressed one through its gela- </p><p>tine surface at “Mt. McKinley” and the other into </p><p>“New York City.” Giving the globe a single revo- </p><p>lution, the indicator of the “Lightning Air-iine Dis-</p><p>tance Calculator” promptly registered “3668 miles, </p><p>264 feet, 00 inches.” Throwing the clutch of his </p><p>“Electro-visional” into the “3670 mile” circuit, he </p><p>picked out, with the aid of his microscope, the faint </p><p>outline of the twin heads of “Denali and his Wife” </p><p>barely within the “W.N.W.” sector of the white </p><p>circle that appeared on the dial. Inserting a needle- </p><p>point barely beyond and to the left of the higher </p><p>of the two mountain peaks, he took a delicate copper </p><p>wire and connected this with “Local.” Throwing </p><p>the clutch back into “Local,” the faint outline of </p><p>the mountain disappeared, and a vivid picture of </p><p>“Parker Pass” replaced it. But, even with his </p><p>microscope, he could find nothing of his Esmeralda! </p><p>Finally, in the lower end, he picked out a faint </p><p>blurr of fine lines—flashing, disappearing, and </p><p>flashing again—and, remembering that she had her </p><p>“Electric Spark-screen Broadcaster” working at </p><p>the time of her mishap, he reasoned that the thing </p><p>was probably operating even yet, and that, there- </p><p>fore, he had at last definitely located his beloved. </p><p>FOR a moment the incongruous “tiger” tor- </p><p>mented him, but he figured that she, in her evi- </p><p>dent excitement, had probably distorted or incor- </p><p>rectly expressed a glimpse at a mountain goat, or </p><p>something of that sort. </p><p> Having successfully solved the problem of his</p><p>Esmeralda’s whereabouts, his next move was to ap- </p><p>ply to the “National Aerial-control Bureau” in </p><p>Washington for a special permit, with “right-of- </p><p>way,” for an “Electric-flash” transit to Mt. Mc- </p><p>Kinley, Alaska, between the 20,000 and 22,000 feet </p><p>ELECTRO-EPISODED IN A.D. 2025 </p><p>473 </p><p>strata, with return privilege “under his own </p><p>power,” starting "three minutes from moment of </p><p>application.” He also demanded photographed </p><p>copies of permit and necessary orders. </p><p> "Permit, etc., scarcely needed at that altitude,</p><p>especially as only one other ‘Electric-flash’ machine </p><p>yet in existence; and that—,” the clerk attempted </p><p>to expostulate. </p><p> But Algernon peremptorily shut off the sluggish</p><p>clerk’s remonstrances. </p><p> “Cut advice-stunt about what I need,” he broke</p><p>in, “and get busy with what I want, or I’ll call the </p><p>chief. Do you realize whom you are dealing with? </p><p>Now get busy, and SNAP TO IT!” </p><p> And, seeing in his “Electro-visional” that the</p><p>magic of his name had produced instant “snapping- </p><p>to-it” activities on the part of the clerk, he con- </p><p>nected up his “Radio Electro-photographing” cam- </p><p>era, and turned his attention to the last necessary </p><p>detail to be arranged before his departure. </p><p> Slipping the plug of his “Radiophone” into the</p><p>“E.V.R.” wavelength socket, he snapped the frame- </p><p>work of its head-phone and microphone combina- </p><p>tion over his face, and called softly: “Charlie Grant </p><p>there?” </p><p> “Yep! This is Charlie speaking,” his broker’s</p><p>voice replied, with terse economy of words. </p><p> Recognizing the voice, Algernon’s next question</p><p>was to the point. </p><p> “Anything doing on ’change?” he asked.</p><p> “Quiet as a ‘chink’ funeral now—just over flur-</p><p>ry,” his broker answered. "Two weeks ago rumor </p><p>broadcast President sore about inefficiency of old </p><p>Jim Macdonald—chief ‘National Law-enforcement </p><p>Bureau’—and ‘National Bootlegger Consolidated’ </p><p>dropped ten points. Two days later Jim resigned, </p><p>and N.B.C. lost twenty points. Next day President </p><p>appointed Wheeler Wayne (who has never taken a </p><p>drink in his life, where anybody could catch him </p><p>at it), and ‘N.B.C.’ hit the skids for fifty points. </p><p>Wayne’s first move was to order your local boot- </p><p>legger, Lippincott, raided and jailed, and the bot- </p><p>tom fell clear out of ‘N.B.C.’ For nearly a whole </p><p>day the Pit was stormed by a mob of the faint- </p><p>hearted in a panic, begging anybody and everybody </p><p>to take their ‘Bootlegger’ stock off their hands for</p><p>anything they would give. I had inside tip that </p><p>officers only found one quart in Lippincott’s pos- </p><p>session, so I did the charitable act (in your name) </p><p>by relieving them of ten millions. Would have </p><p>plunged deeper but afraid of complicating other </p><p>deals. Two days later old Jim Macdonald and Bill </p><p>Jenkins (head National Bootlegger Trust) settled </p><p>squabble about Jim’s demand for more dough; and </p><p>the ‘evidence’ against Lippincott’ was ‘lost,’ he was </p><p>turned loose, and ‘N.B.C.’ floated back to normal. </p><p>With care can unload and clean up about two mil- </p><p>lions, or can hang on—just as you say.” </p><p> Turning to one side Algernon slipped a sheet of</p><p>paper into, and switched the connection into what </p><p>looked like a complicated development of the orig- </p><p>inal typewriter; and then replied to his broker. </p><p> “You did fine, Charlie,” he said. “Don’t forget</p><p>that you double your regular percentage when I am </p><p>‘off the reservation’.” Then, after a momentary </p><p>hesitation to consider, he continued: “Tell book- </p><p>keeper to read statement into private radiophone at </p><p>once, as I already have ‘Radioelectrodictaphonolypo- </p><p>graph’ connected. Unload ‘Bootlegger’ stock as </p><p>soon as you can without sacrificing profits that you </p><p>are sure of, as I don’t want my name publicly mixed </p><p>in the business. And now listen, Charlie! I’m go- </p><p>ing away for a bit—probably for only a day or so, </p><p>if nothing unforeseen happens. If you want me, </p><p>call on regular ‘E.V.R.,’ but use ‘long distance.’ </p><p>If you think it best to look for me, come over here </p><p>and use my ‘Electro-visional.’ Will probably be in </p><p>neighborhood of Mt. McKinley in 3670-mile circuit </p><p>and‘W.N.W.’sector. Good-bye!” </p><p>AS Algernon ceased speaking, the silvery “ting” </p><p>of a little bell on his “Radio Electro-photo- </p><p>graphing” camera notified him of the receipt of the </p><p>photographed copies of his government permit and </p><p>the correlating orders issued; while the discontinu- </p><p>ance of the rapid “tick-tick” of his “Radioelectro- </p><p>dictaphonotypograph” told him that his broker’s </p><p>bookkeeper had completed his statement. From the </p><p>former he extracted two slips of paper, and found </p><p>them correct. But he studied the sheet of paper </p><p>that he took from the latter for a moment, in a </p><p>perplexed confusion at the phonetic simplicity of </p><p>the spelling of the words. Then, reflecting that </p><p>this mathematically-exact translation of oral sound </p><p>would eventually assist in the elimination of the </p><p>orthographic absurdities which always had bur- </p><p>dened a language that is too complex at its best, </p><p>he shoved this into an inside pocket along with the </p><p>other two; and, pressing a button in the side-wall </p><p>which opened a small door leading into a "one- </p><p>person” sized compartment in a perpendicular</p><p>pneumatic tube, he stepped within, and was shot </p><p>to the roof. </p><p> Going to the largest of the hangars that dotted</p><p>the roof, he pushed a button—and the door flew </p><p>open, and a glistening “Electro re-tempered” copper </p><p>monstrosity trundled out on a truck. The best that </p><p>could be said for its shape was that it looked like </p><p>a gigantic beer bottle. Stepping to the mouth of </p><p>the “bottle,” he pressed a button, and the stopper </p><p>flew out with a loud report. Entering the narrow </p><p>passage-way through the “neck,” he switched on </p><p>the electric lights and found himself in a spacious, </p><p>tempered-glass compartment “blown-into” the </p><p>framework in such a way as to practically surround </p><p>itself with a vacuum space, and with the few nec- </p><p>essary contacts elaborately insulated. A yank at a </p><p>lever started an “Oxygen Supply” apparatus (al- </p><p>ready set at "One Person”) going, and a touched </p><p>button caused the “stopper” to fly back into place </p><p>with another loud report. </p><p> From a mahogany wardrobe he took a bear-skin</p><p>fur suit which was lined with finely-woven copper- </p><p>wire cloth. Stepping into this, he set the "Interior </p><p>Heat Regulator” at 65° Fahrenheit, adjusted the </p><p>connection with the concealed storage battery, and </p><p>pushed the spring which caused the suit to “snap- </p><p>to” and fasten. </p><p> A shifted lever on a large keyboard set the “In-</p><p>terior Temperature Regulator” of the compartment </p><p>going at a “65°” adjustment, another started the </p><p>“Electro-visional,” a third connected a small </p><p>dynamo with the “Atomic-energy Reservoir” and </p><p>started it supplying the comparatively trifling elec- </p><p>trical needs, a fourth completed a similar direct </p><p>connection with the rest of the mechanism and a </p><p>474 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>fifth released an electron of atomic-energy from </p><p>the basic atom into the "Atomic-energy Reservoir” </p><p>to maintain the parity of the supply. </p><p> Seating himself in an upholstered chair, he pre-</p><p>pared for quick and decisive action. With one hand </p><p>he pulled down the “Helicopter” lever, and, through </p><p>the “Electro-visional,” saw a huge, “Electro re- </p><p>tempered” steel solid corkscrew-like device with a </p><p>“screw” fifty feet deep in the groove, shoot into </p><p>the air. Setting its regulator at “Half-speed,” he </p><p>touched a button and began to ascend slowly. </p><p>When the “Altitude Indicator” registered “1000 </p><p>Feet,” he turned "full speed" into the helicopter- </p><p>device and finished with a rush. At "20,000 Feet” </p><p>he shut the helicopter down to “Maintenance of </p><p>Altitude” speed, pulled a lever which released a </p><p>huge propeller from its underneath pocket, and set </p><p>it going at full speed “In Reverse," yanked the lever </p><p>back at “21,500 Feet,” and came to a full stop at </p><p>“22,000 Feet” with the underneath propeller roar- </p><p>ing noisily but harmlessly in its enclosed pocket. </p><p> Turning to the “Electro-visional” dial, he threw</p><p>the clutch into the “3670 Mile” circuit, picked out </p><p>the faint outline of the higher peak of Mt. McKin- </p><p>ley, and stuck a needle-point into it. This he con- </p><p>nected, by means of a delicate copper wire, with </p><p>“Local”—which he knew was permanently con- </p><p>nected in a similar manner with the gigantic </p><p>dynamo at Niagara Falls—set the regulator of his </p><p>“Electric-flash” at “.017 Seconds,” pushed a button </p><p>which shut off the helicopter, yanked back the lever </p><p>which collapsed it into its overhead pocket; and, as </p><p>he heard the heavy copper plates bang shut over </p><p>all, he closed his eyes and touched the final button. </p><p> Then, in spite of all precautions, he was nearly</p><p>blinded by the vivid lightning that enveloped the </p><p>entire machine; and, notwithstanding the intricate </p><p>system of "Shock Absorbers,” he thought for a </p><p>moment that he had been yanked in two as he was </p><p>shot through space at the rate of 186,000 miles per </p><p>second. And then, as if it was a reflex of the orig- </p><p>inal yank, came the answering “tug” of the rear </p><p>propeller as it automatically shot out of its pocket </p><p>going full speed “In Reverse.” </p><p> Opening his eyes with nerves taut for the crucial</p><p>moment, he reached for the “Plane-wing” lever </p><p>with one hand, and glanced at the “Speedometer” </p><p>for the indication of the moment when it would </p><p>be safe, and necessary, that he throw-out his bi- </p><p>plane-wings of “Electro re-tempered” steel with a </p><p>"spread” of one hundred and fifty feet.</p><p> Then, suddenly, the dual peaks of Mt. McKinley</p><p>appeared directly in front of his “Electro-visional”; </p><p>and, throwing caution to the winds, he yanked-down </p><p>the “Plane-wing” lever, and heard the rattle and </p><p>bang of the adjustments, and saw that the appa- </p><p>ratus was withstanding a severer test than it was </p><p>guaranteed for. </p><p> And then, even as he looked, the higher peak of</p><p>the mountain appeared directly underneath; and, </p><p>with instinctive recklessness, he gave the “Steer- </p><p>ing-lever” a yank which turned the machine “on-its’ </p><p>tail” at a sharp right-angle—missing a spill by a </p><p>fraction of a hair—jerked another lever which </p><p>tipped it into a practically-perpendicular “nose- </p><p>dive,” snapped that lerer back again and righted </p><p>himself, shoved-down the helioopter lever and </p><p>touched the button which shot that corkscrew-like </p><p>device aloft going at "Maintenance-of-Altitude” </p><p>speed, yanked back the lever of the rear propeller </p><p>which brought that instrument rattling back into </p><p>its pocket where it roared in a harmless fury—and, </p><p>with a jolt, came to a full stop; while beads of </p><p>perspiration broke out on his forehead at his nar- </p><p>row escape, though a triumphant smile played about </p><p>his lips as he thought of the sensation he would </p><p>create in the next “Aerial Olympic,” and his brain </p><p>registered the mental note for future reference </p><p>that it was his rear propeller going full speed “in </p><p>reverse," that had held him and saved a spill on </p><p>that acute, right-angle turn. </p><p>A GLANCE at his “Electro-visional” showed </p><p>that he was parallel with, and but a few feet </p><p>away from, the top of the cliff above Parker Pass; </p><p>and the first thing he saw was Esmeralda’s biplane </p><p>with its nose buried in a cake of ice. But its </p><p>"Spark-screen Broadcaster” was humming merrily, </p><p>and its rear “spot-light” revealed the details below, </p><p>behind the "screen,” in vivid detail. </p><p> Directly below the wrecked biplane, he quickly</p><p>discovered his beloved Esmeralda standing waist- </p><p>deep in the snow, with one arm raised as if to </p><p>repel an expected attack, and still clad in the “pic- </p><p>ture-frame” costume which had caused their row. </p><p>A glimpse at his "Exterior Temperature” indicator </p><p>which registered "60° below zero,” caused a fleet- </p><p>ing fear of dire results from her bare-skinned ex- </p><p>posure ; but a reflection on the proven ability of the </p><p>“female of the species” for facing wintry blasts in </p><p>scanty attire, quickly chased his fears away, and </p><p>he turned his attention to the direction indicated by </p><p>her upraised, protesting arm. </p><p> And then—TO AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY,</p><p>HE DISCOVERED THE FIGURE OF A MON- </p><p>STROUS ROYAL BENGAL TIGER ON THE </p><p>LEDGE ABOVE HER, WHICH WAS POISED IN </p><p>THE ATTITUDE FOR ITS FINAL, FATAL </p><p>SPRING UPON ITS PREY! </p><p> With frantic energy he “yanked-down” the</p><p>"Landing” lever of the helicopter, grabbed the </p><p>parachute, pushed the button which "unstoppered” </p><p>the “bottle,” and jumped—making the descent in </p><p>“record” time, but landing so violently that he was </p><p>buried in the snow, because, in his panic, he for- </p><p>got to pull the string of his parachute until he was </p><p>two-thirds down. </p><p> A momentary fear of being smothered in the</p><p>snow, was followed by a spasm of skilled “football” </p><p>tactics in “bucking” and squirming his way out; </p><p>and, floundering frantically towards his beloved, he </p><p>yelled at the top of his voice: </p><p> “Esmeralda! My darling! I am here!”</p><p> With the stately grace of a real “blue-blooded”</p><p>aristocrat, the royal maiden turned majestically, </p><p>and froze the heart within him with a frigid glare </p><p>—such as only those with four centuries of un- </p><p>mixed “Mayflower” blood in their veins, can hope </p><p>to aspire to. </p><p> “Your presence is sufficiently perceptible,” she</p><p>said in measured tones, “to preclude any necessity </p><p>for such boisterous conduct. In the future, when </p><p>we are abroad together, it will please me greatly </p><p>if you bring your manners along with you, instead </p><p>of leaving them at home. Also, I would remind you </p><p>ELECTRO-EPISODED IN A.D. 2025 </p><p>475 </p><p>that you have been fifteen whole minutes in answer- </p><p>ing my ‘call’.” </p><p> And then Nature claimed its own, and, woman-</p><p>like, Esmeralda fell fainting into her lover’s arms, </p><p>murmuring as she lost consciousness: “Algy! My </p><p>darling! My savior!” </p><p> For a brief moment Algernon pressed the inani-</p><p>mate form of his sweetheart to his manly breast, </p><p>and showered a storm of passionate kisses upon a </p><p>wisp of her hair as it floated in the breeze against </p><p>his nose—and then he bethought him of that poised </p><p>tiger on the ledge above! </p><p> Quickly he pulled his “Electric Automatic,"</p><p>aimed carefully at the beast’s heart, and pressed </p><p>the button. A black spot showed on the spot he </p><p>had aimed at, and the air became filled with the </p><p>pungent odor of burned hair—but the brute above </p><p>remained in an apparently statuesque unconscious- </p><p>ness of the assault! </p><p> Nonplussed and dumfounded, Algernon pulled</p><p>out his collapsible opera glasses, adjusted them, and </p><p>studied the perplexing phenomenon closely. Then </p><p>at last q ray of light penetrated his brain as the </p><p>memory of a forgotten incident recurred to him, </p><p>and he mentally connected this incident with the </p><p>enigma above. Realizing the simple truth at last, </p><p>he burst into uproarious laughter and yelled at the </p><p>top of his voice in unrestrained glee—until the dor- </p><p>mant echoes of the “Great Silent North” awakened </p><p>from their age-old slumbers, and an avalanche of </p><p>snow was loosened from its mooring on the opposite </p><p>mountain-side. </p><p> Algernon had remembered that, some six months</p><p>before, a Royal Bengal tiger had escaped from </p><p>“Barnum and Bailey’s” circus, while it was show- </p><p>ing at Des Moines, Iowa; and that the efforts to re- </p><p>capture it, had only resulted in driving it into the </p><p>northern wilderness. This, then, was that tiger! </p><p>Happening in the neighborhood and naturally in a </p><p>famished condition, a scent of Esmeralda had </p><p>reached it and had aroused its savage instincts. </p><p>But, as it stole out onto the ledge for the final, fatal </p><p>spring, being unused to northern temperatures, the </p><p>60° below zero gale had frozen it dead in its tracks! </p><p> And then, just as all his troubles and worries</p><p>seemed to have vanished, the “whir” of an airplane </p><p>engine turned his eyes upwards; and, directly over- </p><p>head, he saw a “Purity League” biplane circling </p><p>for a landing.</p><p> With frantic energy he shook the unconscious</p><p>form that reposed in his arms, and shouted into her </p><p>ear at the top of his voice: </p><p> "Esmeralda! Darling! Wake up! That‘Purity</p><p>League’ sleuth has found us! He is sure to be one </p><p>of those ‘ex-convict’ crooks working on a percentage </p><p>for what he can get, and, if he catches you out here </p><p>in public in that costume, he will rush you into one </p><p>of his ‘kangaroo’ courts, and ‘railroad’ you into </p><p>jail! Wake up! Es-” </p><p>THE sharp angle of Mary Jane’s bony knee-cap, </p><p>adeptly from practice and forcibly by instinct, </p><p>projected into my left-hand lower short-ribs, finally </p><p>aroused me; and, as if it were an echo of my dream, </p><p>I distinctly heard the dulcet tones of her gentle </p><p>voice in my ear, shouting: </p><p> “Wake up you, John Henry! You’re snoring like</p><p>a horse! Haven’t I told you times enough never to </p><p>sleep on your back? Turn over on your right side! </p><p>And you’ve been talking something awful in your </p><p>sleep, too! Who’s this ‘darling Esmeralda,’ any- </p><p>way? If I catch her monkeying with you, I’ll </p><p>scratch her eyes out! None of your lies, now! </p><p>There wasn’t any ‘Esmeralda’ in that pictureplay </p><p>we saw tonight, so you better not try to spring </p><p>anything of that sort on me! Why don’t you-” </p><p> But, peeved by my rude awakening, and not feel-</p><p>ing well anyway, I stopped the verbal torrent by </p><p>breaking in. </p><p> “If you can’t be satisfied with nagging at me</p><p>about nothing all day, but you must go waking me </p><p>up in the middle of the night to keep it up, I’ll </p><p>move into the spare room, and let you sleep by </p><p>yourself,” I threatened. “Besides,” I added, “you’ve </p><p>got me crowded clear off onto the bedrail, and no- </p><p>body could sleep like that, anyway.” </p><p> Mary Jane, my wife, was contrite and very hum-</p><p>ble at once, which shows that I know how to man- </p><p>age her properly when I really want to. </p><p> “I didn’t wake you up to nag at you, John,” she</p><p>said penitently, as she snuggled up to me and </p><p>reached out her hand to caress me. “But that stuff </p><p>of yours down in the cellar has been popping-off </p><p>to beat the band for an hour, and I just know that </p><p>you’ll lose the whole batch if you don’t tend to it </p><p>right away. I told you that you were bottling it </p><p>too soon, but it never does any good for me to say </p><p>anything. You’ll just-” </p><p> “Well, if it’s going to ‘pop,’ it’s going to and</p><p>that’s all there is to it," I broke in petulantly. “If </p><p>you think you know so much more about it than </p><p>I do, you can just make the next batch yourself and </p><p>see if you can do any better. Now move over and </p><p>give me enough of the bed to lie comfortably in, </p><p>and give me a chance to get a little sleep.” </p><p> And, as my “better-half” squirmed back to her</p><p>own side of the bed, I turned over upon my right </p><p>aide and slept fairly well for the rest of the night. </p><p>The End, </p><p>2he ULTRA-ELIXIR of YOUTH </p><p>Hij A.

In many lands and in many </p><p>ways men have devoted their lives to </p><p>endeavoring to make this dream of perpetual youth </p><p>a reality. They have concocted weird mixtures or </p><p>elixirs, they have wrought spells and practiced </p><p>magic, they have searched in strange lands for a </p><p>fabulous life-giving fountain, and they have been </p><p>jeered at, ridiculed, scoffed at for their pains. Hence </p><p>it will come as a most amazing surprise to the world </p><p>to learn that one man actually accomplished his </p><p>purpose, and discovered the secret which had so </p><p>eagerly and vainly been sought for during count- </p><p>less centuries. Moreover, his discovery was made </p><p>recently—within the past three years in fact, while </p><p>more astonishing yet, the secret has been forever </p><p>lost to the world. </p><p> Now that the man responsible for the results can</p><p>never repeat his performance, and has left no de- </p><p>tailed explanation of the means whereby the con- </p><p>ditions were brought about, there is no reason why </p><p>an account of the whole matter should not be pub- </p><p>lished. </p><p> Undoubtedly many of my readers will recollect</p><p>the excitement caused by the inexplicable disap- </p><p>pearance of Doctor Elias Henderson, the well known </p><p>and prominent biologist of McCracken College. </p><p>Probably, too, it will also be remembered that, al- </p><p>most coincidentally with his disappearance, a num- </p><p>ber of the University students vanished, as well as </p><p>two private citizens and a physician. </p><p> As a great many more or less conflicting accounts</p><p>were published in the newspapers o' 'he time, and </p><p>as many of these were far from accurate, it may be </p><p>well to give a brief resumg of the events, for, </p><p>strange as it may seem, </p><p>the disappearance, which </p><p>for a time supplied head- </p><p>line material for the </p><p>press, had a very direct </p><p>bearing upon the dis- </p><p>covery of perpetual youth, </p><p>or rather, I might say, </p><p>the discovery had a direct </p><p>bearing upon the disap- </p><p>pearances. </p><p> The facts in the case</p><p>were simple and were </p><p>well established. Five</p><p>students, two private citizens, an instructor </p><p>and a female doctor, together with Doctor Hen- </p><p>derson, completely vanished without any ap- </p><p>parent or determinable reason. The investigations </p><p>which followed, and which oddly enough were only </p><p>instituted after the disappearance of Doctor Hen- </p><p>derson, revealed the fact that the ten missing per- </p><p>sons had been absent from their accustomed haunts </p><p>for some days before they had been missed. It was </p><p>also established that all had been very friendly and </p><p>that they had frequently met, apparently in secret, </p><p>and that the other nine had made periodical visits </p><p>to Dr. Henderson’s laboratory. This, however, was </p><p>not strange, as it was well known that all, with the </p><p>exception of the two citizens—one a merchant and </p><p>the other a banker—had been taking courses in biol- </p><p>ogy from Dr. Henderson. It was therefore assumed </p><p>that the meetings referred to were in the nature of </p><p>purely scientific affairs, although why the unscien- </p><p>tific merchant and banker should have been present, </p><p>or should have visited Dr. Henderson’s laboratory, </p><p>was a mystery. </p><p> Had Dr. Henderson not vanished, it is highly</p><p>probable that he would have been suspected of mak- </p><p>ing away with the others, but as he, too, had dis- </p><p>appeared, any such theory was of course discarded. </p><p>It was also determined that not one of the ten had </p><p>any apparent reason for vanishing; not one was in </p><p>debt or involved in any scandal, and no one could </p><p>advance any reasonable theory for any person wish- </p><p>ing to murder them, for with the exception of the </p><p>banker and merchant, all were persons of very mod- </p><p>erate means, while the banker and merchant were </p><p>known never to carry large sums of money on their </p><p>persons, but conducted practically all of their busi- </p><p>ness by means of checks. </p><p>FINALLY, and making the case even more baf- </p><p>fling, the garments of all the ten were found </p><p>intact though carelessly tossed aside. The students’ </p><p>clothes were found in their several rooms, the gar- </p><p>ments of the merchant and banker were discovered </p><p>in their private offices, the lady physician’s gar- </p><p>ments were in her office, and Doctor Henderson’s </p><p>street clothes were found in a corner of his labora- </p><p>tory. No one who was questioned, and hundreds of </p><p>persons were examined, could definitely swear as to </p><p>when they had last seen the missing persons, and not </p><p>one witness could be located who was positive as to </p><p>the last person seen with any of the missing people. </p><p>Doctor Henderson was a rather retiring, secretive </p><p>man, and frequently slept on a cot in his laboratory, </p><p>and as no one really knew when he had vanished, no </p><p>one could remember hav- </p><p>ing seen any stranger or</p><p>other person with him </p><p>when he was last seen. </p><p>The janitor of the build- </p><p>ing, after striving his </p><p>best to revisualize the </p><p>events of the past few </p><p>weeks, stated that he was </p><p>under the impression that </p><p>he had seen a young man </p><p>— a youth of fifteen or </p><p>thereabouts, entering and </p><p>leaving the doctor’s </p><p>laboratory on several occasions, but he could </p><p>not be sure whether or not he had ever seen </p><p>the scientist in the young fellow’s company. The </p><p>servant at the home of Dr. Elvira Flagg, also </p><p>was hazy in her memory, although she, too, </p><p>declared that she had noticed a young man, and </p><p>a girl of about the same age, who frequently entered </p><p>and left the office; but whether in company with Dr. </p><p>Flagg she was not sure. As the office boys of both </p><p>the merchant and banker also remembered seeing a </p><p>youth make frequent visits to their employers the </p><p>police at once began a search for a stripling an- </p><p>swering the rather vague descriptions of the several </p><p>witnesses. No trace of such a person could be </p><p>found, but, to their surprise and confusion, the gar- </p><p>ments of such a young fellow were found in a closet </p><p> JLfODERN science is deeply immersed in experiments</p><p> to bring forlli the Elixir of Youth.

Nothing further was discovered, and the </p><p>entire affair was given up as an unsolvable mystery. </p><p>During the investigation however, evidences were </p><p>discovered which tended to show that several other </p><p>and hitherto unsuspected crimes had been committed </p><p>by the missing parties. Just what these were, the </p><p>authorities have never disclosed, but according to </p><p>persistent rumor they were in the nature of infan- </p><p>tile crimes. Gossip had it that persons had been </p><p>questioned who insisted that they had heard the </p><p>cries of infants issuing from Dr. Henderson’s lab- </p><p>oratory, that no children had ever come forth, and </p><p>that it was their belief that the scientist and his </p><p>friends had sacrificed the infants in some experi- </p><p>ments or had actually subjected them to vivisection. </p><p>Hence, in the minds of many persons, the missing </p><p>ten had had good reason to disappear, being, so </p><p>these worthies argued, fugitives from justice and </p><p>from the wrath of the public. Indeed, ru&amp;or and </p><p>gossip soon linked the names of the ten as members </p><p>of some secret and horrible cult with human sacri- </p><p>fices and what not. And the action of the police in </p><p>hushing up the matter and abandoning all efforts </p><p>to solve the mystery, only confirmed these ugly ru- </p><p>mors in the minds of many. </p><p> But like all other mysteries and scandals, the</p><p>matter soon lost interest, and within a twelvemonth </p><p>was practically forgotten. Thus matters stood when </p><p>I received a letter from the regents of McCracken </p><p>College in which I was offered the position of Pro- </p><p>fessor of Biology left vacant by the disappearance </p><p>of Dr. Henderson. </p><p> Ordinarily, I think, I would have declined, for I</p><p>had an excellent position, and while the salary at </p><p>McCracken was larger than that which I was re- </p><p>ceiving, yet it did not offer the scope_ in research </p><p>work which I desired, and as I had a" fairly good </p><p>income of my own, the salary was not so important. </p><p>But remembering the mystery which had surround- </p><p>ed the former biologist’s disappearance, and having </p><p>been well acquainted with Dr. Henderson when we </p><p>were students together at Belmore, the offer some- </p><p>how appealed to me, because for some inexplicable </p><p>reason, I had a feeling that I might be able to solve </p><p>the mystery. </p><p> I therefore accepted the position, and, a few</p><p>weeks later, found myself in possession of Dr. Hen- </p><p>derson’s laboratory, instruments, notes and appar- </p><p>atus. I had in fact almost literally stepped into his </p><p>shoes. I am not superstitious and am not nervous,</p><p>and I have never been subject to hallucinations or </p><p>to any sensations for which I cannot account upon </p><p>scientific or medical grounds. But from the moment </p><p>when I took charge of Dr. Henderson’s work and </p><p>laboratory I had the strange and wholly unaccount- </p><p>able feeling of being in the presence of others, of </p><p>being constantly watched. At times this sensation </p><p>became almost unbearable. Several times I found </p><p>myself involuntarily stepping aside as if to avoid </p><p>stepping upon or bumping into someone, although </p><p>the room was empty, and once or twice I actually </p><p>started and shivered as I seemed to feel hands </p><p>touching my limbs or body. It was, of course, ridic- </p><p>ulous. I was no believer in ghosts or spirits, and </p><p>I decided that it was merely a psychological matter, </p><p>a reaction of my nervous system to the atmosphere </p><p>of mystery which pervaded the place. Hence, 1 </p><p>laughed at my own sensations, called upon my su- </p><p>perior mentality to govern my subjective nerves, </p><p>and proceeded with my work, but throughout my </p><p>stay in the laboratory—which was, I must confess, </p><p>of short duration—I never overcame the decidedly </p><p>uncomfortable feelings which I have mentioned. </p><p> My first act upon taking possession of Dr. Hen-</p><p>derson’s apparatus and laboratory was to combine </p><p>a thorough search of the premises with an equally </p><p>thorough housecleaning. Dr. Henderson, like so </p><p>many scientific men, was unfortunately far from </p><p>orderly or neat. Instruments, books, papers, appar- </p><p>atus, formute and chemicals had been left in dis- </p><p>array, evidently having been left wherever the biol- </p><p>ogist had used them last; drawers and cupboards </p><p>were piled full of a hodge-podge of odds and ends; </p><p>soiled laboratory aprons; old shoes and dirty towels </p><p>were tucked away here and there, and as I cleared </p><p>up the place I wondered how the police could have </p><p>made a thorough search of the room under the ex- </p><p>isting conditions. And it was soon evident that they </p><p>had not. Among a pile of old magazines, discarded </p><p>litmus paper, and other rubbish in a closet I came </p><p>upon a find which, temporarily at least, completely </p><p>knocked me out. This was in fact a bundle of in- </p><p>fant’s garments, rather mussed and soiled and evi- </p><p>dently worn. For a space I sat, gazing at the tiny </p><p>garments with a strange mingling of horror, dis- </p><p>may, amazement and wonder. Had the ugly rumors </p><p>been true after all? Had my old classmate gone </p><p>mad with his researches and had he actually sacri- </p><p>ficed an innocent child on the altar of science? If </p><p>not why should he have been in possession of these </p><p>garments? Where were the remains of the child </p><p>itself? And what had been his relations with the </p><p>others who had vanished? What terrible things </p><p>had occurred to cause them all to disappear? Surely, </p><p>I thought, no matter what events had led up to the </p><p>culminating destruction the child, Dr. Hender-</p><p>son must have made notes of it somewhere. What- </p><p>ever he had done had beyond doubt been done in a </p><p>mistaken, a warped idea that it was in the cause of </p><p>science; that the means would be justified by the </p><p>end; and hence he would have been certain to have </p><p>recorded his theories, or the results of his experi- </p><p>ments. To solve the mystery I must find such notes, </p><p>and, abandoning all other work, I sought diligently </p><p>and feverishly for some note book, some pad or even </p><p>some scrap of paper which might explain every- </p><p>thing. </p><p> Of course, I realized, there was a possibility, even</p><p>a strong chance that he had destroyed the notes or </p><p>had taken them with him. The very fact that he </p><p>had disappeared, together with the others who I no </p><p>longer doubted had been implicated with him in the </p><p>crime, proved that they realized the enormity of </p><p>their deeds and hence would have destroyed any evi- </p><p>dence or records. But the fact that the garments </p><p>had been left so carelessly about caused me to think </p><p>that more conclusive proofs might also have been </p><p>overlooked. Moreover, Dr. Henderson, as I had </p><p>discovered already, was extremely absent-minded in </p><p>ordinary matters, and he also had had a habit of </p><p>jotting down notes on anything and everything that </p><p>came to hand. Hence, I reasoned, even if he or the </p><p>THE ULTRA-ELIXIR OF YOUTH </p><p>479 </p><p>others had made away with the most important evi- </p><p>dences, there was more than an even chance that </p><p>they had overlooked or had completely forgotten </p><p>stray notes which would throw light on the matter. </p><p> It was slow work, studying the almost hierogly-</p><p>phic-like writing of my predecessor and examining </p><p>every scrap of paper, even the margins of leaves in </p><p>books and pamphlets, for what I sought. And for </p><p>hours my efforts were fruitless. At last, when I </p><p>had almost abandoned hope, I opened a small drawer </p><p>in a littered and dust-covered desk and made a sec- </p><p>ond and most surprising discovery. The drawer was </p><p>filled with the strangest collection of objects which </p><p>could possibly be imagined in the laboratory of a </p><p>scientist. There were infants’ garments, bottles of </p><p>prepared foods, a nursing bottle, safety pins, a </p><p>rattle, various other objects requisite to the well- </p><p>fare of small children, and, what seemed to me most </p><p>important of all, a square, rather thick book which, </p><p>immediately I opened it I discovered was a diary. </p><p>Here, if anywhere, I felt, lay the solution of the </p><p>mysteries. The first entry was dated over three </p><p>years back, but a short perusal of the pages proved </p><p>that the diary had not been kept regularly or con- </p><p>secutively, and that for long periods, no dates had </p><p>been entered. It was, in fact, more of a journal or </p><p>note book than a diary, and almost feverishly I </p><p>turned the pages, glancing only at the occasional </p><p>dates, and to my delight found that the last dated </p><p>entry was September 14th, of the current year, </p><p>only a few days before the disappearance of Dr. </p><p>Henderson had been made known. Beyond ques- </p><p>tion, then, there would be references to the myste- </p><p>rious events, and turning back the pages, I set my- </p><p>self to the task of reading the vojume page by page. </p><p>AND as I did so I became more and more as- </p><p>tounded at what I found, for the indisputable </p><p>evidence of Dr. Henderson’s writing proved that </p><p>the vanished biologist, whose whole life had been </p><p>devoted to science and proven facts, had believed in </p><p>the wholly unscientific and preposterous dream of </p><p>perpetual youth. </p><p> “I see no scientific reason why organic matter</p><p>should deteriorate with age,” he had written in one </p><p>entry. “Age, in animals or plants, is merely the </p><p>decay of certain tissues or cells brought about by </p><p>various causes, most of which are unnatural, arti- </p><p>ficial or due to the abuse of nature’s laws. I have </p><p>talked with E. on the subject, and she agrees with </p><p>me. If we admit Einstein’s theory of relativity </p><p>then age is merely relative—in the universal scheme </p><p>of things the infant is as old as the senile centenar-</p><p>ian or vice-versa. Biologically there is no such </p><p>thing as old age. Growth, yes; the building up of </p><p>tissues by cells, yes; but the healthy, normal cell of </p><p>the aged plant or animal is indistinguishable from </p><p>the corresponding cell of the new-born infant or the </p><p>seedling plant. Scientifically endless youth or the </p><p>arresting of cellular decay may be impossible, but </p><p>so many known facts refute scientific possibilities </p><p>that 1 am beginning to lose faith in scientific laws.” </p><p> A little later I came upon the following: “I have</p><p>cautiously sounded my class by dwelling lightly </p><p>upon the matter of arresting decay and producing </p><p>so-called perpetual youth. I judge several of the </p><p>young men were intensely interested as, after the </p><p>lecture, they remained and plied me with many ques- </p><p>tions. The subject opens up endless vistas. If the </p><p>breaking down of cellular tissues were possible, </p><p>death could be averted, except by accident, and prac- </p><p>tical immortality could be achieved. And what tre- </p><p>mendous accomplishments might be achieved by a </p><p>scientist, an artist, any intellectual man, if he was </p><p>assured of a virile, healthy existence for hundreds </p><p>of years; if for a century or more he retained the </p><p>energy, the brain power, the physical and organic </p><p>status of the prime of life. </p><p> “I believe this might be accomplished. E. (I had</p><p>already assumed that Dr. Elvira Flagg was the E. </p><p>referred to) is as greatly interested in the subject </p><p>as myself. In her practice she has opportunities to </p><p>study living beings in all stages of cellular decay or </p><p>age, and with physical and mental powers breaking </p><p>down through various causes. Her observations are </p><p>as valuable to me as are my biological experiments </p><p>to her. Several of my young men are also vastly </p><p>interested and we often discuss the matter together. </p><p>Perhaps the time has not yet arrived when man can </p><p>choose the age or physical state in which he elects </p><p>to remain, but some day it will be as ordinary an </p><p>affair as to select one’s food or method of convey- </p><p>ance.” </p><p> For several pages after this last entry Dr. Hen-</p><p>derson’s diary omitted all reference to the subject, </p><p>and I began to think that his observations had been </p><p>wholly theoretical, and that he had not seriously </p><p>considered the matter. But in this I was grossly </p><p>mistaken, for once again the subject was the sole </p><p>topic of the notes. </p><p> “I believe that we are on the way to solving the</p><p>problem of arresting the deterioration of organic </p><p>matter when caused by the lapse of time,” he had </p><p>written. “A regrettable accident has indicated the </p><p>path we should follow. Several weeks ago the huge </p><p>airship Colossus was destroyed by an explosion</p><p>when passing over the village of Emerson. One of </p><p>my young men who resides in the vicinity of Emer- </p><p>son mentioned a most curious and interesting phe- </p><p>nomenon which has occurred where the accident </p><p>took place. The health of the residents has greatly </p><p>improved; several of the aged inmates of the County </p><p>Home have recovered full use of their limbs and </p><p>eyesight, and some ancient and dying trees have </p><p>shown unusual and most astonishing growth—put- </p><p>ting out new shoots and fresh leaves. I have visited </p><p>Emerson in company with E. and have verified all </p><p>these statements. Vegetation is far more luxuriant </p><p>in the area about the village than elsewhere, and E. </p><p>personally interviewed and examined a number of </p><p>persons, and she assures me that there are indisput- </p><p>able proofs of marked rejuvenation. We believe that </p><p>the QW gas with which the airship was inflated was </p><p>the direct cause of these interesting phenomena. </p><p>As workers in the laboratory where this gas is man- </p><p>ufactured have exhibited no signs of similar effects, </p><p>we can only assume that the explosion, which has </p><p>so far been inexplicable, altered the gas in such a </p><p>way as to produce some chemical compound which </p><p>has the power to arrest the ravages of age and to </p><p>cause rejuvenation in organisms. Unfortunately </p><p>the composition of QW is a closely guarded secret, </p><p>and the gas is not available for experimental pur- </p><p>480 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>poses. Could we only obtain a small amount of the </p><p>gas we might make astounding discoveries.” </p><p> I was now as deeply interested in Dr. Henderson’s</p><p>records as he had been in his visionary dream of </p><p>perpetual youth. The destruction of the Colosstis </p><p>was still fresh in my mind; it had been a nation- </p><p>wide sensation, for the explosion, the cause of which </p><p>had never been found, had utterly destroyed the </p><p>entire crew of the immense craft. Neither could I </p><p>doubt the truth of Dr. Henderson’s statements re- </p><p>garding the conditions which had followed the dis- </p><p>aster. But, I reasoned, this might have been due </p><p>to perfectly normal and easily explained causes </p><p>which the biologist in his enthusiasm had overlook- </p><p>ed. Was it not quite possible that the gas, or the </p><p>compounds arising from its explosion, had acted as </p><p>a fertilizer and had thus caused a sudden spurt of </p><p>vegetable growth about Emerson? And was it not </p><p>equally possible, and even reasonable, to suppose </p><p>that the disaster, the excitement attendant upon it, </p><p>and the shock of the explosion had caused a nervous </p><p>exhilaration or had acted as a stimulant to the in- </p><p>habitants, especially to the aged members of the </p><p>community, which would, temporarily, give them </p><p>new vigor and a false rejuvenation? Yes, unques- </p><p>tionably such was the rase, for, I reasoned, had the </p><p>effects been lasting, had there been any marked and </p><p>unusual results from the explosion of the airship, </p><p>the press would most certainly have gotten hold of </p><p>it. </p><p>SUCH thoughts raced through my brain as I pe- </p><p>rused the succeeding pages of my predecessor’s </p><p>journal, until once again, I found myself fascinated </p><p>by the record. </p><p> “E. has solved one of the obstacles,” it began.</p><p>“Among her patients is a Mr. Burke, a wealthy mer- </p><p>chant who is under a deep obligation to her. She </p><p>has mentioned her desire to secure some QW gas </p><p>for an experiment of great medical and scientific </p><p>value and he has assured her that through political </p><p>friends he can secure some. If we obtain this I </p><p>shall endeavor to reproduce on a small scale such an </p><p>explosion as occurred at Emerson, subjecting aged </p><p>tissues to the resultant gases. The difficulty will </p><p>be to obtain the same effects. QW is theoretically </p><p>non-explosive, and I am now devoting all my spare </p><p>time to solving the problem of why the Colossus </p><p>exploded. In this work I have the invaluable assis- </p><p>tance of Montross, one of my students who has </p><p>shown unusual ability in chemical research work </p><p>and received his degree in that science last spring." </p><p> Evidently Dr. Henderson’s problems occupied far</p><p>too much of his time to permit him to make regular </p><p>entries, or else nothing important enough to tran- </p><p>scribe occurred, for the next entry in the journal </p><p>was dated nearly two weeks after the foregoing, </p><p>and, as was so often the case, made no reference to </p><p>what had occurred in the interim. </p><p> “There is now no doubt in our minds that so-</p><p>called age may be arrested,” he wrote. “My experi- </p><p>ment, 612A, has proved this. In a way, the explo- </p><p>sion was rather disastrous, for it destroyed much </p><p>valuable apparatus and quite seriously injured Mon- </p><p>tross. However, he is rapidly recovering and E. </p><p>declares that the amazing rapidity with which his </p><p>injured tissues are healing is due entirely to the </p><p>effects of the unknown chemicals released by the </p><p>breaking down of the QW gas. Evidently, too, the </p><p>effects of these are incredibly rapid, for despite the </p><p>fact that owing to the unexpected violence of the </p><p>explosion having destroyed the apparatus designed </p><p>to hold the resultant chemicals, the organisms I had </p><p>in readiness have shown truly remarkable signs of </p><p>rejuvenation. Indeed, E. and myself have felt the </p><p>effects. We both have more vigor, greater vital </p><p>force and greater clarity of thought than previously, </p><p>and yet there must have been a most minute quan- </p><p>tity of the chemicals produced by the explosion. </p><p>Montross declares that now we have solved the prob- </p><p>lem of breaking down QW we can unquestionably </p><p>produce the desired chemicals without resorting to </p><p>such a roundabout and dangerous method. </p><p> “It is a great pity that science is so hampered by</p><p>lack of funds. To secure the apparatus and chem- </p><p>icals required to carry on our experiments, and to </p><p>perfect them, it will be necessary to secure large </p><p>sums. Neither E., Montross nor myself possess suf- </p><p>ficient money, and to solicit funds from the univer- </p><p>sity or from others would be futile. We would be </p><p>scoffed at if we divulged the purpose for which we </p><p>require the money. I fear we will be forced to aban- </p><p>don further researches in this direction. What a </p><p>pity, when the results might be of such incalculable </p><p>benefit to mankind!” </p><p> Again there was a lapse, until under date of July</p><p>5th was the following: “Montrosshas paved the way </p><p>for carrying on the experiments. His uncle, a Mr. </p><p>Redfield, is a wealthy banker whose obsession has </p><p>been a fear of becoming a helpless, decrepit old man. </p><p>A few days ago he stated, in the presence of young </p><p>Montross, that he would give a million if he could </p><p>retain all his faculties until his death. This gave </p><p>Montross an idea, and at the risk of being jeered at, </p><p>he related what we had done and suggested that </p><p>Redfield should finance our experiments. To his de-</p><p>light his uncle was intensely interested and ex- </p><p>pressed his willingness to do so on the condition </p><p>that he might be a witness of our experiments. I </p><p>have agreed to this, as had E. Her friend, Burke, </p><p>has also been taken into our confidence, and five of </p><p>my students have been enlisted in the cause. We </p><p>have agreed that what we do must be kept to our- </p><p>selves until we meet with success or failure, and as </p><p>E. puts it, we have formed a little scientific secret </p><p>society. We have no desire to let others know what </p><p>we are doing or to let the press reporters get hold </p><p>of the matter. Hence we meet more or less secretly </p><p>or in my laboratory where we are safe from prying </p><p>eyes or listening ears. </p><p> "Montross is entirely recovered and is working</p><p>diligently at his chemical preparations. Burke, by </p><p>the way, has been of inestimable aid, for he has. </p><p>managed to secure the formula for QW. Political' </p><p>graft after all has its advantages.” </p><p> As I read on, I became more and more amazed,</p><p>more and more fascinated by the revelations of this </p><p>intimate journal of the missing biologist. Already </p><p>much which had been mysterious had been cleared </p><p>up. The bond which had linked Burke, the hard- </p><p>headed merchant and political boss, Redfield the </p><p>millionaire banker, Dr. Flagg the female physician, </p><p>Montross the instructor in chemistry, the five stu- </p><p>dents and Dr. Henderson, was explained. The rea- </p><p>THE ULTRA-ELIXIR OF YOUTH </p><p>481 </p><p>son for the meetings of the ten was clear and, be- </p><p>yond question, all had seen fit to vanish for the </p><p>same reason. I had little doubt now that even that </p><p>reason would be divulged as I read on, and forget- </p><p>ting time, work and all else, I devoured the contents </p><p>of the journal. But what I found exceeded my wild- </p><p>est dreams and fascinated, astounded, fairly trem- </p><p>bling with excitement, I read the wholly incredible, </p><p>yet indisputably true story of the most amazing </p><p>events ever transcribed by human hands; a story </p><p>which, omitting the dates and irrevelant entries, </p><p>ran as follows: </p><p> “Montross has succeeded. He has separated over</p><p>twenty hitherto unknown chemicals from the QW </p><p>gas. Among these is an entirely new element which </p><p>he has named Juvenum and which he believes holds </p><p>the key to our success. Even if we fail, the dis- </p><p>covery of this element will make him famous. Burke </p><p>and Redfield are fairly crazy over the work. The </p><p>latter has put his entire fortune at our disposal. E. </p><p>has been untiring, and as soon as our labors are </p><p>crowned with success or we are convinced of the </p><p>futility of further investigations I shall make her </p><p>my wife. If we succeed, the vista before us is too </p><p>marvelous to realize; endless years of perpetual </p><p>youth together; never to grow old, never to lose </p><p>the freshness and beauty of her full womanhood, </p><p>never to lose my vigor, my intellect, my enthusiasm! </p><p>But we have all agreed not to keep the knowledge </p><p>of our success from the world. We have argued </p><p>at length on this. Burke and Redfield were at first </p><p>all for retaining the secret. Burke saw a marvelous </p><p>money-making opportunity in it, treating persons </p><p>for fabulous sums—millionaires he stated would pay </p><p>anything to retain their youth, while Redfield ar- </p><p>gued that if no one grew old the world would soon </p><p>be overcrowded and dire results would follow. E., </p><p>h*wever, pointed out that even if we could prevent </p><p>the ravages of time we might not and probably </p><p>would not be able to prevent the ravages of diseases </p><p>nor fatalities through accidents and that, youth </p><p>being more impulsive and reckless than maturity, </p><p>the percentage of accidents and disease would be </p><p>greater, while many persons would not care to avail </p><p>themselves of the treatment. Montross also pointed </p><p>out that the benefits derived by scientists and other </p><p>intellectuals being able to carry on indefinitely </p><p>would more than offset any dangers of overpopula- </p><p>tion, and that, unquestionably, these men with their </p><p>discoveries would be able to solve any such problems </p><p>which might arise. He himself, he stated, would </p><p>devote his entire life to producing artificial foods, </p><p>thus reducing the areas essential to growing crops </p><p>and rendering more space available for industries</p><p>and housing. For my own part, T declared that it </p><p>would be extremely selfish to retain the secret, and </p><p>that we would, I felt sure, be heartily sick of youth </p><p>if we found ourselves still young while all our </p><p>friends and acquaintances were aging and our asso- </p><p>ciates through decades were to be yet unborn gen- </p><p>erations. We have also discussed the question of </p><p>our discovery producing immortality. None of us </p><p>believe this will be possible, and I do not think any </p><p>of us believe it desirabe. Burke is a devout Roman </p><p>Catholic: Redfield is a pillar of the Episcopal </p><p>church; E. is very religious and a member of the </p><p>Methodist church; Montross is an Episcopalian and </p><p>while I profess no particular religion I am a firm </p><p>believer in the omnipotence of the Creator and His </p><p>wisdom. I believe, too, in a future existence of some </p><p>sort, and neither the others nor myself would wish </p><p>to forego the chances of such a state. Moreover, </p><p>none of us, with the possible exception of some of </p><p>my young and ultra-modern students, believe that </p><p>man has the power to change the laws of Nature or </p><p>to accomplish anything in opposition to the will of </p><p>God. To prevent the visual ravages of time upon </p><p>the system would, we all agree, be no violation of </p><p>Nature’s inexorable laws, whereas immortality </p><p>would be in direct opposition to the entire scheme </p><p>of things. To increase the span of life, and to re- </p><p>tain the faculties of youth during that life, would </p><p>be a blessing, but to live on forever would be a </p><p>curse. . . . </p><p> “We have carried on very extensive tests with va-</p><p>rious organisms, both vegetable and animal. We find </p><p>that, as Montross expected, the new element Juvc- </p><p>num is the active principle, but we have met with an </p><p>unexpected obstacle. While the lower forms of life </p><p>respond to the treatment and become rejuvenated, </p><p>or do not age, yet they soon cease to function or die. </p><p>What a calamity it would be if man, in his desire </p><p>for youth, should be compelled to shorten his exist- </p><p>ence, to flit, like a butterfly, for a brief space and </p><p>then die while in the possession of the youth he </p><p>sought! Perhaps, after all, our lives as they are, </p><p>are preferable; perhaps old age has its advantages. </p><p>However, we feel that the trouble is not insurmount- </p><p>able, that by experimenting we can produce the </p><p>desired effects without the unfortunate results. . . . </p><p>C£'\X/'E have hit it! Purely by accident we—for I </p><p>’ ’ must give credit to my assistants, and espe- </p><p>cially to Burke who is the last man in the world one </p><p>would expect to make a discovery--purely by </p><p>accident, I say, we have solved the problem. To </p><p>while away the time, Burke brought a radio receiv- </p><p>ing set to the laboratory. One of the receptacles</p><p>containing the organisms treated with Juvenum </p><p>was close to the set, and whereas all other treated </p><p>organisms died after a few days, those beside the </p><p>radio set continued to live and thrive with remark- </p><p>able vigor. Burke, oddly enough, was the first to </p><p>notice it, and called our attention to it. Johnson, </p><p>one of my students, is a radio enthusiast and pos- </p><p>sesses an intimate knowledge of the apparatus. He </p><p>declared that the electro-magnetic waves, or the </p><p>electrons from the tubes, must have been instru- </p><p>mental in producing the results, and we at once pro- </p><p>ceeded to experiment along these lines. Unques- </p><p>tionably Johnson was right. Organisms, both ani- </p><p>mal and vegetable, exposed to the vacuum tubes’ </p><p>action and treated with Juvenum become rejuve- </p><p>nated and thrive prodigiously, whereas others sim- </p><p>ilarly treated, but kept from the tubes’ influence, </p><p>expire rapidly. The question now is, do the re- </p><p>juvenated organisms retain their vigor and condi- </p><p>tion after a certain duration of exposure to the </p><p>tubes or is the action of the radio energy essential </p><p>in order for them to exist? . . . </p><p> “Perpetual youth is within our grasp! Once or-</p><p>ganisms are treated with Juvenum and subjected </p><p>to the vacuum tubes’ action, they retain their vigor </p><p>and continue to live without aging. We now have </p><p>482 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>a number which for several weeks have remained </p><p>unchanged, yet which, under normal conditions, </p><p>would have died of old age long ago. We are now </p><p>ready to test our methods upon higher forms of </p><p>life. Tomorrow we shall treat rabbits and guinea </p><p>pigs, some potted plants and some birds. Montross </p><p>has an ancient toothless dog of which he is very </p><p>fond, but which he must destroy very soon. He is </p><p>to try the effect of our treatment upon the beast. </p><p>E. has offered a parrot which has been for many </p><p>years in her family and which shows evidences of </p><p>extreme age. Johnson facetiously offered to steal </p><p>a decrepit cab horse and bring the creature to the </p><p>laboratory, while Burke declared the best subject </p><p>would be our octogenarian state senator, and Red- </p><p>field suggested that we try the treatment on the </p><p>local trolley line. We are all so elated that such </p><p>nonsense is forgivable, and we are all terribly in </p><p>earnest and are under such a nerve strain that we </p><p>must find an outlet, for our feelings. That we are </p><p>on the verge of proving the epochal discovery we </p><p>have made, 1 am convinced, for microscopic exam- </p><p>inations of the cells and tissues which I have pre- </p><p>pared show undeniable proofs of marvelous rejuve- </p><p>nation and increased vigor and resistance. . . . </p><p> “We cannot believe our senses. Every experi-</p><p>ment has been a tremendous success. Three days </p><p>ago Montross’s dog was a miserable half-blind, </p><p>toothless thing and today he is frisking about like </p><p>a puppy; he can see almost as well as ever and </p><p>teeth are sprouting from his gums. E.’s ancient </p><p>parrot is gay with the plumage of a young bird, </p><p>he talks and chatters constantly, and climbs about </p><p>like an acrobat. So marvelous were the results </p><p>that Burke, Redfield, Johnson and several of the </p><p>others insisted on taking the treatment despite </p><p>my advice, for I fear there are possibilities which </p><p>we did not foresee and which may not be alto- </p><p>gether desirable. I had sought for means of re- </p><p>taining youth, but our discovery goes beyond that </p><p>and restores youth. In all probability further re- </p><p>searches and experiments will enable us to ad- </p><p>minister a treatment in such a manner that almost </p><p>any desired condition of maturity may be attained </p><p>and permanently fixed, but at present we cannot </p><p>be sure how much of age will be wiped away and </p><p>how much of youthfulness will be restored. Earn- </p><p>estly I pointed out to Burke and Redfield that it </p><p>would be far from desirable or pleasant if, after </p><p>taking a treatment, they should be transformed to </p><p>beardless boys, irresponsible youngsters whom no </p><p>one would recognize. But they were adamant. </p><p>They argued that by taking a light treatment they </p><p>could test, out the powers of the Juvenum, that as</p><p>they had made the experiments possible they </p><p>should be entitled to be the first to test the effects </p><p>of the discovery, and that they hadn’t the slightest </p><p>fear of its restoring too much of their past youth. </p><p>Johnson and the others sided with them, and at </p><p>last, realizing, I fear a bit selfishly, that some one </p><p>had to be the first to take the test. T consented. </p><p> “But I insisted that only a very light, almost</p><p>superficial, treatment should be given, and to this </p><p>they consented. I have watched them carefully; </p><p>E. has kept accurate records of their pulse, respir- </p><p>ation and temperature, and we find that they </p><p>already show distinct signs of slight rejuvenation. </p><p>Johnson and the other young men show it the </p><p>most markedly, but this is to be expected of course, </p><p>as their systems are more responsive and less de- </p><p>terioration of cells and tissues renders the action </p><p>of the treatment more rapid. . . . </p><p> “Everything is most satisfactory. Burke and</p><p>Redfield look like men of forty, and declare they </p><p>feel better than they have felt for years. Johnson </p><p>has the fresh color and spirits of twenty, and his </p><p>companions are in practically the same condition. </p><p>Today, Montross took the treatment, and E. in- </p><p>sists she will do so tomorrow. Of course, in that </p><p>case, I can do no less than follow, and yet, some- </p><p>how, I have a premonition that we have not. yet </p><p>learned all the powers or peculiarities of Juvenum, </p><p>and that we have been over-hasty in submitting </p><p>ourselves to the tests. . . . </p><p> "A terrible thing has happened. My worst fears</p><p>have been confirmed. We have all taken the treat- </p><p>ment and we are all in the same awful predicament. </p><p> “For several days the animals treated remained</p><p>in the same state to which they had been altered </p><p>by the treatment. Then, to my horror and amaze- </p><p>ment, I noticed that the dog and parrot were show- </p><p>ing signs of growing constantly younger. The </p><p>cur was acting more and more like a puppy; the </p><p>parrot was losing its full plumage and was ac- </p><p>quiring pin-feathers. I hurried to the apartments </p><p>of Burke and Redfield and found both men in seclu- </p><p>sion. Burke, who had been a stout, florid man of </p><p>sixty had become unrecognizable as a young man </p><p>of thirty,— slender, freckle-faced and red-haired. </p><p>Redfield’s alteration was even worse. From the </p><p>paunchy, gray-whiskered banker he had become </p><p>transformed into a sallow-faced young man. and. </p><p>catching a glimpse of myself in a mirror, T dis- </p><p>covered that I, too, have lost ten years in appear- </p><p>ance. Almost too distraught to express my fears </p><p>I rushed madly to E.’s office. But instead of the </p><p>woman T had expected to wed I found a beautiful</p><p>girl who, outwardly at least, appeared 110 more </p><p>than twenty years of age. She, however, did not </p><p>share my fears. She was overjoyed at the recovery </p><p>of her youthful beauty and she was elated at the </p><p>change which had taken place in myself. In vain </p><p>I tried to explain to her that if the rejuvenation </p><p>process continued we would all be regarded as </p><p>mere boys and girls; that already Burke and Red- </p><p>field were afraid to appear before their employees. </p><p> “But she. perhaps because of her medical and</p><p>anatomical knowledge, argued that my fears were </p><p>groundless. We were, as I well knew, in full </p><p>possession of all the knowledge and experience we </p><p>had acquired during our lives. Regardless of </p><p>physical appearances we were mature, experienced, </p><p>and fully developed mentally, and. she added, un- </p><p>questionably the banker and merchant, with their </p><p>youthful frame and vigor, could accomplish far </p><p>more than in their physically aged condition. </p><p>« A FTER a time I felt that perhaps she was </p><p> 1± right. But I still feared that the process of</p><p>rejuvenation might continue, that no one could fore- </p><p>tell when it would cease. </p><p> “The only thing to do was to devote all of our</p><p>energies to finding a means to control the action </p><p>of the Juvenum, and I summoned Montross and the </p><p>THE ULTRA-ELIXIR OF YOUTH </p><p>483 </p><p>others, who had all leaped backwards for from ten </p><p>to fifteen years. I explained my fears and the </p><p>necessity of finding some means to check or con- </p><p>trol the action of our discovery. </p><p> “For a few days the effects of the treatment ap-</p><p>peared to cease of their own accord, and no marked </p><p>physical changes took place. Then, as if by magic, </p><p>the rejuvenation process took hold once more, and </p><p>in a few days Burke and Redfield had become </p><p>scarcely more than youths. Johnson was a mere </p><p>lad, while E. and myself, who had been the last </p><p>to take the treatment and who had taken far less </p><p>than the others, felt and looked like a youth and </p><p>girl of eighteen. Burke and Redfield were beside </p><p>themselves. They had important business to at- </p><p>tend to, and already their absence from their </p><p>offices was causing uneasiness. All seemed to look </p><p>to me for a way out of their difficulties, and, with- </p><p>out effect, I tried to make them see that they were </p><p>the ones who had insisted when I had cautioned </p><p>and that, moreover, I had shown my faith in sub- </p><p>mitting to the treatment. </p><p> '“Realizing that no one would recognize the banker</p><p>or the merchant, I suggested that they go to their </p><p>offices, put their business in order, and then re- </p><p>tire to their apartments until I had had an oppor- </p><p>tunity to carry on further tests of formula Mon- </p><p>tross and myself had worked out. . . . </p><p> "We are all lost. Nothing we can do will check</p><p>the effect of the Juvenum. E. and myself are so </p><p>changed that when, yesterday, we went to her </p><p>office to secure some things she wanted, her house- </p><p>keeper did not recognize us. We have all been </p><p>obliged to purchase the garments of young people. </p><p>And Burke and Redfield are worse off than any of </p><p>the rest. Whether they received larger amounts </p><p>of Juvenum than the others; whether, as I sus- </p><p>pect, they surreptitiously treated themselves a </p><p>second time, or whether the Juvenum acts more </p><p>rapidly upon old persons, I do not know. But </p><p>yesterday when, after repeated calls by phone, I </p><p>got no reply and went to their apartments, I felt </p><p>that I must be going mad. Burke had become a </p><p>gawky boy of twelve and Redfield was unrecogniz- </p><p>able as a lad of fifteen. Both were frenzied, both </p><p>begged me to secure proper garments for them, </p><p>and both were indescribably pitiful objects to be- </p><p>hold—mere children with the brains, the intelli- </p><p>gence, the knowledge, the thoughts of grown, ex- </p><p>perienced men. </p><p> “The only redeeming feature of the day was my</p><p>marriage to E. We both felt that if we waited </p><p>longer no minister would marry us, fearing we </p><p>were under age, but our happiness we fear will </p><p>be short lived. We all know now what is to follow. </p><p>We all know that we are past human help unless </p><p>a miracle occurs. Ours is an agony almost beyond </p><p>endurance. The poor rejuvenated dog which Mon- </p><p>tross, poor fellow, offered in the cause of science, </p><p>has proven an object lesson to us, has brought </p><p>home to us the terrible consequence of attempting </p><p>to interfere with the plan of the Creator. The </p><p>creature is now a toothless, purblind puppy, while </p><p>the parrot is a fledgling, raucous-voiced and almost </p><p>naked. Did ever human beings face a like fate? </p><p>If we are to believe the evidences of our senses </p><p>we are slowly, but all too rapidly, growing con- </p><p>stantly younger. In a short time,—God knows </p><p>when,—we will be squalling, helpless babies! </p><p>Already Burke and Redfield are toddling about, </p><p>supporting themselves by chairs and burbling unin- </p><p>telligible words. Surreptitiously and at night E. </p><p>and I managed to kidnap them from their rooms </p><p>and bring them here. They were then boys of </p><p>eight. And by dint of threats, by argument and </p><p>through their own agony of suspense, I have man- </p><p>aged to gather all the others together here in my </p><p>laboratory. All I say, but Montross, Johnson and </p><p>two others are missing. What has become of them </p><p>we do not know. Perhaps they have committed </p><p>suicide, perhaps they have gone mad, perhaps </p><p>they have rushed madly away seeking to escape </p><p>the inexorable fate before them. . . . </p><p> “Such horror! I feel that I must go mad. Were</p><p>it not for E. I would make away with myself. I </p><p>know now what has become of Montross, Johnson </p><p>and the others. I have found a note from Mon- </p><p>tross stating that he and Johnson had agreed to </p><p>make a supreme test, to make a brave effort to </p><p>avert the horrible fate to which we were doomed, </p><p>to strive to check the accursed Juvenum by taking </p><p>a stronger dose, in a hope, a mere chance that, like </p><p>some poisons, one treatment would offset the other. </p><p>What happened I know only too well. It is in- </p><p>credible! The thing is unthinkable, but true! The </p><p>dog, two days ago, was a feeble puppy; yesterday it </p><p>was a blind, newly-born, tiny thing; today it has </p><p>vanished! The parrot became a fledgling, yester- </p><p>day a round white egg appeared in its cage. Today </p><p>the cage is empty. Nature is being reversed! </p><p>With incredible speed we and all life subjected to </p><p>the damnable treatment of Juvenum, are progress- </p><p>ing backward. Beyond doubt Montross and the </p><p>others have already vanished, have already passed </p><p>back to the embryonic state, even to the unknown, </p><p>unsolved mysterious source whence comes all life. </p><p>My wife and I, of all the ten, remain as rational</p><p>human beings. Burke and Redfield are gurgling, </p><p>cooing, helpless babies whose wants occupy all of </p><p>our time. And my heart is wrenched each time I </p><p>look at my darling wife. No longer is she a woman, </p><p>no longer a budding girl. She is a slim wisp of </p><p>femininity perhaps twelve years of age, but still </p><p>possessing all her womanly instincts, all her knowl- </p><p>edge of medicine, all the thoughts, the longings, </p><p>the ambitions that were hers when, seemingly ages </p><p>ago, we first discussed the question of perpetual </p><p>youth. </p><p> “But bravely, uncomplainingly, she has borne the</p><p>ordeal which we are passing through. She has </p><p>never blamed me; she is as patient, as smiling as </p><p>cheerful as ever, though she knows that only a </p><p>few days remain before she, too, will be a helpless </p><p>infant. </p><p> “And the utter horror of it all, the most terrible</p><p>part of the whole affair, is that even to the last </p><p>minute, even though they crow and cry and drool </p><p>like normal infants, Burke, Redfield and the others </p><p>possess the intellects, the brains, the sensations </p><p>of their mature years. I can see it, and I shiver </p><p>with terror at the sight, for the agony of mind </p><p>which is theirs is stamped upon their baby faces. </p><p>484 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>&lt;ct CAN scarcely bear to write. Redfield, Burke </p><p> A and the others have gone. Yesterday they</p><p>were there, tiny, red-faced, toothless, newly-born </p><p>babies, and today no trace of their presence re- </p><p>mains. And my wife! As I write, she who was </p><p>my beloved Elvira is creeping about the floor, </p><p>while I, the last of the ten to succumb to the </p><p>effects of our accursed experiments, sit at the </p><p>desk, torn with unbearable dread, with indescrib- </p><p>able horror at the fate which, so unconsciously, I </p><p>have brought upon my wife and the others. And </p><p>though I am writing this in the same hand which </p><p>1 used when a full grown man, although I have </p><p>felt, no change in my brain, yet I am but a youth, </p><p>a mere stripling, a beardless boy of perhaps a </p><p>dozen years. Were it not for Elvira, were it not </p><p>that until her last moment I must care for her, </p><p>I would follow the example of Montross and John- </p><p>son and would hasten my end by taking a double </p><p>dose of Juvenum. But instead, I have destroyed </p><p>everything. Every chemical, every formula, every- </p><p>thing to do with the damnable affair has been made </p><p>away with. Never shall the world know how to </p><p>do what we have done if I can prevent it. Nothing </p><p>shall be left that will lie available for others. And </p><p>as soon as Elvira has drifted backward into that </p><p>unfathomable beyond whence all life comes, I shall </p><p>face the most terrible fate of all. No one will be </p><p>left to care for me. I shall be a helpless infant </p><p>and. must, I feel sure, go through the retrocessional </p><p>process to oblivion, for I long ago promised Elvira </p><p>that I would not take my own life, and, I feel sure, </p><p>I will not be granted the solace of starving to </p><p>death, for I am convinced that this whole horrible </p><p>nightmarish affair is but a reversion of life as </p><p>it has been for us; that time has been turned back, </p><p>as related to our own existence, that if we sur- </p><p>vived the perils of infantile mortality nothing can </p><p>prevent us from retroceeding in the same manner, </p><p>and that, as long as T did not starve to death while </p><p>an infant, I cannot hope to succumb to starvation </p><p>now that my infancy is to be repeated, even though </p><p>there are no loving hands to care for me. </p><p> "And another strange thing has happened. Of</p><p>late I have been aware of the presence of beings </p><p>about me. They are invisible, intangible, but I </p><p>feel their nearness. Are they the spirits of my </p><p>companions? Can it be possible that, having gone </p><p>back beyond the stage of human form at birth, </p><p>they have been unable to return to embryonic </p><p>form, and are still filling the atmosphere about </p><p>me? . . . </p><p> "These will be my last lines. My beloved wife</p><p>has gone. To the very end she seemed happy. In </p><p>her baby eyes, as I tenderly, though clumsily fed </p><p>her, was the look of contentment; her baby mouth </p><p>smiled, and there was none of the agony which </p><p>contorted the infantile countenances of Burke, </p><p>Redfield and the others. This morning she faded </p><p>from sight and vanished, and I feel that some- </p><p>where she is watching me and waiting for me. I </p><p>am more resigned to my fate now. And for the </p><p>first time I have given thought to matters aside </p><p>from our own affairs. What, I wonder, will the </p><p>world think when it finds that ten members of its </p><p>population have inexplicably vanished into thin </p><p>air? No doubt there will be investigations; the </p><p>police will be called in; but only to make the mys- </p><p>tery the greater. What will they think when they </p><p>find the baby clothes which have served for Burke, </p><p>Redfield and even for Elvira in turn? Only I will </p><p>be without the tiny garments. Long before my </p><p>body is small enough for them I will be unable to </p><p>dress myself. I will shrink to an infant in the </p><p>clothes I have on, in the makeshift, cut-down things </p><p>I am wearing, and crawling from them, a naked </p><p>infant, I shall probably find them an interesting </p><p>plaything. Strange, now that my fate is so near </p><p>at hand, I am so calm, that I can see the humor of </p><p>the situation. But my great regret is that after </p><p>today I will be unable to record my sensations. </p><p>Even if my mind remains mature my childish hand </p><p>will be unable to hold a pen or form the letters. </p><p>I am now a child of eight or ten years in appear- </p><p>ance and physical characters, and I am forced to </p><p>sit upon a pile of books in order to write. Ever </p><p>since this morning I have realized I am dwindling. </p><p>I have been forced to add two books to the pile. </p><p>But before I am unable to do so T must make some </p><p>preparations. I will place this journal among the </p><p>infant's garments and other things in a drawer </p><p>beyond my own reach, for otherwise, in my infantile </p><p>state, T may tear and destroy the onlv record I can </p><p>leave of the incredible events which have transpired </p><p>here in my laboratory. I can write no more, My </p><p>brain is still clear and filled with the thoughts of </p><p>a grown man,—yes even the scientific side of my </p><p>intellect is unchanged. But I find the pen difficult </p><p>to hold, and my childish fingers can scarcely form </p><p>the characters I wish to write. And there is no </p><p>more to record. I have sought perpetual youth </p><p>and I have found it; but such a youth! Youth re- </p><p>duced to the nth degree, the utter youth of in- </p><p>visible existence, the youth of the pre-natal, inex- </p><p>plicable germ of life, perhaps the-” </p><p> The journal ended in an undecipherable scrawl.</p><p>Trembling, shaken, pale with the suspense of what </p><p>I had read, I sat staring, and was aware for the</p><p>first time that the vast laboratory was dusky with </p><p>approaching night. Then, with a stifled cry, I </p><p>sprang to my feet. An Invisible, intangible pres- </p><p>ence seemed to be near. I could have sworn that </p><p>fingers clutched my clothes. With my scalp ting- </p><p>ling, terrified as I had never been in my life, I </p><p>fled from the room which, despite common sense </p><p>and reason, I felt sure was still tenanted by the </p><p>missing ten. And T was even more terrified as </p><p>another thought flashed across my mind. How </p><p>did I know that some of the terrible element, Juve- </p><p>num, might not have remained in the laboratory? </p><p>How could I be sure that I had not inadvertently </p><p>exposed myself to its effects? How could I be </p><p>positive that I, too, might not find myself going </p><p>backward, doomed eventually to pass out like a </p><p>snuffed-out candle? Never again, I determined, </p><p>would I enter the laboratory. I would resign the </p><p>next day, I would return to my former work, and, </p><p>for a space I knew, I would live in deadly fear of </p><p>signs of regained youthfulness. </p><p> But fate took a hand in my plans. That night</p><p>a disastrous fire swept McCracken College, the </p><p>laboratory with all its contents was utterly de- </p><p>stroyed, and to this day the true explanation of </p><p>THE ULTRA-ELIXIR OF YOUTH </p><p>485 </p><p>the disappearance of Dr. Henderson and the nine </p><p>others has never been published. </p><p> And ray fears proved groundless. I grew no</p><p>younger, as the months passed, and when, a year </p><p>after reading Dr. Henderson’s amazing journal, </p><p>my wife found several gray hairs over my temples, </p><p>I felt sure that all danger of my having been </p><p>exposed to the perils of perpetual youth were </p><p>over. </p><p> And, as Dr. Henderson’s diary has burned to</p><p>ashes with the rest of his possessions, and I fear </p><p>that the vivid memory of its contents might grow </p><p>dim if I delay longer, 1 have decided that the </p><p>world shall know the truth. </p><p> The End</p><p> Readers’ Vote of Preference</p><p>Stories I Like </p><p> Stories I Do Not Like:</p><p>Remarks </p><p> (1)..</p><p> (2)..</p><p> (3)..</p><p>(1) ..................................... </p><p>(2) ..................................... </p><p> Do you like the illustrations as we have them now?</p><p> Do you favor more illustrations than we have now?</p><p> Would you rather not have any illustrations at all?.....</p><p> Tlii» i&gt; YOUR magazine.

He seemed to harbor no suspicions that his </p><p>ideas might be appropriated by others for their </p><p>own profit. Or perhaps the tremendous difficulties </p><p>lying in the path of accomplishment made him sim- </p><p>ply scorn the ability of others to succeed, where he </p><p>might fail. Then again, it may have been that he </p><p>talked far less freely to others than he did to me. </p><p>For that Schirmanhever did like me in his strange, </p><p>impersonal way, I can have no doubt—I call myself </p><p>his best friend because I know he had no other. </p><p> I first met Schirmanhever when he was living in</p><p>a tumbledown cabin on a beach north of New York </p><p>City. He was introduced to me in town one day </p><p>by a mutual acquaintance, and something about his </p><p>features—I think it must have been the brilliance </p><p>of his eyes—enlisted my interest immediately. He </p><p>was about thirty-five at the time, tall and thin, with </p><p>dark thick hair that fell low over his forehead and </p><p>straggled down his neck. He wore a shabby light- </p><p>weight overcoat, and looked generally unkempt. </p><p>Still, he had a striking personality. One felt his </p><p>frail, undernourished body was overengined with </p><p>mind. He seemed burn- </p><p>ing up with ideas, though	—</p><p>he said little. I grew to </p><p>like Schirmanhever, and </p><p>after my first visit I went </p><p>again as often as I could </p><p>manage it without seem- </p><p>ing to impose on his hos- </p><p>pitality. And in the light </p><p>of subsequent events</p><p>those visits of mine to his </p><p>cabin on that astonishing </p><p>beach made especially — </p><p>vivid memories. </p><p> It was an astonishing beach. It represented the</p><p>last small stretch of coast near the great metropolis </p><p>to hold out against invasion by the summer hordes. </p><p>The cabin was situated among a low ridge of sand- </p><p>dunes separating the ocean from inland waters. </p><p>Between the dunes and the bay ran a long narrow </p><p>spit of marsh. It was because the ground here was </p><p>so marshy, and would have to be drained and filled </p><p>in before any building could be done, that this </p><p>stretch of beach had remained undeveloped; on </p><p>either side of it, two miles distant, were large shore </p><p>resorts. The beach, piled high with great timbers, </p><p>packing cases, cans, bottles, and other riff-raff flung </p><p>up by the tides, presented an astonishingly wild and </p><p>disordered appearance. At night, in both directions, </p><p>a million lights traced the distant coast line; to the </p><p>southwest, in clear weather, might be seen the </p><p>fainter glimmer of the Coney Island boardwalk, be- </p><p>yond the Rockaways. </p><p> Here Schirmanhever lived the year round. Dilap-</p><p>idated in appearance, the cabin was quite snug in- </p><p>side. A chunk stove kept it warm on the coldest </p><p>days, and wood cost Schirmanhever nothing, as it </p><p>lay at his very doorstep on the beach in inexhaust- </p><p>ible supplies and the dunes held back the strong sea- </p><p>breezes. He bought his stores each week at a fish- </p><p>ing station across the bay. </p><p> But on my first visit to this isolated .spot I became</p><p>curious to know how he solved the problem of water. </p><p>It seemed bad enough to have to tramp such a dis- </p><p>tance for food supplies, but how could he manage </p><p>to have so much water at hand? There was a suffi- </p><p>cient supply of water at the cabin, not only for </p><p>drinking and cooking, but for washing also. I was </p><p>too interested in talking to Schirmanhever, and </p><p>noting the equipment of that part of the cabin cur- </p><p>tained off from the rest which he called his lab- </p><p>oratory, to wonder about his supply of fresh water, </p><p>but no sooner was I alone on the train returning </p><p>to the city than I found myself speculating about </p><p>this. Did Schirmanhever have a well? I dis- </p><p>missed this conjecture as absurd since water from </p><p>any well sunk in those sand dunes would certainly </p><p>be quite undrinkable. But where did he get it? </p><p>Suddenly I remembered that the same problem </p><p>must have existed for the old hermit who had been </p><p>the cabin’s previous inhabitant. This convinced </p><p>me that whatever the problem’s solution might be, </p><p>it could not be very mysterious. </p><p> Still I was puzzled, especially when on my next</p><p>visit, I noticed that Schirmanhever, who happened </p><p>to be over on the mainland laying in supplies when </p><p>I arrived, was taking back nothing but provisions. </p><p> Later, in the cabin, I</p><p>——mentioned the water prob- </p><p>lem to him. </p><p> “Yes, water was old</p><p>Martin’s problem,” said </p><p>Schirmanhever. “He had </p><p>to bring it over from the </p><p>mainland, as I did at the </p><p>beginning. It was the </p><p>main reason he had for </p><p>leaving here. Of course,” </p><p>he added, after a moment’s </p><p>....... pause, “I don’t have that </p><p> problem any more.”</p><p> The last few words he said willingly, and his ex-</p><p>pression increased my interest. “How’s that?” I </p><p>asked. “Have you found a nearer place to get it?” </p><p>“I don’t get it,” he answered. “I make it.” </p><p> “Oh!” I exclaimed, with a laugh at my own fool-</p><p>ishness. “Of course! You distill it.” </p><p>Schirmanhever smiled again. “No,” he said, “I </p><p>don’t distill it. But I make it just the same.” </p><p> He got up to open the chunk stove, and throw in</p><p>another piece of wood. Outside a strong raw wind </p><p>was blowing, rattling the sashes of one of the small </p><p>windows. Even though you could not see it, you </p><p> TN presenting to our renders, one, who for Amazing</p><p> Stories is a new author, we believe that you will</p><p> soon find that lie is a promising scientifirtion writer.</p><p> The plot in this story is unusual, and at the same time</p><p> most convincing. After all. why should there be no</p><p> such thing as a chemical magnet? Any good chemist</p><p> will tell you that the thing is not impossible per se, and</p><p> that sooner or later it may be a fact.

Subse- </p><p>quently, when through our general conversa- </p><p>tions I had got an idea of the nature of his investi- </p><p>gations, he was less reserved. I knew then that </p><p>he had delved very profoundly into the nature of </p><p>chemical reactions, particularly those of solubility. </p><p>He had the sort of mind that sees things always </p><p>from the imaginative viewpoint, that never allows </p><p>imagination to become smothered beneath technical </p><p>and mathematical detail. He was able to arrive </p><p>at an actual picture of molecular processes, and </p><p>for this reason he was able to make his tremendous </p><p>discoveries. </p><p> One day, drawing back the curtain of his labora-</p><p>tory, he picked up a beaker, filled it with water, and </p><p>asked me to drop some table salt into it. When I </p><p>had done so, he said: </p><p> “That wasn’t much trouble, was it? But what</p><p>a lot of trouble to get that salt back again—I mean </p><p>by evaporation. There should be an easier way, </p><p>shouldn’t there?” </p><p> I replied I thought there should be. Schirman-</p><p>hever now placed a clean sheet of white paper on </p><p>the bench. On the paper he put a handful of sand </p><p>that he had picked up outside. With the sand he </p><p>mixed up several pinches of iron filings. </p><p> “Now,” he asked, “do you know any easy way of</p><p>getting those filings back again?” </p><p> “Well,” I said, “if you had a magnet—”</p><p>“Exactly!” He produced one, and drew the </p><p>filings out of the sand, scraping them off the mag- </p><p>net into a little separate pile. Then he looked at </p><p>me. “By my process I can draw salts out of water </p><p>just as easily as that magnet draws iron filings out </p><p>of the sand. Let’s say I’ve invented a chemical </p><p>magnet.” </p><p> He smiled to himself, and added, “That’s an in-</p><p>accurate way of putting it, of course, but it gives </p><p>the imagination something to feed on, which is the </p><p>main thing. What I have devised is a way of get- </p><p>ting salts out of water without having to use any </p><p>energy. No heat under boilers, no electric current.</p><p>As simple as that,” he snapped his fingers. “And </p><p>why shouldn’t it be easy ? There’s very little energy </p><p>change when most salts are dissolved in water. In </p><p>fact, what energy change there is is usually to the </p><p>good—the water is cooled off a little by the addi- </p><p>tion of the salt, so that there should be energy </p><p>given out, not taken in, when you get the salt back </p><p>—and there is.” </p><p> He glanced at one corner of his laboratory where</p><p>there stood a queer closet-like arrangement with </p><p>pipes leading in and out—evidently a casing around </p><p>some concealed apparatus. “Want to see it work?” </p><p>he asked. </p><p> I nodded. I had noticed that corner of the lab-</p><p>oratory before, and half-guessed its significance. </p><p>But this was the first time Schirmanhever had of- </p><p>fered any information about it. Now he picked up </p><p>a pailful of sea-water, and poured it into a large </p><p>funnel that protruded upwards from the wooden </p><p>casing. When the water had all vanished into the </p><p>interior he came around to the front of the casing </p><p>and turned a valve. A moment later a bucket he </p><p>had placed on the floor began filling up. Schirman- </p><p>hever, lifting the bucket so that the water would </p><p>flow noiselessly down the side, motioned to me to </p><p>listen. I heard in the interior of the apparatus a </p><p>soft, continuous sound similar to that which might </p><p>be made by tiny grains of something slipping down </p><p>a chute. When the flow of water had stopped, the </p><p>bucket being nearly full, Schirmanhever lifted a </p><p>dipperful of it up to my lips—it was as fresh pure </p><p>water as I have ever tasted. At the same moment </p><p>he held up for my inspection a miniature bin that </p><p>he had drawn out of the interior of his apparatus; </p><p>its floor was covered with several inches of a whit- </p><p>ish salt. </p><p> "Now,” he said, pouring the contents of the little</p><p>bin into the bucket of fresh water, “you see before </p><p>you the pailful of sea-water again.” </p><p> The whole process had taken so short a time—</p><p>scarcely more than a couple of minutes—and its </p><p>operation had been so noiseless, no sound coming </p><p>from the interior of the machine except that little </p><p>whispering noise made by the settling salt, that I </p><p>could only stand amazed. </p><p> “You mean to say,” I exclaimed, “that that water</p><p>I drank”—and I looked at what remained in the </p><p>dipper—“was some of the sea-water—and that </p><p>that salt you showed me-” ' </p><p> “It was,” answered Schirmanhever. “The very</p><p>same sea-water. My apparatus in here,” he tapped</p><p>the wooden casing, “had simply divided it into its </p><p>two components—the pure water and the dissolved </p><p>salts.” </p><p> “And it got it all out in that short time?”</p><p> Schirmanhever smiled at the incredulity in my</p><p>face. Then he frowned. “Yes, it got it all out, and </p><p>that’s my trouble. That wate^ you tasted was pure </p><p>as rain water. But my process won’t select yet. </p><p>It pulls salts and suspended matter out in one lot. </p><p>The hardest part of my job—that of developing </p><p>selective attraction for the various chemicals in so- </p><p>lution, in the same way you might have different </p><p>magnets for iron, copper, silver, gold and so on,— </p><p>is still before me. Indeed, I don’t know whether </p><p>I’ll ever be able to solve that problem. And if I </p><p>don’t—” His brilliant, feverish eyes stared </p><p>straight into mine, and I read in them the end of </p><p>the sentence—that if he didn’t, all the knowledge </p><p>he had acquired thus far would die with him. </p><p> This was the thing that astounded me. Once I</p><p>realized Schirmanhever’s invention actually would </p><p>extract salts from solution with such ease, it </p><p>seemed to me the most marvellous scientific achieve- </p><p>ment of the century. If he stopped at this point, he </p><p>had only to commercialize his process to make an </p><p>immense fortune for himself. But Schirmanhever </p><p>seemed to think he had accomplished nothing as </p><p>yet. His whole being was wrapped up in making </p><p>the process the entirely perfect thing he had </p><p>dreamed it. </p><p> “There!” he would exclaim, gesturing dramatic-</p><p>ally towards the leagues of ocean, “just look at </p><p>the immensity of it! A greater storehouse of min- </p><p>erals than you’ll find in all the mines of the earth </p><p>put together. All the metallic and non-metallic ele- </p><p>ments in it in some shape or form. Vast Mother </p><p>Ocean, covering the greater portion of our planet, </p><p>THE CHEMICAL MAGNET </p><p>489 </p><p>miles deep in places, and into which, sooner or </p><p>later, everything gets washed! All the metals, </p><p>even one of the most precious—gold. Yes, gold in </p><p>undreamed of quantities! Scarcely even a trace by </p><p>analysis, but tons and tons when you have an in- </p><p>exhaustible reservoir to comb it out of. When the </p><p>whole ocean is your mine!” </p><p> That word gold would make his eyes take on a</p><p>greater brilliance. I could see he craved power, </p><p>wanted it more than anything in the world. More </p><p>than three years had passed now since I first met </p><p>Schirmanhever, and he was working night and day </p><p>to overcome that problem of selection and also to </p><p>speed up his process of extraction. For, miracu- </p><p>lously quick as this seemed to me, it was not nearly </p><p>quick enough to suit Schirmanhever. He explained </p><p>how, with the millions of tons of sea-water he </p><p>would have to run through his apparatus in order </p><p>to get appreciable amounts of the precious chem- </p><p>icals he wanted most, there could not, if it was to be </p><p>a success, be any appreciable delay in the free flow </p><p>of the current. At present, though he had greatly </p><p>perfected the extraction during the past few years, </p><p>the separation imposed a small but definite drag </p><p>on the moving liquid. This he was seeking to </p><p>eliminate. </p><p>MORE than once, during this period, I doubted </p><p>■Schirmanhever’s sanity. Haggard and wild- </p><p>eyed, his unkempt hair falling around his face, his </p><p>ragged clothes flapping on his thin body, he had at </p><p>times a positively sinister air. Watching him as </p><p>he paced the beach, muttering to himself, and cast- </p><p>ing hungry glances seawards, I wondered if he was </p><p>really in his right mind. With all that driftwood </p><p>piled chaotically on the sand around him, he had </p><p>the appearance of a lone survivor of some tremen- </p><p>dous wreck, driven crazy by solitude and privation, </p><p>desperately watching the horizon for a sign of </p><p>smoke or sail. Years later, I was to “watch him </p><p>pacing in a similar manner another far-distant </p><p>beach—a beach more white and dazzling than this </p><p>one, the very calm of whose tropic beauty was to </p><p>make more dreadful that awful scene of Schirman- </p><p>hever’s final disintegration. Then Schirmanhever, </p><p>the man who had made his dreams come true—too </p><p>true, alas!—did really go mad. </p><p> It occurred to me sometimes that this story of</p><p>a chemical magnet might be only his madness. For, </p><p>remember, that while I saw him put sea-water into </p><p>the machine, and take fresh water and salt out, his </p><p>word was my only proof that the latter were the </p><p>products of the former. Though Schirmanhever</p><p>did not hesitate to discuss with mo, the general </p><p>theories underlying his investigations, he never </p><p>spoke of the details of his process. He frequently </p><p>left the curtains of his laboratory undrawn, so </p><p>that he could talk to me as he worked, but at these </p><p>times the apparatus was always hidden from view </p><p>by its wooden casing, and he was obviously only </p><p>engaged in experiments of minor importance; </p><p>whenever he was working on the apparatus itself, </p><p>which I could tell by the sound of the casing being </p><p>dragged aside, the curtains were always drawn, </p><p>and tied. I began to wonder if inside that casing </p><p>there really was any apparatus, or whether it was </p><p>only a trick arrangement with which Schirman- </p><p>hever’s overstrained mind practised a grotesque </p><p>self-deception. At last, curiosity getting the better </p><p>of all sense of decency, I took advantage of a mo- </p><p>ment when he had gone down to the ocean for </p><p>water, to slip into the laboratory and examine the </p><p>machine. </p><p> Schirmanhever had been in the laboratory for</p><p>over an hour with the curtains drawn. He had </p><p>evidently had to interrupt an experiment to fetch </p><p>more water, for he had left hurriedly, in his haste </p><p>failing to fasten the curtains. I guessed I should </p><p>find the machine exposed to view—if there was any </p><p>—and I was right. The casing, hinged at the back, </p><p>stood open, revealing a short, thick cylinder of </p><p>metal, like a fat water boiler. Except for this cyl- </p><p>inder, and the pipes leading in and out, the space </p><p>inside the casing was absolutely empty. On the </p><p>cylinder a warning, “Hands off! Danger!” was </p><p>painted in large red letters. </p><p> Staring at the cylindei-, I realized I hadn’t</p><p>learned much. Either the cylinder was empty, or </p><p>within it was safely concealed all the vital mech- </p><p>anism of Schirmanhever’s process. And the cylin- </p><p>der apparently had no opening through which the </p><p>eye could penetrate its interior. Then I noticed </p><p>something I had missed at the first glance, a small </p><p>shutter at the top which evidently protected just </p><p>such an observation point as I was in search of. </p><p>Reckless of the red warning on the cylinder, I </p><p>reached out to draw the shutter aside, at the same </p><p>time stooping to put my eye to the opening. </p><p> My hand was grasped in mid-air—Schirman-</p><p>hever stood beside me. He had seen me through </p><p>the window and returned quietly. Instead of be- </p><p>ing angry, as I expected, he brushed aside my con- </p><p>fusion and apologies with the mere remark: </p><p> “You wouldn’t have discovered anything, and you</p><p>might have killed yourself.” </p><p> He closed the casing until I had left the labora-</p><p>tory, then drew the curtains behind me, and re- </p><p>sumed his experiment. He seemed to understand </p><p>perfectly that no motive worse than curiosity had </p><p>prompted me to violate his hospitality. This inci- </p><p>dent, indeed, led him to speak more freely about his </p><p>process than he had done before. He explained </p><p>how, like the French 75-mm. field-piece, the secret </p><p>of whose recoil mechanism is safeguarded against </p><p>detection by the mechanism blowing up and de- </p><p>stroying itself as soon as tampered with by inex- </p><p>pert hands, his invention would also explode if any- </p><p>one but himself tried to examine it. He seemed </p><p>to read my thoughts about the curious simplicity </p><p>of what I had seen—only that cylinder, with the </p><p>pipes leading in and out. </p><p> “You were surprised because you saw nothing</p><p>complicated,” he said. “You expected the aston- </p><p>ishing and the intricate. Why weren’t there any </p><p>wires suggesting electricity? Well, inside that cyl- </p><p>inder it isn’t, of course, quite so simple as it is on </p><p>the outside, but you’d be surprised if you knew </p><p>what simple apparatus the cylinder does contain, </p><p>nevertheless. Simple to your way of thinking, that </p><p>is. Simple and empty in just the same way that </p><p>the interior of an automobile would look simple </p><p>and empty to a person of olden times who was </p><p>hunting everywhere for the horse that made the </p><p>automobile move. Simple and empty as an electric </p><p>490 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>wire carrying current on a million-volt circuit </p><p>would seem to people who didn’t know anything </p><p>about electricity, who never dreamed what power </p><p>was flowing silently along that little wire. My </p><p>process is simple because it depends on an entirely </p><p>new principle. It’s a principle as different from </p><p>any other in the world as, for instance, in the field </p><p>of vision, the color red is different from the color </p><p>blue. And that’s about all I can tell you about it,” </p><p>he finished with a smile, “except from our previous </p><p>talks you may be able to guess that it’s a principle </p><p>depending, not unlike electricity, upon the mys- </p><p>terious laws which control atomic and molecular </p><p>structure.” </p><p> His lips twitched as he smiled. It was one of</p><p>our last talks together—before he went away. </p><p>Schirmanhever had grown very thin and haggard. </p><p>He was experimenting against time. For he had </p><p>only a few months longer to live in the cabin. At </p><p>last this stretch of beach so long neglected by de- </p><p>velopment companies was to be improved. A great </p><p>dredge had arrived on the bay side and was filling </p><p>in the land. Surveyors were staking out the marsh </p><p>into streets and lots. A line of telegraph poles </p><p>sprang up. Schirmanhever watched these opera- </p><p>tions with a dark look of hate. It was the world </p><p>of practicality pursuing him even into the solitude </p><p>of his wild home—driving him out. He had been </p><p>given notice by the development company that he </p><p>could not occupy the land later than the beginning </p><p>of the next summer. </p><p>(it TE has lived here for six years. Has he ac- </p><p> li tually accomplished anything during this</p><p>period?” I used to ask myself. The men working </p><p>for the development company plainly regarded him </p><p>as a crazy freak, and I wondered if they weren’t </p><p>right. Did he really have anything to show for the </p><p>labor of all these years? Or was he simply a man </p><p>obsessed with an idea? </p><p> Then one day the impossible happened. When I</p><p>arrived at the cabin, Schirmanhever told me he </p><p>had inherited a fortune. A rich uncle—on his </p><p>father’s side Schirmanhever was of German de- </p><p>scent, on his mother’s Irish—had just died, and </p><p>left his wealth to him. Schirmanhever told me the </p><p>news without excitement. I confess I would have </p><p>doubted his word, except that the arrival of a stout </p><p>lawyer, puffing from the exertion of the long </p><p>trudge, and with his shoes full of sand, supplied </p><p>an incontrovertible proof. I thought then that </p><p>Schirmanhever’s troubles were over—that the loss</p><p>of the cabin would be of no importance to him, as </p><p>he now had the means to equip a more comfortable </p><p>laboratory in a far more convenient location. But </p><p>Schirmanhever stayed on in the cabin, apparently </p><p>determined to wind up his investigations where </p><p>he had started them. Perhaps the fact that good </p><p>fortune had come his way only when he could al- </p><p>most do without it, made him the more bitter. His </p><p>glances in the direction of that big dredge busily </p><p>filling in the swamp, of those steam shovels tear- </p><p>ing at the sand dunes, held the same personal an- </p><p>tagonism. But one day when I visited him, he </p><p>seemed calmer than ever I had seen him before. </p><p>And as the launch was carrying me away, he called </p><p>after me in a peculiar tone that seemed to carry </p><p>with it, a strange presentiment, “Well, good-bye!” </p><p> It was the last time I was to see Schirmanhever</p><p>for many months. When I next visited the island </p><p>he was gone. The abandoned cabin was being torn </p><p>down by workmen who speculated jokingly on the </p><p>use that had been made of the fragments of ap- </p><p>paratus and glassware left behind. The surveyors </p><p>were shooting the line of a road that would pass </p><p>straight through the site of the cabin. Watching </p><p>it crumbling beneath the blows of sledge and ham- </p><p>mer, I got a sudden sharp sense of loss. I walked </p><p>along the beach, picking my way among the debris </p><p>cast up by the sea, wondering if Schirmanhever </p><p>would write, or if he had gone out of my life for- </p><p>ever. So two years went by. </p><p> Meanwhile all my suspicions about the non-</p><p>existence of his chemical magnet, as he had called </p><p>it, seemed confirmed. I watched the newspapers </p><p>and scientific journals for some startling report of </p><p>the great new discovery. I re-visited the island, </p><p>and its progressive appearance—sidewalks were </p><p>already down, and carpenters hammering on sum- </p><p>mer cottages everywhere—made the past seem a </p><p>dream. I remembered that last glimpse of Schir- </p><p>manhever standing on the shore growing smaller </p><p>as the launch sped for the mainland, and I felt a </p><p>little hurt that that casual “good-bye” had been the </p><p>only warning given me of his departure. And more </p><p>than once, the absurdity of his having accomplished </p><p>anything momentous in that makeshift little build- </p><p>ing by the sea occurred to me, though at the same </p><p>time I could not but recall that the early investiga- </p><p>tions of Steinmetz and other great scientists had </p><p>been conducted in equally humble surroundings. </p><p> During this period of silence I had in my keep-</p><p>ing one little thing to give reality to the'vanished </p><p>Schirmanhever and his splendid aspirations. It </p><p>was a small scrap of paper, the beginning of a let- </p><p>ter I had found in the sea grass on that morning</p><p>when the cabin was being torn down. On it were </p><p>the words: </p><p> “Dear Anne: At last, after all these years, I</p><p>have. . . .” </p><p> The writing was Schirmanhever’s, and he had</p><p>evidently been unable to go any further, or else </p><p>had discarded and thrown away this first attempt at </p><p>a letter to the woman who had rejected his love. </p><p> It was about four years after Schirmanhever’s</p><p>disappearance that I suddenly found his name on </p><p>everyone’s lips. Almost overnight, it seemed, he </p><p>had acquired international renown. The story of </p><p>his marvellous chemical discoveries leaped to the </p><p>front page of the newspapers. I read of the huge </p><p>plants he had built both on the east and west coasts </p><p>which now by some extraordinary secret process </p><p>were producing in abundance almost every known </p><p>chemical. The four years of delay he had appar- </p><p>ently utilized to adapt his process to large-scale </p><p>production. At any rate, the name Schirmanhever </p><p>was now certainly one for the man in the street to </p><p>conjure with. It was rumored he had actually </p><p>found a way of transmuting sea-water into gold. </p><p>It was said this Schirmanhever was on his way to </p><p>becoming the richest man in the world. </p><p> The events of the next few years are history, so</p><p>I shall pass over them briefly. We all remember </p><p>Schirmanhever’s first great industrial triumph, his </p><p>THE CHEMICAL MAGNET </p><p>491 </p><p>breaking up of the potash monopoly, which after </p><p>the world war had reverted to the Kali-syndicate; </p><p>how Schirmanhever’s American plants supplied </p><p>potash to the home markets at half the price of </p><p>the foreign product imported from the great </p><p>Strassfurt deposits; his development of those </p><p>strange and stupendous floating hulks, known as </p><p>the Magnet Fleet, which manufactured their car- </p><p>goes of precious chemicals from ocean water on </p><p>the journey between ports; how Germany’s pre- </p><p>eminence in the field of industrial chemistry waned, </p><p>all that nation’s achievements in building up the </p><p>synthetic dye industry fading to nothing beside the </p><p>colossal accomplishments of the young American </p><p>scientist; the revolutionary shift of industry from </p><p>land to ocean, beginning a new epoch in the history </p><p>of civilization, with the radical alterations it neces- </p><p>sitated in the whole economic life of the world; </p><p>the award to Schirmanhever of the Nobel Prize </p><p>and his rejection of it; the abortive attempt of the </p><p>nations to combat Schirmanhever’s accumulation </p><p>of ocean gold by establishing an international paper </p><p>currency; the sharp drop in worldwide prosperity </p><p>as soon as Schirmanhever ordered production to </p><p>cease at all his plants and popular opinion forcing </p><p>the powers to come to terms; the passing of pov- </p><p>erty everywhere as the hitherto untouched re- </p><p>sources of the ocean—that ocean which covers </p><p>three-fourths of the earth’s surface, and has a vol- </p><p>ume of three hundred and fifteen million cubic </p><p>miles—began to be exploited on a gigantic scale. </p><p>And Schirmanhever’s prestige and power increased </p><p>until he was virtually dictator of world affairs. </p><p>We were told of the many deaths resulting from </p><p>attempts to discover the secret of his chemical mag- </p><p>net—how the Neptune, the largest vessel in the </p><p>Magnet Fleet, tampered with by engineers seeking </p><p>to uncover the mystery of its vital operations, blew </p><p>up in dock at Hoboken, killing a hundred men and </p><p>wrecking the nearby piers. </p><p>ALL this, I say, has become history. Let me </p><p>come then, without further delay, to that </p><p>final and fatal period of Schirmanhever’s career in </p><p>which I was again destined to have a share. </p><p>Throughout the years of his success our meetings </p><p>had been few, but we kept in touch'with each other. </p><p>When I had at last seen his name in the papers </p><p>after that long interval of silence, I met Schirman- </p><p>hever in New York City; he told me very briefly </p><p>how busy he had been commercializing his process, </p><p>and sketched some of his future plans. Later we </p><p>met again in New York sevei'al times, also in Lon- </p><p>don, Paris and Berlin. Needless to say, every min- </p><p>ute of Schirmanhever’s time during these years</p><p>was priceless; his waiting rooms were thronged </p><p>with financiers, scientists, and reporters requesting </p><p>an interview; but I had only to give my name in </p><p>order to be admitted immediately. There was a </p><p>look of genuine pleasure on his face as, putting </p><p>aside for the time being the enormous weight of </p><p>business resting on his shoulders, he rose to greet </p><p>me; with the world at his feet he seemed to regret </p><p>his past obscurity, to long to be able to return to </p><p>it. Once, glancing at me strangely, his eyes flash- </p><p>ing their old excitement, he started to make some </p><p>suggestion, but after a few words broke off to a </p><p>mutter, "No, I’m not quite ready yet—I must wait </p><p>a little longer!” Then one day I received that mem- </p><p>orable telegram requesting me to come immediately </p><p>to San Francisco. And a week later I was on </p><p>Schirmanhever’s yacht with him bound for that </p><p>lovely little island in the Pacific which fate had </p><p>decreed only one of us should ever leave alive. </p><p> Arrived at the island, an exquisite pearl of trop-</p><p>ical beauty, with great feathery palms swaying </p><p>high in the sky over a white beach terminating in </p><p>a coral reef, where the surf thundered night and </p><p>day, the yacht was dismissed, the captain receiv- </p><p>ing orders to proceed to Honolulu. A date, sev- </p><p>eral months distant, was set for the yacht’s return </p><p>to the island. A comfortable bungalow, well </p><p>stocked with provisions, had been built on the </p><p>island, but Schirmanhever and myself were the only </p><p>inhabitants. Anchored off the island was a float- </p><p>ing laboratory, in general design like a miniature </p><p>vessel of the Magnet Fleet, which Schirmanhever </p><p>inspected on the first day of our arrival. </p><p> That he had come to this remote spot to push</p><p>his investigations into some mysterious realm of </p><p>science, which even his genius had not yet ex- </p><p>plored, was known to me by now. But the exact </p><p>nature of this research he had not told me. I </p><p>could only guess from his suppressed excitement </p><p>during the cruise that he considered all his previ- </p><p>ous discoveries of negligible importance compared </p><p>with those he was now about to attempt. Once </p><p>settled or the island, he was soon spending all his </p><p>hours in the floating laboratory. At the beginning </p><p>I was allowed to come aboard with him, but a day </p><p>came when he put a stop to my visits. It was </p><p>about this time that Schirmanhever, while we sat </p><p>together on the veranda of the bungalow, gave me </p><p>my first cue to the problem he was working on. </p><p> After briefly recapitulating his past accomplish-</p><p>ments—the invention of the first chemical magnet </p><p>that indiscriminately drew all salts out of solution, </p><p>later the perfection of the process to leave in solu- </p><p>tion the sodium chloride of little value, and only</p><p>draw out the more precious potassium, iron, cop- </p><p>per, aluminum, nickel, lead, barium, manganese, </p><p>silver and gold salts, the iodine compounds, phos- </p><p>phates, and radioactive minerals, and these not in </p><p>a mixed mass, but each chemical pulled separately </p><p>out of solution by its own individual magnet, in a </p><p>pure state—he came to his latest idea, that of de- </p><p>veloping a chemical magnet of super-strength, </p><p>which would be capable of dragging out of sea- </p><p>water hitherto unknown chemicals—chemicals of </p><p>which the ocean held only such an infinitesimal </p><p>trace that no ordinary method of analysis could de- </p><p>tect them. </p><p> “Chemicals," said Schirmanhever, "which may</p><p>be tremendously more powerful and mysterious </p><p>than the radioactive minerals, and which may be </p><p>possessed of amazingly new and vital properties^ </p><p>which may, who knows, have actually led to the </p><p>origin of-” </p><p> He broke off. At the time I did not grasp the</p><p>true meaning of what he said. I only had a vague </p><p>but distinct sense of danger. Perhaps it was the </p><p>warmth of the tropic night, and Schirmanhever’s </p><p>glowing eyes close to mine, the black outlines </p><p>against the starlit sky of those tall palms rem- </p><p>492 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>iniscent of days when the whole of the earth was </p><p>a vast fecund jungle. </p><p> “Won’t there be a risk in such experiments?” I</p><p>asked. “If such chemicals do exist, and you collect </p><p>them in any quantity, mayn’t they have a frightful </p><p>effect on the human body?” </p><p> "Very likely,” answered Schirmanhever, but the</p><p>excitement in his voice proved how little he cared. </p><p>He added, “There’s always a risk in the Unknown.” </p><p>From now on he grew pale with a dreadful pal- </p><p>lor. He lost his appetite. He had trembling fits </p><p>that made me fear he had caught some tropical </p><p>fever. I saw him emerge at intervals from the </p><p>interior of the floating laboratory waving his arms </p><p>before him as though to push back an insufferable </p><p>heat. He paced the white beach, muttering to him- </p><p>self, and gesticulating. One day he shouted: </p><p> “I’ve found it at last—the^Secret of Life! I’ve</p><p>got the thing that first brought Life into exist- </p><p>ence! I’ve got it there, out there!" He pointed to </p><p>the floating laboratory. "That much of it!” He </p><p>cupped his hands. “And before I’m through I’ll </p><p>have this much of it!” He threw out his arms in </p><p>a wild gesture that seemed to embrace the entire </p><p>horizon. </p><p> A thrill of horror shot through me. Suddenly I</p><p>realized the truth of why Schirmanhever was wast- </p><p>ing away—remembered my casual suggestion of </p><p>that night, forgotten next morning. Something </p><p>deadlier than poison was devouring him. I seized </p><p>his arm, tried to prevent him from going out to </p><p>the boat again. Schirmanhevet- fought himself </p><p>loose, and the expression in his eyes as he leaped </p><p>away told me he was mad, utterly mad. </p><p>THE next week was a nightmare. Schirman- </p><p>hever, with the cunning of madness, slept on </p><p>the boat now, fearing I would detain him if he re- </p><p>turned to the bungalow. But he came on shore </p><p>stealthily and in the moonlight I saw him several </p><p>times pacing the beach, tottering along in a queer </p><p>way like a drunken man. At last I could stand it </p><p>no longer. I resolved, even at risk of my own life, </p><p>to make a trip to the floating laboratory, find out </p><p>what he was doing there, and bring him forcibly </p><p>back to shore. </p><p> I set out one evening in the dusk. As I put foot</p><p>on the deck of the boat, Schirmanhever emerged </p><p>from a hatchway. He was gasping, his eyes were </p><p>maniacal, but at sight of me he seemed to pull him- </p><p>self together. With a convulsive effort he put his </p><p>hands to his head, and in that instant I believe he </p><p>realized he was dying. Turning, he staggered back </p><p>down the steps into the interior of the vessel, did </p><p>something to the machinery, then appeared on deck </p><p>again holding a large platinum dish containing a </p><p>curious salt that glowed with a pale sea-green </p><p>phosphorescence. I had one glimpse of this strange </p><p>substance, then Schirmanhever had flung the dish </p><p>into the ocean, which swallowed it with a slight </p><p>hiss. In one final moment of sanity Schirmanhever </p><p>grasped my hand, cried hoarsely, “Go! Don’t wait </p><p>a minute! Get back to the shore right away, be- </p><p>cause this”—his nerveless fingers slipped away </p><p>from mine, to indicate the boat we were standing </p><p>on—“won’t be here more than a few seconds.” Then </p><p>he collapsed on the deck, dead. </p><p> An uncontrollable panic seized me in the face</p><p>of that prostrate body, that dreadful, ominous </p><p>silence by which I was surrounded, and springing </p><p>back into the skiff, I rowed madly for shore. </p><p>Scarcely was my foot on land than there was a roar </p><p>behind me, and the floating laboratory split apart </p><p>into burning fragments, which an instant later was </p><p>swallowed by the water. After more than a month </p><p>of frightful solitude, the yacht returned and car- </p><p>ried me back to America. Subsequent develop- </p><p>ment are known to all—how, one by one, Schir- </p><p>manhever’s plants ceased to function, as though in </p><p>the chemical magnets there were some vital ele- </p><p>ment. corresponding to an electric battery, which </p><p>needed renewal after a certain number of years, </p><p>and the secret of restoring this energy had been </p><p>known only to him. Frantic endeavors are still be- </p><p>ing made to rediscover Schirmanhever’s secrets, in </p><p>order once again to infuse vitality into that great </p><p>ocean industry which now lies idle. And—most in- </p><p>teresting of all to me are the many speculations in- </p><p>dulged in by scientists upon the nature of those </p><p>mysterious elements which caused Schirmanhever’s </p><p>terrible end, until today it is generally recognized </p><p>that Schirmanhever actually did manage to extract </p><p>from the ocean water in an appreciable quantity— </p><p>it was that greenish phosphorescent substance in </p><p>the platinum dish, undoubtedly—certain rare but </p><p>exceedingly complex and powerful chemicals </p><p>which, millions of years ago, when the earth was </p><p>all ocean, first brought life into being. </p><p>The End. </p><p>The Master Mind of Mars </p><p>By EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS </p><p>A New Story by the Master of Scientifiction</p><p>also </p><p>The Face in the Abyss </p><p>By A.

Well, no matter. </p><p>Here I was walking by </p><p>Hicks’ side and listening </p><p>to his conversation, bound </p><p>for his home to inspect </p><p>another one of his auto- </p><p>matic inventions. I was </p><p>even offering him one of </p><p>my best cigars! </p><p>"The reason I came to </p><p>see you first,” Hicks was </p><p>saying, “is because I know </p><p>you are capable of judg- </p><p>ing a thing objectively.</p><p>Few people can.

Yet the dining table is being put on the </p><p>market now. We have a company organized and </p><p>will soon have our factory equipped. Accidents will </p><p>happen with any invention when it is being tried </p><p>out. Think what the automobile was like twenty </p><p>years ago! But I can’t convince that crowd, and </p><p>unfortunately they are my best friends,—or at least </p><p>they were once.” </p><p> So Hicks’ talk went on, and by the time we had</p><p>arrived at his house 1 had promised him to </p><p>straighten everything out for him with his relatives </p><p>and friends and to persuade them all to come and </p><p>inspect his new invention, though I had not as yet </p><p>seen it myself. Perhaps that will give you some </p><p>idea of Hicks’ powers of conversation. But here </p><p>we were at his house, a three-story affair of many </p><p>rooms. We climbed the stairs and presently we </p><p>found ourselves in a living room of moderate di- </p><p>mensions, pleasantly decorated and neatly and ele- </p><p>gantly furnished. </p><p> “Looks like an ordinary living room, eh?” asked</p><p>Hicks. </p><p> “Like a more than ordinarily pleasant one, I</p><p>should say,” I replied, allowing myself to slip into </p><p>one of the several overstuffed chairs. </p><p> “And yet, O'Keefe, this room is as unlike an</p><p>ordinary room as a hen’s egg is unlike a golf ball,” </p><p>said Hicks. “This is room Number One in my </p><p>Fully Automatic Apartment.” </p><p> “And how does this room Number One in your</p><p>Fully Automatic Apartment,” I said in jocular </p><p>tone, “differ from any other? Surely you are not </p><p>trying to kid me into believing that there is any- </p><p>thing unusual about it?” </p><p> “No, I am not trying to kid you,” Hicks replied</p><p>with rising dignity. “I merely state a fact when </p><p>I say it is different. And that difference consists </p><p>in the circumstance that this room is self-cleaning, </p><p>self-sweeping, self-arranging. Possibly it has </p><p>escaped the notice of your astute mind,” he con- </p><p>tinued in a tone slightly tinged with irony, “that </p><p>there is a push button board near this door.” With </p><p>this he indicated a small board neatly done in scin- </p><p>tillating glass and with a row of mother-of-pearl </p><p>push buttons disposed on it. “Possibly also,” Hicks </p><p>went on, “you have not noticed several other</p><p>peculiarities. But I will now let action show, not </p><p>words,” and rising, he pressed one of the buttons </p><p>on the switchboard. </p><p>IMAGINE my surprise when the chair in which </p><p>I sat, together with a large rocker near me and </p><p>the table upon which I had just deposited my hat, </p><p>suddenly began to move, and in another second had </p><p>traveled half way across the room,’all in the same </p><p>direction, leaving a swath several yards wide </p><p>lengthwise of the room free and clean of all furni- </p><p>ture. Before I had time to recover, another sur- </p><p>prise topped this one. At the end of the room a </p><p>low grating such as commonly covers the register </p><p>for hot-air systems suddenly swung open and there </p><p>emerged what for a brief, startled moment I men- </p><p>tally put down as a fierce animal with a bushy tail, </p><p>but in which a second later I recognized a suction </p><p>sweeper with bag attached. This sweeper evi- </p><p>dently had a mind of its own, besides considerable </p><p>speed, because without any visible help, it hastily </p><p>proceeded along the wall in a straight line and, ar- </p><p>rived at the opposite end of the long room, moved </p><p>sideways by its own width and retraced its way, </p><p>keeping in a strictly straight line. Before my be- </p><p>wildered gaze, this mechanical animal came and </p><p>went along the floor until it nearly grazed the </p><p>chairs. I was just about to stutter a few words of </p><p>bewilderment when the machine, arrived at its </p><p>starting point, suddenly halted. There was a click </p><p>and a purr, and the entire mass of furniture£~Viow </p><p>crowded to one side of the room, started to rnove, </p><p>my chair carrying me along; and lo! in a jiffy it </p><p>all was lined up along that side of the room which </p><p>had just been swept. </p><p> “How does it strike you, old man?” The voice</p><p>of the inventor seemed to come from afar, so dazed </p><p>was I. </p><p> “Well, I’ll be dashed,” was all I managed to stut-</p><p>ter as I wiped the sweat off my forehead. And </p><p>again that diabolically clever, superhuman-minded </p><p>carpet sweeper started on its methodical way, nor </p><p>did it stop until it had completed its work and every </p><p>inch in the room had been gone over. As it neared </p><p>the wall, another door, similar to the one from </p><p>which it had appeared, swung open, the machine </p><p>entered, and with a click both doors swung shut. </p><p>At once there was another movement among the </p><p>furniture, and those pieces which had last moved </p><p>out of the way returned to their original position, </p><p>until the entire room was again neatly arranged. </p><p> The inventor struck a match and lit a cigarette</p><p>while I wiped the perspiration off my face. “Well?” </p><p>he inquired casually, between two puffs of his</p><p>cigarette. </p><p> My voice came back to me. “Hicks,” I said, “I</p><p>don’t know what to tell you. You have handed me </p><p>the surprise of my life. When you mentioned that </p><p>automatic apartment, . . .” </p><p> “Calm yourself, my boy,” placidly stated Hicks.</p><p>“I have just demonstrated to you the Automatic </p><p>Carpet Sweeper and the Self-Arranging Furniture </p><p>—just one feature of my Automatic Apartment. </p><p>Tell you the secret, too—electro magnetism, heavy </p><p>iron plates are attached low down under the furni- </p><p>ture—you will note the furniture is all somewhat </p><p>low. A system of electro magnets is arranged in </p><p>rows under the flooring. When I push the button, </p><p>the first thing that happens is that one row after </p><p>another of the electro magnetic poles becomes mag- </p><p>netized and then demagnetized, thus moving the </p><p>furniture along. The suction sweeper is furnished </p><p>with power of its own, but also kept true to its path </p><p>by remagnetization of row after row of the same </p><p>magnetic field. But I will now show you some </p><p>things which are really remarkable. Let us pro- </p><p>ceed to the kitchen.” And thither he led the way, </p><p>while I followed, trying to brace myself for the </p><p>next surprise. We entered the kitchen, which was </p><p>spacious and beautifully arranged, with cheerful </p><p>colors decorating the walls and ceiling. </p><p> I looked around me. Everything was there that</p><p>should be found in a well appointed kitchen. The </p><p>sink was of porcelain, but I could see at once that </p><p>there was more to it than just a sink. My ques- </p><p>HICKS’ INVENTIONS WITH A KICK </p><p>495 </p><p>tioning glance was interrupted by Hicks’ watch- </p><p>ful eye. </p><p> “An Automatic Dish-Washing Device, of course,"</p><p>he explained. “But more than that: an Automatic </p><p>Dish Conveyor. Anything set down on this end- </p><p>less belt is immediately conveyed into the dish </p><p>washer, washed, dried and carried out, and depos- </p><p>ited at the opposite end.” </p><p> He placed several cups, saucers, knives and forks</p><p>and a couple of large pans on what looked like a </p><p>white-enameled mat. Above the sink was a push </p><p>button. He pressed it. Instantly the dishes moved </p><p>at a rapid pace toward a long box-like object upon </p><p>one end of the sink. A rail on the conveyor opened </p><p>a trap door, through which the dishes disappeared, </p><p>when the door closed. I heard the splashing of </p><p>water, which continued for fully a minute. Sud- </p><p>denly the noise ceased, there was a click, and the </p><p>array of dishes reappeared on the other side of the </p><p>box, dry, clean, and shining, and stopped under- </p><p>neath a china-cupboard. </p><p> “I did not so far provide anything to distribute</p><p>the dishes 011 the shelf,” half apologetically said the </p><p>inventor. “But for the present this will have </p><p>to do.” </p><p> “But, Hicks—” I said.</p><p>cctttELL, let us pass on to something interest- </p><p> VV ing,” the inventor, seemingly ignoring my</p><p>interruption, said in a tone of one bored with the </p><p>trivialities of everyday existence. “As I said be- </p><p>fore, this is a Fully Automatic Apartment. That </p><p>means it does its own work. You only do the at- </p><p>tractive part of housekeeping. You do not sweep, </p><p>you do not clean, you wash no dishes, brush no </p><p>cobwebs, scrub no floors, polish no shoes. You </p><p>propose, as it were, and the apartment disposes. </p><p>In developing this invention the central idea was </p><p>that drudgery has 110 place in the scheme of life of </p><p>the modern man or woman. My hope was to be </p><p>able to take that drudgery out of life,—and I be- </p><p>lieve that I may say that I have in a measure suc- </p><p>ceeded. Now . . .” </p><p> “But, Hicks—” I said, in a tone of awe.</p><p> “Now look at this ceiling, for instance,” said</p><p>Hicks, seemingly unaware of my astonishment. </p><p>“To the casual glance it looks like any other ceil- </p><p>ing, only with ornamental features ordinarily lack-</p><p>ing in a kitchen ceiling. In reality the design is </p><p>worked out in tiny perforations, the ceiling ma- </p><p>terial being sheet metal. Above this perforated </p><p>ceiling is an air space connected with a powerful </p><p>suction system. Just a moderate amount of air is </p><p>usually circulating through this system. But if </p><p>I turn this switch”—he did and instantly a sighing </p><p>noise was to be heard—“then a powerful exhaust </p><p>is turned on, and cobwebs, dust, smoke and any- </p><p>thing else in the way of dirt disappears. If I take, </p><p>for instance, this handful of flour and scatter it in </p><p>the air, it does not, as you seemed to fear it would, </p><p>judging by the speed with which you tried to duck, </p><p>settle all over you and spoil your new clothes, but” </p><p>—and he pointed to the cloud of flour rapidly van- </p><p>ishing through the ceiling—“it simply disappears. </p><p>As the ceiling is virtually only a fine mesh, there </p><p>is no place for dust, dirt, or cobwebs to stay, when </p><p>this tremendous suction is turned on.” </p><p> While I was trying to formulate in my mind an</p><p>apology for my rudeness in the morning, Hicks </p><p>went on: </p><p> “Now, following out this idea, what would be</p><p>the way to clean the floor? What, O’Keefe, would </p><p>be the way? </p><p> “Well, what would be more natural than to have</p><p>the floor also perforated, but instead of washing </p><p>it, as it were, by air, to wash it with water?” </p><p>queried Hicks, answering his own question. I had </p><p>to admit that he had me there. “Well, anyway,” </p><p>he continued, “that is the way I reasoned and so </p><p>you will note something which probably escaped </p><p>your eye when you entered, and that is that the floor </p><p>is also full of small perforations worked out in a </p><p>pleasing design. This floor, too, is of metal, and </p><p>below it there is a flat tank which can at will be </p><p>filled with water and emptied. If I press this but- </p><p>ton the water will rise. Step on one of these mats </p><p>and watch.” Here he pointed out one of three or </p><p>four cork mats such as are sometimes used in bath- </p><p>rooms, about an inch or so high. We stepped up </p><p>on one, and already we saw the water rising in </p><p>a thousand tiny fountains, each one about a half </p><p>inch high, until the whole floor was submerged </p><p>under a quarter inch of water. “We do not need </p><p>to push any button again to make the water go </p><p>down,” Hicks continued, “but, as you see, it is now </p><p>disappearing, carrying with it dirt, dust, and dis- </p><p>ease germs. The floor is now,” he went on in a </p><p>tone of a lecturer explaining some wonder of na- </p><p>ture, “still wet, but by pushing this button I re- </p><p>verse the process you saw a minute ago, and air, </p><p>and this time warm, dry air, is forced through the </p><p>ceiling from above, passing through the floor below </p><p>in the wake of the water of which the last is now</p><p>running down the drain, which can accommodate </p><p>a cubic foot of water a second, just as also the sup- </p><p>ply pipe is unusually large, permitting a flow of a </p><p>cubic foot every two seconds under the normal </p><p>pressure of 110 pounds per cubic inch prevailing </p><p>in the water system of this town. As you will note, </p><p>the floor is already dry.” </p><p> I Tooked and saw. I was feeling a little feeble,</p><p>and I remember wondering if I had not had some </p><p>of somebody’s homebrew that morning, for I was </p><p>having a queer feeling in my head. The automatic </p><p>cleaning business was too much for an ordinary </p><p>man. I told Hicks so. </p><p> “I have some other features here which I wanted</p><p>to show you,” said Hicks, “but it is perhaps just </p><p>as well that you see them when the company are </p><p>assembled. You have seen enough, my boy, I think, </p><p>to believe me now when I tell you that I have some- </p><p>thing out of the ordinary, something unique and </p><p>something for which the world will be grateful in </p><p>the years to come when by its means the drudgery </p><p>of housekeeping will have been ended. Now, </p><p>O’Keefe, will you arrange this thing for me with </p><p>my—er, former—friends ?” </p><p> That was a useless question. In the first place,</p><p>I had already promised him, and besides, after </p><p>what I had seen I would have arranged for the </p><p>King of Iceland to come and see it. Why, it was </p><p>wonderful, marvelous, big—to think of such an </p><p>idea. And the way he had it figured out—pressure </p><p>per square inch—cubic feet per second—you know </p><p>496 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>that kind of thing always gets me. I have a lot </p><p>of respect for mathematics and engineering, though </p><p>I know nothing about them. I told him I would </p><p>immediately go and see those friends. </p><p>IT was the following Tuesday that they were all </p><p>assembled. I still had a black eye, received </p><p>when Smith, the first one I tried, threw me out of </p><p>his house, but such was my enthusiasm that I had </p><p>managed to convince even him by ignoring his </p><p>brutal attack, and he was present. So was Hicks’ </p><p>uncle Jeremiah, looking as sour as ever, and my </p><p>aunt Eulalia. There was Irvine and Mrs. Smith </p><p>and there were, besides, Professor Dinker and his </p><p>fianciSe, Miss Peak, a prim person somewhat ad- </p><p>vanced beyond mere youth, with glasses, a pointed </p><p>red nose in a pale face, and opinions of her own. </p><p>And there was Hicks and myself. We had all gone </p><p>through the living room and had seen what I had </p><p>described, and now we were in the kitchen and the </p><p>inventor was talking—as usual. </p><p> “This is something still new to you, my dear</p><p>O’Keefe,” Hicks was saying. “This is the Auto- </p><p>matic Shoe Shining Stand. By pushing this but- </p><p>ton, this trap door drops, revealing, as you will </p><p>note, a foot rest such as is commonly used on shoe </p><p>shiners’ stands, except that this is about a foot </p><p>from the floor. If now, Professor," Hicks said, </p><p>waving his hand toward the man of science, “you </p><p>will be kind enough to place your foot upon this </p><p>rest, you will all see that first this padded arm </p><p>takes hold of it, clamping, as it were, over the in- </p><p>step to hold the foot securely down. You will note </p><p>that the machine works for exactly three minutes </p><p>and then lets go. This works automatically, you </p><p>know, and you will yourselves be able to watch the </p><p>process without my telling you.” </p><p> We watched and we saw a hook-like arm, hinged</p><p>at its back end, describe a semi-circle, almost ca- </p><p>ressingly taking hold of the Professor’s foot and </p><p>gently but firmly holding it down. Next, two </p><p>coarse brushes started to work lengthwise of the </p><p>shoe, removing any dirt there was along the soles </p><p>—if there was any. These brushes were fastened </p><p>to a sort of small truck which ran back and forth </p><p>on a pair of rails straddling the footrest, and when </p><p>they suddenly withdrew, they were followed by two </p><p>black polishing brushes running the same way, with </p><p>a third brush issuing from the side and polishing </p><p>the top of the shoes. They moved at great speed, </p><p>and they worked two or three minutes, when they </p><p>suddenly slid back, the clamp opened, and the Pro- </p><p>fessor’s foot, with shoe polished to mirror-shine,</p><p>was released. Everybody murmured his astonish- </p><p>ment. </p><p> “How ever do those brushes get any blacking?”</p><p>asked the practical Mrs. Smith. </p><p> “A very natural question, Madam, and one</p><p>which is very pertinent,” responded the inventor. </p><p>“The solution is as simple as it is efficient. In </p><p>passing out, each brush must pass over a roll upon </p><p>which blacking is distributed by another roll in </p><p>very much the same way that the ink is distributed </p><p>in a printing press. So that part of the inven- </p><p>tion,” he added modestly, “cannot be termed my </p><p>own.” </p><p> “I think it’s marvelous,” Mrs. Smith replied.</p><p>“To think of all those things that you have shown </p><p>us this morning. You call this an invention—why </p><p>it’s dozens of inventions. Oh, wouldn’t I love to </p><p>live in this apartment!” she said. </p><p> “Well, now,” interposed Irvine, “do you think,</p><p>Hicks, that all that machinery is going to work? </p><p>Isn’t something apt to go wrong? That thing that </p><p>held the Professor’s foot down, for instance. You </p><p>say it don’t let go for three minutes. But some- </p><p>thing might happen and you might want to get </p><p>away before then, say in three seconds. Supposing </p><p>there was a fire, then what? I am still waiting to </p><p>see the rest of your apartment, but off-hand this </p><p>strikes me as something to be considered." </p><p> People who must take the cheer out of life are</p><p>an abomination to me. I would have liked to have </p><p>told Irvine so. Couldn’t the fellow see how won- </p><p>derful it all was? But I could have saved myself </p><p>the worry, for Hicks had the answer ready. </p><p> “A natural thought, Irvine,” he smiled. “When</p><p>I said that the arm would not let loose under three </p><p>minutes, what I meant was, of course, unless it </p><p>were released before by pressing the release but- </p><p>ton right under the starting button, just as you </p><p>turn an electric light off after it has been turned </p><p>on. Three minutes is merely the time required for </p><p>a perfect shine and to insure the best results. The </p><p>time-limit device is installed but merely as an aid </p><p>to the user, not as its master.” </p><p>IRVINE looked a little abashed at this natural </p><p>explanation. “I may as well state now,” said </p><p>the inventor, “that this time I have left nothing </p><p>out. I built a special device which automatically </p><p>operated the various mechanisms, turning them on </p><p>and off, and reversing them hundreds of times a </p><p>day, to insure that every part worked as it should.</p><p>Also, I operated the various machines at a number </p><p>of speeds. The dish washer, the sweeper, the shoe </p><p>shiner, and all other devices are, in fact, still hooked </p><p>up so that they can be run at up to three times </p><p>their present operating speed, which was chosen </p><p>by me as the ideal because the most efficient. But </p><p>deeds are greater than words and, therefore, let </p><p>us now, after this little sample of work of the Fully </p><p>Automatic Apartment, proceed with a practical </p><p>demonstration of the larger features. Let me turn </p><p>on this switch.” </p><p> He did, and then opened a large box containing</p><p>a powdery substance. “Knowing is believing, and </p><p>to make my demonstration convincing, I have here </p><p>what is called fuller’s earth. It is a light, dusty </p><p>substance, and it could very properly be classed as </p><p>dirt. I have explained the action of the ceiling to </p><p>you. Let us now see what becomes of this earth </p><p>which I shall fling into the air.” With this he </p><p>reached into the box and scattered a handful in </p><p>the air. Everybody dodged and Mrs. Smith </p><p>screamed, while even the prim Miss Peak lost sud- </p><p>denly some of her composure as she saw the thick </p><p>cloud of white dirt starting into the air. But, as </p><p>if by magic, the cloud rose and instantly disap- </p><p>peared through the ceiling. Nobody’s clothes were </p><p>soiled with even a speck of dust. “How is this?” </p><p>smiled the inventor, as he took handful after hand- </p><p>ful of the stuff and flung it above him, the earth </p><p>each time instantly disappearing through the ceil- </p><p>HICKS’ INVENTIONS WITH A KICK </p><p>497 </p><p>ing. "The ceiling, I believe, is doing its work. </p><p>Now let us try the floor. I push this switch, and </p><p>what happens?” </p><p> Instantly there was a sound I did not like. You</p><p>know I have a sort of an instinct for that kind of </p><p>thing; I can sort of feel when something is wrong. </p><p>Something seemed to work with an uncalled-for </p><p>force, for there was a vibrating and gurgling I </p><p>had not heard the last time. Instinctively I looked </p><p>at the inventor, who had grown the color of pale </p><p>cheese and was fumbling with a push button. "The </p><p>wrong one,” I heard him groan. “The wrong one! </p><p>0,	why did I leave that experimental stuff here?”</p><p>And then suddenly there was action. Straight in </p><p>the air, out of a thousand holes, there shot as many </p><p>streams of water, which rose six or seven feet high. </p><p>In an instant everybody was drenched from head </p><p>to foot. All those present were so dumfounded </p><p>that for a few moments nobody moved. In fact, </p><p>this upside downpour was so thick that one could </p><p>hardly look through it. Just then the inventor </p><p>gave a mighty wrench on the switchboard and the </p><p>streams ceased. But there were three inches of </p><p>water on the floor. </p><p> "What in the hotel is the matter?” roared Irvine,</p><p>who was the first to recover his senses. “What is </p><p>the matter, Hicks? Are you trying to drown us?” </p><p> “I accidentally pushed the experimental switch,</p><p>and it refused to kick off. It doesn’t matter. </p><p>I’ll ...” stuttered Hicks. </p><p> "What the devil do you mean, doesn’t matter?”</p><p>bellowed Smith. “Don’t you see that you have </p><p>completely ruined all our clothes? And it doesn’t </p><p>matter! Now of all the . . </p><p> "1 didn’t mean it that way, Smith,” wailed Hicks.</p><p>"I’ll turn on the warm air and we will all be dry </p><p>in a minute.” With feverish hands he fingered the </p><p>switchboard. </p><p> We had all been recovering, and as we recovered</p><p>and everybody looked at himself, drenched from </p><p>head to foot, there was a feeling in the air as of </p><p>a dozen thunderstorms brewing and ready to break. </p><p>Something would have to happen to divert those </p><p>people from dwelling on their troubles, I thought, </p><p>and as I thought, it did. Hicks had found the but- </p><p>ton, and there was a click. </p><p> All at once, I heard a high whine, and instantly</p><p>there was an explosive puff, and the air was white. </p><p>Just before I closed my eyes, I saw why it was white. </p><p>It was the fuller’s earth, a matter of twenty pounds </p><p>or so, returning well distributed from the ceiling </p><p>the same way it had come, with the same force, </p><p>and every bit that had been put in. Instantly our </p><p>wet clothes, for the most part dark-colored, as it </p><p>was winter, from our hats down to our shoes, were </p><p>as if covered with flour. The professor wiped his </p><p>face and smeared a broad streak of it over his nose </p><p>and mouth. It was so funny that I could not help </p><p>laughing. He tried to glare at me, but was cut </p><p>short by a fit of sneezing. Even in the act of laugh- </p><p>ing, I was seized, and in a moment all the others. </p><p>Everybody was sneezing his head off. </p><p> “Hee, kachoo! He, kachoo! Hicks!” screamed</p><p>Smith between spasms, “what, kachoo; in the hell, </p><p>kachoo! are you doing; kachoo, kachoo! Turn the </p><p>blooming, kachoo! thing off! I, kachoo! kachoo!” </p><p>he choked and could not go on. </p><p> “I am ha-ha-ha, kachoo! turning it off; I will</p><p>turn it off, I have turned it off, kachoo! kachoo!” </p><p>coughed the inventor as well as he could, between </p><p>sneezes. “There will be no more of it, kachoo!” </p><p>AFTER a few minutes the dust settled and the </p><p>babel of sneezes ceased. Then a flood of elo- </p><p>quence broke loose. Everybody was telling Hicks </p><p>what he thought of him. In his misery, the un- </p><p>happy inventor turned and started to fool with his </p><p>switchboard. </p><p> “Lead the way out, Hicks, let us go and never</p><p>see you again!” roared Irvine. </p><p> "Dismiss us instantly, sir,” sternly ordered the</p><p>professor, who had managed to regain as much of </p><p>his dignity as was possible with a face like a miller </p><p>and clothes that looked as if they had been through </p><p>the flour mill. </p><p> “The back way is the quickest way out,” said</p><p>the inventor, eager to get rid of his company. He </p><p>jumped ahead toward the back door, the others fol- </p><p>lowing. But it was locked from the outside. “I </p><p>have an electric lock on there,” he muttered, as his </p><p>fingers sought another switchboard,—there were </p><p>switchboards everywhere on the walls, and I had </p><p>been wondering how he kept them apart. I was </p><p>to learn later. The shoe shining machine trap door </p><p>opened out into the room at the exact moment that </p><p>the professor approached with dignified step. Just </p><p>then he slipped on one of the wooden mats and fell, </p><p>landing on his back, with his neck on the footrest </p><p>of the shoe shining machine. I gasped. Instantly, </p><p>the foot clamp swung over, lovingly taking hold of</p><p>the professor’s throat and gently but determinedly </p><p>holding down his head. Before our horrified gaze, </p><p>the stiff revolving brushes appeared as if by magic </p><p>and with a couple dozen swift and vigorous strokes </p><p>prepared the professor’s ears for what was to come. </p><p>As the stiff bristles did their work, his shriek of </p><p>desperation could be heard a mile. The prim Miss </p><p>Peak, forgetting her dignity, came screaming to </p><p>her betrothed’s aid, but was unable to lift the </p><p>clamp. I tried, but it was no use. The roughing </p><p>brushes had by this time finished, and now appeared </p><p>the polishing outfit. Immediately the professor's </p><p>entire face was covered with an even coat of black, </p><p>which the brushes started to rub down to an op- </p><p>tical polish. Even with the full realization of the </p><p>situation, I could not refrain from admiring the </p><p>thoroughness and fantastic speed with which those </p><p>brushes worked. Judging things objectively is a </p><p>habit with me, you know. In a few seconds the </p><p>professor’s nose shone like a super-polished black </p><p>knob, while other parts of his facial anatomy were </p><p>taking on a wonderful shine. Ninety-five strokes a </p><p>minute, the inventor had said. It seemed more like </p><p>five hundred and ninety-five. By George, the high </p><p>experimental speed must be turned on! That was </p><p>it. I remembered. These were just some ideas </p><p>that flashed through my mind—funny how the </p><p>human mind will work in close situations. </p><p> The professor’s struggles helped as little as his</p><p>screams. “Push down your release switch, you </p><p>idiot,” roared Irvine. I could have kicked myself. </p><p>Why didn't I at least think of that simple thing? </p><p>But Hicks stood there, pale as cheese, except for </p><p>the large smears of fuller’s earth on his face, fum- </p><p>(Continued on page 512) </p><p>a bundle of </p><p>. ...

Hence, it was with more than ordinary inter- </p><p>est that he looked at the glaring headlines of the </p><p>New York journals, so much more blatant than </p><p>those employed by the European press. </p><p> One glance at the first page of the newspaper in-</p><p>formed him why Jim Craighead had not met him. </p><p>He shut his eyes for a moment to assure himself </p><p>that he was not dreaming—that he really was home </p><p>and not with the medical celebrities who had gath- </p><p>ered at Vienna. Dismay, horror and unbelief strove </p><p>alternately for mastery. It was impossible—Heaven </p><p>would not permit such a crime. “Craighead in- </p><p>quest perfunctory” read the streamer. “Well-known </p><p>banker dies of shock following operation.” Craig- </p><p>head, it appeared, had slipped while dashing for a </p><p>train. The platform was wet—the train was al- </p><p>ready in motion—he missed his footing, one leg </p><p>going under the wheels. Amputation became neces- </p><p>sary, fatal blood poisoning having set in. </p><p> The inquest had begun that very day. Very</p><p>little testimony had been taken when the edition Dr. </p><p>Jarvis was reading went to press. It was after two </p><p>o’clock in the afternoon when he got into the taxi, </p><p>and the doctor immediately resolved to hear what </p><p>he might of the remainder of the testimony. </p><p>Leaning out the window of the taxi, he called: </p><p>“Drive me to the Coroner’s Court, please.” </p><p> In a few minutes he stood in the court room just</p><p>before the Coroner adjourned the Court for the day. </p><p>The attending physician </p><p>was on the witness stand </p><p>completing his recital of </p><p>the patient’s treatment. </p><p> “Now. Dr. Lawson.”</p><p>asked Mr. Bailey, a law- </p><p>yer representing an in- </p><p>surance company in</p><p>which Craighead held a </p><p>large policy, “how did you </p><p>treat your patient? I </p><p>understand that amputa- </p><p>tion was necessary as soon as Mr. Craighead </p><p>reached the hospital.” </p><p> “That is correct,” replied the doctor.</p><p> "Were all the usual precautions taken?”</p><p> “Oh, yes,” said Doctor Lawson, “I attended to</p><p>that myself. The wound was perfectly sterilized. </p><p>Then I attached the haemostats.” </p><p> “What do you mean by that?” asked Mr. Bailey.</p><p>"Little clips are used to fasten the ends of the </p><p>severed blood vessels. Afterward, they are replaced </p><p>by gut which is tied around the blood vessel, grad- </p><p>ually being absorbed as healing progresses,” replied </p><p>the doctor. </p><p> “And with all these precautions, the shock of</p><p>the operation killed Mr. Craighead?” </p><p> “That is true,” assented Dr. Lawson.</p><p> “That will be all for today,” said Mr. Bailey.</p><p>"Tomorrow, I will want to ask you a few questions.” </p><p> The lawyers folded up their papers preparatory</p><p>to leaving the court room, while the large crowd </p><p>which had gathered out of curiosity to hear how </p><p>one of the wealthiest bankers of the city had met his </p><p>destiny, slowly filed out. Dr. Jarvis, seeing the </p><p>physician of the insurance company, whom he knew </p><p>well, at the table, joined him as he packed a sheaf </p><p>of papers into a wallet. </p><p> “What do you make of it Fulton?” he questioned</p><p>the doctor. </p><p> “So far, we have learned nothing, Jarvis,” said</p><p>Dr. Fulton, slowly. “I know how close you and </p><p>Craighead were. You must feel terribly shocked. </p><p>It seems clear that the operation killed him. There </p><p>is no ground for suspicion, but we must make some </p><p>kind of fight, before we pay a $300,000 policy which </p><p>has been in force only six months. He left a large </p><p>estate too, as you probably know.” </p><p> Dr. Jarvis went home in a deep, brown study.</p><p>He was shocked and horrified by the loss of his </p><p>dearest friend. He could not reconcile the thought </p><p>that this big, hearty person was the victim of blood </p><p>poison or shock. Why, the man had always been </p><p>immune. He had been proverbially tough, bubbling </p><p>oyer with vitality. “How had he lost that immu-</p><p>nity?” he asked himself. He recalled their last </p><p>day together—the day before he had sailed for </p><p>Europe. They were playing tennis at the country </p><p>club. </p><p> Dr. Jarvis, trying desperately to prevent his</p><p>rival from scoring the last point in a hard-fought </p><p>game, swung down viciously on a high bounding </p><p>ball, sending it back low over the net in what looked </p><p>like a volley, impossible to handle. But Jim Craig- </p><p>head whipped his racquet up in a swift lawford and </p><p>the ball, like a shot from a gun, sped down the side </p><p>line far from the doctor’s reach. </p><p> “Damn,” he cried,</p><p>“trimmed 8 to 6 by a man </p><p>of fifty and I’m your </p><p>junior by ten years. But </p><p>you sure do keep in con- </p><p>dition.” </p><p> “Doc,” answered Craig-</p><p>head, “just three months </p><p>ago, when I took out life </p><p>insurance policies for </p><p>$300,000, the examiner </p><p>said he would like to have </p><p>a dozen risks in my condition. I can run a mile at </p><p>a good pace and do any stunts in the gym that a </p><p>kid can do.” </p><p> “That’s right, Doctor Jarvis,” chimed in a young</p><p>man of twenty-two, who, with a beautiful girl about </p><p>the same age, had just run up to the club house in </p><p>Craighead’s sedan, “he made me go some to keep </p><p>ahead of him in a long swim, though he didn’t even </p><p>know the crawl.” </p><p>DOCTOR JARVIS recalled that picture now—the </p><p>great, tawny-haired Craighead towering above </p><p>his adopted son’s head, his arm fondly on his shoul- </p><p>HEN Dr. </p><p>gang plai </p><p>return fr </p><p>Congress </p><p>fully expi </p><p> T-J ERE is a murder detccjive story of a different type,</p><p> which we warmly recommend lo you.

The </p><p>girl, the jewel in the setting, had light hair, neither </p><p>golden nor yellow, although with a touch of autumn </p><p>wheat; she was delicately featured, with an expres- </p><p>sive mouth, inclined to be serious. Now, with these </p><p>two men, apparently happy and smiling, she revealed </p><p>very regular, white teeth. Ross Craighead was al- </p><p>most as tall as his adopted father but slender; Jim </p><p>was wide shouldered and robust. The girl, although </p><p>tall, seemed diminutive beside these two. </p><p> If the beautiful girl and the handsome youth</p><p>seemed well and full of vitality, Jim Craighead was </p><p>almost insolent in his defiant heartiness. Ross </p><p>was the orphaned son of Craighead’s sister who had </p><p>died when he was a few years old. The bond be- </p><p>tween these two was very strong—Ross was a sensi- </p><p>tive soul, of the artistic type, against which char- </p><p>acteristic the buoyant Craighead had waged a losing </p><p>fight. The boy could not be hardened. </p><p> At college he was all for humanities, classics,</p><p>science, logic, but close calculation in business </p><p>seemed to have been left out of his nature. Sports </p><p>had attracted him—he was good material for the </p><p>teams, especially in baseball and swimming. Just </p><p>as Craighead had determined that he would be hope- </p><p>less in the banking and brokerage operations which </p><p>he controlled, Ross had met Tessie Prettyman, who </p><p>was secretary to Craighead’s manager. Her effi- </p><p>ciency was due to the fact that she took every in- </p><p>struction seriously and obeyed implicitly. She be- </p><p>lieved anything she was told, which was incon- </p><p>venient when she was listening to a rival of the firm. </p><p> Craighead was inclined to discourage the inti-</p><p>macy he saw growing between the pair but when </p><p>Ross began to grind earnestly at tasks Jim knew </p><p>the boy loathed, he began to consider the girl less a </p><p>liability than an asset. She was an orphan, that </p><p>was all they knew of her history. But she was well </p><p>educated, a lady in all her actions, so that Jim soon </p><p>grew as fond of her as Ross. This, then, was the </p><p>circle which had been broken up by a tragedy so </p><p>unnecessary in Dr. Jarvis’s mind as to be heart- </p><p>breaking. </p><p> Like all healthy men—men who have never felt</p><p>an ache or a pain, Jim was virtually a baby when </p><p>some slight cut or other wound came in a tennis or </p><p>other game. Once Doctor Jarvis had found him </p><p>taking morphine. Jim had said, rather shame- </p><p>facedly : </p><p> “It’s not a habit, Milt, but I just can’t stand pain.</p><p>I’ve never had much, I guess that’s the reason.” </p><p> This last day he had seen Craighead, the recol-</p><p>lection of which came to the doctor’s mind over and </p><p>over again, the young man had taken the front seat </p><p>with Tessie, while Jim and Doctor Jarvis sat in </p><p>the rear. </p><p> “Jim, old man, I’ll be missing you,” said the doc-</p><p>tor, as they left him at his apartment. </p><p> “We’ll be waiting at the pier when you come back,</p><p>Milt, twice as famous as you are now,” was Jim’s </p><p>reply. </p><p> That was like him. He had helped Doctor Jarvis</p><p>through his ea^ly difficulties and setbacks, encourag- </p><p>ing him and rejoicing in his successes. He was </p><p>foster father and pal in one. So Doctor Jarvis was </p><p>very impatient as his brain refused to accept the </p><p>fact that Jim Craighead was dead. </p><p> In no way could he reconcile his sturdy friend’s</p><p>death with a theory that the shock of an operation </p><p>would kill him. His analysis was searching. Noth- </p><p>ing in his experience was overlooked. He was </p><p>skilled in X-ray therapy as well as X-ray photogra- </p><p>phy. His science was modern—the latest researches </p><p>were commonplaces to him. But facts were what he </p><p>needed, after all. No conclusions could be drawn </p><p>from surmises. This thought drove him to the room </p><p>of Inspector Craven at headquarters. They were </p><p>good friends, for the doctor had often given expert </p><p>testimony in trials in which the inspector was in- </p><p>terested. </p><p> “Inspector,” began Dr. Jarvis, “what do you know</p><p>of this Craighead inquest?” </p><p> “Well, Doc,” replied the inspector, settling his</p><p>huge frame back in a capacious chair, as he wrin- </p><p>kled his thick brows and blew the smoke from a vile </p><p>smelling pipe through his walrus moustache, “in- </p><p>quests are not much in our line unless there is some </p><p>crime involved. This is such a clear case of a man </p><p>dying from the shock of an operation that the police </p><p>have no more interest in it than the public. Of </p><p>course Craighead was a big man. I knew him well </p><p>myself. He used to stop here to pick me up some- </p><p>times, so I got to know what an impatient chap he </p><p>was. He told me that he’d sprint for a car, when- </p><p>ever he had to ride on a street car, like any kid </p><p>of seventeen. The insurance company would grab </p><p>at anything suspicious but nothing has come up. </p><p>We all know the story. Craighead got too cocky </p><p>in his sprinting ability, and was run over. It was </p><p>mucky and rainy, so what followed was almost in- </p><p>evitable. Tough on the insurance companies, though.</p><p>Doc Lawson seems positive that it was the shock of </p><p>the operation.” </p><p> “That is just why I don’t feel satisfied,” said Dr.</p><p>Jarvis. “Lawson is an old practitioner, a good sur- </p><p>geon, but very apt to make up his mind what killed </p><p>his patient. The more you might show him the </p><p>probability of some other cause, the more stubbornly </p><p>he would believe in his own theory.” </p><p> "There are quite a few of us like that, Doc,”</p><p>smiled the inspector. “But, you knew the whole </p><p>family. Is there anyone who could profit by Craig- </p><p>head’s death?” </p><p> “Well, there is Ross, Jim’s adopted son and his</p><p>nephew. But he had all the money he needed—he </p><p>was in the business with Jim. Then, too, Jim made </p><p>no secret of the fact that his fortune was to go to </p><p>Ross. So I think that Ross is out of the question, </p><p>for they were devoted to each other. Ross is the </p><p>idealistic type—he would be more apt to give money </p><p>away than try to get it by murder.” </p><p> “Who else is there?” queried the inspector, indif-</p><p>ferently, for he could see no mystery in Craighead’s </p><p>death. </p><p> "Then,” continued the doctor, “there is the girl to</p><p>whom Ross is engaged, a perfectly innocent creature </p><p>who simply adored Jim—he treated her as if she </p><p>were already his daughter-in-law. She is an or- </p><p>phan, Tessie Prettyman.” </p><p> “Tessie Prettyman!” exploded Inspector Craven,</p><p>“Good Lord, Doctor Jarvis, do you know who Tessie </p><p>Prettyman is?” </p><p> “No, she has no family that we know of, but she</p><p>seems to be a very refined and charming little lady.” </p><p>THE SHADOW ON THE SPARK </p><p>501 </p><p>tc\T rELL,” said the inspector, bouncing from his </p><p>VV chair, “Tessie Prettyman is a girl who has </p><p>been visiting Piggy Bill Hovey down in the Tombs. </p><p>Piggy Bill is held on a narcotic charge, without bail, </p><p>because he was caught with a large supply of mor- </p><p>phine, opium and heroin; the Federal boys want </p><p>to find out where he gets that stuff because he can’t </p><p>be connected with any smuggling operations. Our </p><p>men have watched the girl and she seems to know </p><p>Piggy Bill very well. Some of them think she is his </p><p>sweetie. But if Piggy Bill is anywhere on the hor- </p><p>izon, I am willing to be suspicious about Craighead’s </p><p>death." </p><p> This revelation grated on Dr. Jarvis. He did not</p><p>believe for a moment that this sweet looking girl </p><p>had any criminal tendencies or was capable of play- </p><p>ing such a dual r61e as the affianced of Ross Craig- </p><p>head and the “sweetie” of a notorious criminal. </p><p> “Inspector,” he said finally, “have you time to go</p><p>up to the hospital with me? The records or the </p><p>head nurse might tell us something.” </p><p> “Time, time,” roared Craven, “this is official busi-</p><p>ness now. What we have to learn is how Piggy </p><p>Bill's sweetie happens to be engaged to marry Jim </p><p>Craighead’s son. First thing, we’ll go to the hos- </p><p>pital, then we’ll talk with this young man who seems </p><p>to be infatuated with Tessie.” </p><p> In the inspector's big car it was a short trip to</p><p>the hospital. The records told them nothing new. </p><p>It was Dr. Lawson’s case, so that whatever he might </p><p>have to say would be developed at the inquest. But </p><p>for the fact, suddenly unveiled, that Piggy Bill was </p><p>somewhere in this series of events, the inspector </p><p>would have remained seated in his big chair, se- </p><p>renely puffing on his pipe. </p><p> “Doc,” said the inspector, suddenly, “let’s talk to</p><p>the head nurse first, then we can look up the young </p><p>man and Tessie.” </p><p> “Miss Cornhill,” asked the Doctor, when the head</p><p>nurse appeared, “did you see Mr. Craighead when </p><p>he was brought into the hospital a few days ago?” </p><p>“Of course,” replied the nurse. </p><p> “How did Mr. Craighead seem to you?” he queried</p><p>further. </p><p> “Doctor Jarvis,” the nurse said, “Mr. Craighead</p><p>was very badly hurt. He was not a patient sufferer </p><p>—he stood the pain irritably and was relieved when</p><p>it became necessary to etherize him. He asked the </p><p>doctor to give him a hypodermic a couple of times, </p><p>but the doctor refused." </p><p> “That was like Jim.” murmured Doctor Jarvis.</p><p>“But,” continued the nurse, “he should not have </p><p>died from the operation under normal conditions. </p><p>Of course his mental condition was very bad. He </p><p>was a very handsome man, in fine physical condi- </p><p>tion and he moaned, time after time, “I had as lief </p><p>been killed as lose my foot.” </p><p> “When Mr. Craighead was taken home, Miss</p><p>Cornhill,” asked the doctor, “did one of your nurses </p><p>accompany him?” </p><p> “No, sir,” was the reply, “Mr. Craighead insisted</p><p>that his son and the young man’s lady friend be </p><p>with him—anyone else, he was sure, would irritate </p><p>him more than help.” </p><p> “Thank you, very kindly, Miss Cornhill,” said the</p><p>Doctor, and they left the hospital. </p><p> “Well, inspector,” began Doctor Jarvis, when they</p><p>were seated in' the car, “we didn’t get very far at </p><p>the hospital. If it lies between Ross and Tessie, I </p><p>guess it may as well end where it is.” </p><p> "See here, Doc,” said the inspector, gripping Doc-</p><p>tor Jarvis by the arm, “you’ve started me looking </p><p>for a murder or some crime and by the eternal, you </p><p>are not going to let any sentimentality about a </p><p>pretty girl check our investigation until we know </p><p>that there is or is not a crime.” </p><p> “Inspector,” replied the Doctor, with a hard glint</p><p>in his eye, “as long as there is any &lt;’ ubt as to how </p><p>Jim died, I am with you to the end. 1 simply meant </p><p>to express my opinion that neither of those two </p><p>could be involved. Let us look the situation in the </p><p>face. Dr. Lawson has certified that Jim Craighead </p><p>died of natural causes. That prevents any kind of </p><p>action until the inquest reveals something of a sus- </p><p>picious nature. In fact, there would have been no </p><p>inquest but for the insistence of the insurance com- </p><p>pany. Now, we must develop something that points </p><p>to some unnatural factor in Jim's death before the </p><p>inquest is over.” </p><p> “That’s true enough,” replied Craven, “and we</p><p>don’t want to alarm anyone until we have the goods </p><p>on him. You be at the inquest bright and early </p><p>and keep your eyes and ears wide open. I will find </p><p>out when Tessie went to see Piggy Bill last and </p><p>join you later.” </p><p> The inspector left Doctor Jarvis at his door, a</p><p>prey to many conflicting emotions. He had started </p><p>machinery going which he knew could no longer be </p><p>stopped. But he did not want to leave Ross open </p><p>to an insidious attack. His efforts to communicate </p><p>with him, however, were unavailing. After a </p><p>sleepless night the doctor refreshed himself with </p><p>a plunge, a shave, and then having dressed himself </p><p>in a sombre garb which fitted well with his present </p><p>emotions, went to the Coroner’s court. It had just </p><p>opened with Dr. Lawson on the stand. </p><p> “Now Doctor,” began Mr. Bailey, representing the</p><p>insurance company, “you were describing, yester- </p><p>day, the nature of Mr. Craighead’s injuries. You </p><p>mentioned fastening the haemostats yourself. Will </p><p>you tell the coroner and the jury what you mean </p><p>by that?” </p><p> “Why, yes,” answered Dr. Lawson, “to use layman</p><p>language, haemostats are little clips which are ap- </p><p>plied to the ends of all the severed blood vessels </p><p>when we amputate, thus closing them so tightly </p><p>that no foreign or toxic substances can find ftoeir </p><p>way in.” </p><p> Dr. Jarvis leaned over to the physician of the</p><p>insurance company whispering, “Fulton, why </p><p>doesn’t your lawyer ask him how the shock of the </p><p>operation or blood poison could kill him, if the </p><p>haemostats were properly applied?” </p><p> Dr. Fulton communicated this message to the</p><p>lawyer who immediately shot this question at Dr. </p><p>I.awson. </p><p> “Dr. Lawson, if the haemostats were properly</p><p>applied, how do you suppose the poisonous sub- </p><p>stances got into the wound, if the wound was sterile, </p><p>as we must assume it to have been after the opera- </p><p>tion at the hospital?” </p><p> “Well, one way, which I assume to have been the</p><p>true way, is that the poisons made their way </p><p>through the wall cells of the blood vessels—the ar- </p><p>502 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>teries, veins and capillaries,” replied Dr. Lawson. </p><p> At this reply, Dr. Jarvis shut his lips very grimly.</p><p>He was making progress at last. Very opportunely, </p><p>at this moment, Inspector Craven slipped into the </p><p>chair next to him. </p><p> “Doc,” he murmured, in a low tone, “we are on the</p><p>track of something—Tessie visited Piggy Bill twice, </p><p>the day before Craighead died. He’s a bad egg, </p><p>but we never have caught him in anything red </p><p>handed except this narcotic deal. He’s bad, though, </p><p>bad enough for anything. Now, here’s another </p><p>funny thing about Piggy. He’s an educated rogue, </p><p>talks French and is a great student of toxicology. </p><p>How does that fit in with your story now?" </p><p> “Inspector,” said the doctor, "I don't know yet</p><p>where we are heading, but that last remark of Doc- </p><p>tor Lawson’s shows me that Jim did not die of the </p><p>causes ascribed. Now we must find out what did </p><p>cause his death. With a few more facts, I think I </p><p>can clear this mystery. I’m half tempted to take a </p><p>hand right now.” </p><p> “Wait until you have the whole story,” advised</p><p>the inspector. “If we have to make any arrests, we </p><p>don’t want to warn them in advance.” </p><p> "Doctor Lawson has just made a bad break," said</p><p>Dr. Jarvis, “which makes it easy to show him up, </p><p>although I hate to discredit him. He really is a </p><p>good surgeon, but he’s not modern enough. We </p><p>must get all the information we can from him before </p><p>he suspects we are after anything.” </p><p> He then scribbled on a piece of paper, “Ask who</p><p>nursed Craighead.” </p><p> In a few seconds the lawyer asked:</p><p> “Dr. Lawson, Mr. Craighead was in charge of a</p><p>nurse, of course?” </p><p> “He was in good hands, Mr. Bailey,” said Dr.</p><p>Lawson; “it was his own wish that his son Ross and </p><p>Miss Tessie Prettyman, of whom he seemed to be </p><p>very fond, should be with him and administer his </p><p>medicine.” </p><p> "Is Miss Prettyman here?" queried the lawyer.</p><p> “She is sitting just back of you.”</p><p> “That will be all for the present, thank you, doc-</p><p>tor,” concluded Mr. Bailey.</p><p>« WISS PRETTYMAN, will you take the stand?” </p><p> -I asked tho coroner.</p><p> Both Dr. Jarvis and the inspector looked keenly at</p><p>the girlish figure which mounted to the witness box. </p><p>She was tall, well formed, with a wealth of blond </p><p>hair which surrounded a very beautiful, expressive </p><p>face, now drawn with worry and late vigils. </p><p> “You nursed Mr. Craighead during his last illness,</p><p>did you not, Miss Prettyman?” asked the lawyer, </p><p>after the usual preliminaries were over. </p><p> “Ross and I took turns, and sometimes both of us</p><p>sat with him together,” said the girl. “He grew </p><p>fretful when one or the other of us was away for </p><p>even a minute.” </p><p> “Did you give him his medicines?” continued the</p><p>lawyer. </p><p> "Sometimes I did and sometimes it was Ross,”</p><p>said the girl in a low voice, in which a slight catch </p><p>of emotion was discernible. </p><p> “Gad, Doc,” snapped the inspector, “where is this</p><p>young chap? If he knows anything we can sweat </p><p>both him and Tessie.” </p><p> “There he is, three seats over,” replied Dr. Jarvis.</p><p>“One look at him ought to satisfy you.” </p><p> They looked at the tall, well dressed youth—</p><p>about twenty-two he was—a sincere, dreamy looking </p><p>chap, yet now with his lips tightly compressed, evi- </p><p>dently resentful of the way the girl he loved was </p><p>being prodded. </p><p> "Miss Prettyman,” queried the lawyer, who as yet</p><p>had not caught the drift of Dr. Jarvis’s prompting, </p><p>“how did Mr. Craighead die? Describe his symp- </p><p>toms.” </p><p> “I can hardly tell you that,” answered the girl</p><p>without hesitation. “Ross would lie down for awhile </p><p>in the adjoining room, with the door open, when- </p><p>ever Mr. Craighead dozed ofT late at night. Mr. </p><p>Craighead died very suddenly, for I ran in a very </p><p>few seconds after Ross had cried that he was in </p><p>danger. Ross, of course, saw him die but would </p><p>tell me nothing about it. He said it was too awful.” </p><p> “Now is the time, Doc,” said the inspector, all his</p><p>detective instincts aroused. “We’ll see what the </p><p>boy says and then, if it throws suspicion on him, we </p><p>can see how deep is the affection of Piggy Bill’s </p><p>sweetie.”</p><p> In the girl, the inspector, looking for important</p><p>revelations, saw now, not a pretty girl, but the pos- </p><p>sible accomplice of Piggy Bill Hovey in some foul </p><p>deed. </p><p> “Swear Ross Craighead,” said the coroner, who</p><p>did not know whether he was to be bored with a lot </p><p>of insurance statistics or was to face a drama not </p><p>yet unfolded. </p><p> The buzz of conversation in the courtroom ceased</p><p>as Ross took the stand. No one knew in what direc- </p><p>tion the inquest was tending. Even to the coroner </p><p>this long rehearsal of symptoms without any avowed </p><p>purpose seemed unnecessarily delayed. Inspector </p><p>Craven’s presence puzzled him. He did not espe- </p><p>cially relish having the police oversee his conduct </p><p>of an inquest. He asked rather curtly that the </p><p>proceedings be hastened. </p><p> “Mr. Craighead,” began the lawyer, “were you</p><p>with your father in his last hours?” </p><p> “I was,” answered Ross, sadly.</p><p> “Did you purchase the medicines administered</p><p>to him?” </p><p> “No, sir,” was the reply. “He was very querulous</p><p>if I left his side. When I dozed off, he often called </p><p>me just to talk. He felt the loss of his activity so </p><p>much it was pitiful. Miss Prettyman, who loved </p><p>him almost as much as I did, for we were always </p><p>together, never minded going out for whatever he </p><p>wanted, day or night.” </p><p> "I should say not,” muttered the inspector grimly</p><p>to Doctor Jarvis. </p><p> “Now,” pursued the lawyer, obedient to the doc-</p><p>tor’s prompting, “how did your father die? I do </p><p>not want to deepen your pain, but we must get at </p><p>some understanding of the exact cause of your </p><p>father’s death.” </p><p> “Well,” answered Ross, wearily, “he insisted on</p><p>taking opiates; he knew how to take a hypodermic , </p><p>himself, but he took some other drug, heroin, per- </p><p>haps. He was not a drug addict, but he often said </p><p>that he would take anything to drown pain. It </p><p>happened like a flash. I did not know that blood </p><p>poison could travel so fast. The night he died he </p><p>THE SHADOW ON THE SPARK </p><p>503 </p><p>took an opiate and seemed drowsy, so that I said I </p><p>would lie down for a moment or two. He took a </p><p>bottle in which was a colorless liquid and poui'ed </p><p>some of it into a glass of milk. He was half asleep </p><p>then, so I went to my room while he was drinking it, </p><p>for he often took a glass of milk in that fashion. I </p><p>had had very little sleep for two or three days and </p><p>dozed off at once with all my clothing on. I could </p><p>not have slept more than a quarter of an hour when </p><p>I was awakened by a crash. It was the crash of </p><p>breaking glass, as I learned an instant later. I </p><p>rushed into his room to see him breathing his last. </p><p>He had overturned the table on which were the </p><p>bottles of medicine. But what a terrible sight </p><p>greeted my eyes! His hands, arms, legs twitched </p><p>and shot out from second to second, then before I </p><p>could even call for help he had a convulsion and </p><p>died. I called Dr. Lawson. It seemed an eternity </p><p>before he answered. Miss Pretty man had heard my </p><p>cries and she was with me. Dr. Lawson asked if </p><p>he had taken anything besides the medicine he </p><p>had prescribed. I said yes, he had taken a hypo- </p><p>dermic and some other opiate. </p><p> ‘‘The hopeless fool,” he cried. “I warned him</p><p>against that very thing. He practically killed him- </p><p>self. The shock of the operation was enough at one </p><p>time.” </p><p> When he reached the house, he said it was too</p><p>late to do anything. </p><p> “Did you look at the bottles on the floor?” asked</p><p>the lawyer. </p><p> “Yes, sir,” replied Ross. “They were all thrown</p><p>together in a broken heap—they had been on a small </p><p>table at his bedside. In his struggles, he must </p><p>have overturned them. Oh, it was terrible, terrible.” </p><p>Here, the young man buried his head in his arms, </p><p>shaking with the power of his emotions. </p><p> “Inspector,” said Dr. Jarvis, “that young man was</p><p>describing a death from strychnine poisoning. We </p><p>must find out where that strychnine came from. </p><p>Look at that girl now!” </p><p> The inspector followed his gaze to where Tessie</p><p>sat. She was obviously horror stricken. A look </p><p>of despair crept into her face as she followed Ross’s </p><p>descent from the stand. Ross was about to go to </p><p>her side but at a sign from the inspector an officer </p><p>took him by the arm, leading him to a chair near the </p><p>inspector. His heart sank as he caught that look </p><p>of despair on the girl’s face.</p><p>EVERY actor in the drama was apparently in </p><p>court. Dr. Jarvis had caught the inspector’s </p><p>fever for a man hunt. It was now a cold problem </p><p>of science. He was not a judge, merely an instru- </p><p>ment of justice. No longer was there a thought in </p><p>his mind, any more than in that of the inspector, </p><p>that any person should be shielded. He was going, </p><p>from now on, to let the chips fall where they would. </p><p> “Inspector,” he said, “the whole situation now</p><p>depends on how much that girl knows. I am going </p><p>to ask Mr. Bailey to put me on the stand. I see </p><p>exactly how the affair was managed, but T haven’t </p><p>the slightest idea of who planned or executed it. </p><p>Anyway, when I get through, if Ross or Tessie had </p><p>any hand in it, they will talk better than if they </p><p>were subjected to the third degree. I am talking </p><p>of murder now; when I am through, it will be your </p><p>affair to bring the guilty person to justice.” </p><p> “H’m,” mused the inspector a second, as if in</p><p>doubt, then posted his men with orders to let no </p><p>one leave the court room until he gave the signal. </p><p>“There might be others,” he reflected, “so why </p><p>not bag them all?” </p><p> Dr. Jarvis now stepped to the table where coun-</p><p>sel and doctors sat. After a few whispered words, </p><p>Mr. Bailey rose to his feet. </p><p> “Mr. Coroner,” he said, “one of our most promi-</p><p>nent physicians, an acknowledged authority and </p><p>the closest friend of the deceased, is our next wit- </p><p>ness. His testimony may clear up some of our dif- </p><p>ficulties.” </p><p> The pursued rarely are ignorant that they are</p><p>pursued. As the lawyer concluded his announce- </p><p>ment. Tessie half rose to her feet, but an officer </p><p>forced her back into her chair. She realized then, </p><p>that she was in custody. She had indeed, divined be- </p><p>fore that the inquest had taken a threatening turn. </p><p>Ross dully watched the progress of events thinking </p><p>how he might shield her from persecution. Lovers </p><p>are impersonal. The world is outside. To him, Jim </p><p>Craighead was still alive. Suspicion did not enter </p><p>his mind. It did not occur to him that he might </p><p>be suspected of murder. Still less did he conceive </p><p>that anyone would accuse of complicity in a mur- </p><p>der, the girl, who to him, was the impersonation of </p><p>innocence. That a net of some evil omen was weav- </p><p>ing about them was too evident to be ignored. Its </p><p>nature, however, was a mystery to him. Yet when </p><p>the doctor, a man whom he knew for the devoted </p><p>friend of his foster father and, as he thought, also </p><p>of himself, got on the stand and began to speak in</p><p>that sure, even voice, which seemed to brook no </p><p>contradiction, he looked somewhat hopefully at that </p><p>dynamic figure. The doctor was a tail, slender man, </p><p>athletic and erect in appearance, with a firm, in- </p><p>tellectual face. </p><p> Dr. Jarvis was sworn. He was then examined on</p><p>his various degrees, his experience, his scientific </p><p>and other studies. Mr. Bailey, instead of asking a </p><p>series of questions, requested him to give any tes- </p><p>timony that might throw light on the death of Jim </p><p>Craighead. </p><p> “I would like you to bear patiently with what</p><p>I have to say,” began Dr. Jarvis, “interrupting, if </p><p>you like, when I have not been sufficiently clear, </p><p>for whatever questions you may care to put. </p><p> “Singularly enough, the mysterious death of the</p><p>best friend I have ever known ceases to be a mystery </p><p>through a remarkable scientific discovery which I </p><p>must rehearse briefly. It is the relative size of the </p><p>smallest bodies known to science. The structure </p><p>of the atom has been analyzed. The atom is the </p><p>smallest particle of matter which can exist indepen- </p><p>dently. The elements which enter into the atom </p><p>have no existence apart from the atom. The atom </p><p>is the smallest particle of matter which can enter </p><p>into the structure of the molecule. But it is not in- </p><p>destructible. It has been broken up into its ele- </p><p>ments. These consist of outer circulatory electrons </p><p>which are negative charges of electricity and a core </p><p>or nucleus composed of positively charged protons </p><p>and some electrons, all in balance. These electrons </p><p>are in constant motion within the atom, revolving </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>about the nucleus much as the planets revolve about </p><p>the sun. </p><p> ‘‘Now, this discovery led to the measurements</p><p>of these tiny particles. Science wanted to learn </p><p>more about the relative masses of atoms and mole- </p><p>cules. The electron is about one thousandth the </p><p>volume of the hydrogen atom. Do not think this </p><p>is all a pedantic discussion. You will see in a very </p><p>few momenta how very practical it all is. </p><p> "The atom,” continued Dr. Jarvis, “is invisible</p><p>under the most powerful microscope. The mole- </p><p>cule is larger, but defies the microscope. But, </p><p>having gone thus far, science had to go further. </p><p>The next larger mass after the molecule, is the </p><p>colloid. A colloid is a formless substance classified </p><p>as a slime. It never takes a definite form like the </p><p>crystalline substances. Solutions of gold can be </p><p>made in the two forms—there is a colloidal gold and </p><p>a crystalline gold.” </p><p> A look of stupefaction was on the faces of the</p><p>inspector, the coroner and all that vast throng in </p><p>the courtroom. Yet a pin could have been heard, </p><p>had it dropped during that tense silence. Back of </p><p>these mystic words an enigma lay. That the doctor </p><p>would clear it up, his easy self assurance seemed to </p><p>guarantee. </p><p> "Even the colloid practically baffles the micro-</p><p>scope. In the ordinary atmosphere, merely cloudy </p><p>impressions can be obtained. How then is the pre- </p><p>sence of any of these tiny particles discovered? It </p><p>is very simple, when the method is disclosed. The </p><p>colloid cannot be seen, but it makes a shadow on an </p><p>electric spark as it passes by. So when the presence </p><p>of a colloid is suspected, its shadow on an electric </p><p>spark betrays it.” </p><p> “Pardon me, Doctor, for interrupting you,” broke</p><p>in the bewildered Mr. Bailey, “but if this discussion </p><p>has any bearing on the death of Jim Craighead. I </p><p>would like to know, if these particles you are talk- </p><p>ing about, are so small that they cannot be seen </p><p>with the strongest microscope, how it helps you any </p><p>to know they make a shadow on an electric spark. </p><p>In fact, how do you know they make a shadow on </p><p>an electric spark?” </p><p>«xrOU may have read at times, Mr. Bailey,” re- </p><p>I plied the doctor, “announcements that as- </p><p>tronomers had located a star known through math- </p><p>ematical calculations to be at some point in the </p><p>heavens, which the telescope has been unable to </p><p>penetrate. Well, the speed of light, which is 186,- </p><p>000	miles a second, helps us. A photograph of the</p><p>heavens will sometimes reveal something which the </p><p>eye could not see. So, a photographic plate will </p><p>sometimes catch the smaller particles as well as the </p><p>largest stars, too far away to be seen. </p><p> “If you consider the light as moving in waves it</p><p>is easier to understand what effect light waves have </p><p>on these discoveries. Artificial light travels in waves </p><p>farther apart than in the case of natural light. The </p><p>waves of this kind of light are so far apart that the </p><p>colloid or small microbe can lie between the waves </p><p>and make no impression on the eye or on the photo- </p><p>graphic plate.” The doctor here took a sheet of </p><p>paper and hastily made a sketch which he showed </p><p>to the jurors and the coroner. </p><p> Artificial light waves:</p><p> CDLLOIO</p><p>/mM </p><p>ARTIFICIAL LIOMT RAYS </p><p> “The waves of natural light are closer together,</p><p>but still too far apart to catch much of the small- </p><p>est germs, like that of cancer, or the colloid, to ad- </p><p>vantage.” The doctor made another sketch. </p><p> Natural light waves:</p><p> .COLLOID</p><p>r&amp;win </p><p> NATURAL LIGHT RAYS</p><p> “In natural light, under the microscope, it is at</p><p>times possible to get a hazy impression which con- </p><p>veys little information. But it has been found pos- </p><p>sible to use the ultra-violet waves which are shorter </p><p>than natural light waves in a vacuum and thus to </p><p>get a photograph of particles too short to be </p><p>caught in ordinary light.” Here the doctor made </p><p>his final drawing. </p><p> Ultra-violet waves:</p><p>-•COLLOID	^</p><p>/tfwinn </p><p>ULTRA-VIOLET RAYS </p><p> “Thus a shadow thrown on a spark of an ultra-</p><p>violet ray in a vacuum will be recorded on a pho- </p><p>tograph of the phenomenon. The discovery of the</p><p>Becquerel Kays, the X-rays and the various rays </p><p>known as “gamma,” etc., were all stepping stones </p><p>to our knowledge of the tiniest particles. Com- </p><p>pared with electrons, atoms and molecules, the col- </p><p>loid is relatively large. </p><p> “A photograph would show the presence of a</p><p>colloid without great difficulty. Now, what is the </p><p>relation of the colloid to the problem we are try- </p><p>ing to solve? During the world war, things were </p><p>learned which were mothered by necessity. Sur- </p><p>gery had to be not only quick but effective. While </p><p>what is known as the shock of an operation is due </p><p>to a toxic condition, it is not what is technically </p><p>known as blood poison. It is definitely the shock </p><p>of the operation. In the world war it was learned </p><p>that the shock of the operation was due to the </p><p>absorption or infiltration of certain toxic or poi- </p><p>sonous substances which belong to the colloid </p><p>family. </p><p> “It was observed that if the haemostats were</p><p>removed from a wounded member, which had been </p><p>amputated, the condition of shock immediately </p><p>was noticeable. This led to the conclusion that the </p><p>haemostats kept out something which could enter </p><p>when they were removed. The inevitable conclu- </p><p>sion which followed was that the cause of shock </p><p>was something which could not pass through an </p><p>animal membrane or tissue, such as the walls of </p><p>the blood vessels. Experiments have shown that </p><p>while crystalline molecules would pass readily </p><p>enough through a parchment filter the colloids re- </p><p>mained behind. </p><p> “So, if a wound is made perfectly sterile and</p><p>haemostats are used to seal the wound hermetic- </p><p>ally, the colloid poisons are excluded and, as they </p><p>could not penetrate an animal membrane, the seal- </p><p>ing of the wound effectually prevents the condition </p><p>known as shock which so often is the fatal result </p><p>of an operation. The tiny colloid, first known by </p><p>THE SHADOW ON THE SPARK </p><p>505 </p><p>its shadow on a spark, cannot enter the blood </p><p>stream if the wound of amputation is sealed. </p><p> “The lessons of the world war showed that the</p><p>wall cells of the blood vessels, the arteries, veins </p><p>and capillaries present a compact and effective bar- </p><p>rier to the passage of the colloidal poisons which </p><p>cause death. Can you see now where we have ar- </p><p>rived? Dr. Lawson has said that Mr. Craighead’s </p><p>death was due to poisons which seeped in through </p><p>the wall cells of the blood vessels. But in this long </p><p>and perhaps tiresome explanation I have shown </p><p>this to be impossible. Jim Craighead did not die </p><p>of the shock of the operation. Dr. Lawson is posi- </p><p>tive that the wound was perfectly clean, that it </p><p>was impossible for infection to have entered at </p><p>the point of amputation. </p><p> “If it was impossible there, it was impossible</p><p>elsewhere. So, if Jim Craighead did not die of the </p><p>shock, he died of something else. It was not blood </p><p>poison, for it would not have acted on a man of </p><p>Craighead’s strength and perfect health, in so </p><p>short a time. Ilis death w'as due neither to blood </p><p>poison nor to shock. Of what, then, did he die? </p><p>Symptoms tell us clearly enough. Craighead’s son </p><p>describes in untechnical language, symptoms </p><p>which point almost unerringly to the fact that </p><p>Craighead died of poison administered to him. </p><p>That poison, I assert was strychnine." </p><p> Had a thunderbolt destroyed the cupola on a</p><p>nearby building and caused it to crash in on them, </p><p>or had a boy rushed in crying that a tidal wave </p><p>was rushing up Broadway, the excitement could </p><p>not have been greater. The girl was crushed. </p><p>Was it guilt that could be read in her terrified fea- </p><p>tures? The coroner’s jury, which a few minutes </p><p>earlier was ready to render a verdict of death due </p><p>to an operation, was now anxious to recommend </p><p>the arrest of a murderer. </p><p>FOR a few seconds the atmosphere of the court </p><p>room was tense—no whispers broke the silence, </p><p>but eyes moved restlessly to the actors in the drama. </p><p>The girl under guard, almost terror stricken, </p><p>looked across beseechingly at her lover. The youth </p><p>returned her gaze, nodding encouragingly. Every </p><p>word spoken by the doctor had burned his soul. </p><p>His steady, calm exterior encouraged the girl and </p><p>she grew calmer. </p><p> This ominous silence was broken by the coroner.</p><p> "Dr. Jarvis,” he said, "the fact of poisoning can</p><p>readily be established by an autopsy. If it reveals, </p><p>as you assert, the presence of poison, arrests must </p><p>follow.” </p><p> “Yes, if after the autopsy, you find the guilty one</p><p>who, being warned, would flee,” cried the inspector, </p><p>who had followed the conclusions of Dr. Jarvis and </p><p>decided upon his course of action. “While you </p><p>are looking for proofs which you are certain to </p><p>find, if Dr. Jarvis is not mistaken, and he does not </p><p>talk like a man who is mistaken, I will take the pre- </p><p>caution of arresting Ross Craighead, on the charge </p><p>of poisoning or being an accessory to the poison- </p><p>ing of his father." </p><p> “What a foul lie!” cried the youth, leaping</p><p>toward the inspector, with whom he would have </p><p>grappled like a wild beast, had not the police inter- </p><p>ceded. After a violent struggle he wras manacled </p><p>so that he could threaten no more harm. The in- </p><p>spector was unmoved by this demonstration. He </p><p>was calculating the girl must move. Either she </p><p>would remain calm, as might be expected of Piggy </p><p>Bill’s "sweetie,” or she would try to save Ross. His </p><p>calculation was perfect. Ross had not yet been </p><p>subdued when the girl’s voice could be heard above </p><p>the tumult. Terror and dismay mingled in her cry. </p><p>She rose to her feet and began to speak. An of- </p><p>ficer grasped her arm to force her back into her </p><p>chair, but the inspector motioned him to release </p><p>her. He spoke to her across the room. </p><p> "Whatever you say, Tessie, will be used against</p><p>you,” he said. “Do you want to take the stand </p><p>again? Perhaps you had better talk to a lawyer/* </p><p> “No, no,” she cried wildly, “I will tell you every-</p><p>thing I know. I did not understand what it all </p><p>meant until Dr. Jarvis had explained. Now I see </p><p>it all and it is too horrible. That boy you accuse, </p><p>Ross—you do not know him. He couldn’t kill a </p><p>rabbit. He would run his car off a bridge to keep </p><p>from hitting a stray cat. He nearly wrecked us </p><p>once to avoid hitting a dog. You can do anything </p><p>to me if he is cleared. But I never committed </p><p>murder. I can’t bear suffering in others—I suffer </p><p>as much as the one I see in pain. But who is going </p><p>to believe me, now?” </p><p> Slowly she moved to the witness box, where she</p><p>took the oath again. </p><p> “Miss Prettyman," said Mr. Bailey, “tell us all</p><p>the facts you know in connection with Mr. Craig- </p><p>head's death. Tell us particularly where you ob- </p><p>tained any of the drugs administered to him during </p><p>the period following his operation.”</p><p> "It is true,” Tessie began, “that I bought all the</p><p>drugs which Mr. Craighead needed. All the pre- </p><p>scriptions were filled by the Groves pharmacy. </p><p>There were two or three for digitalis and one or </p><p>two for antiseptic washes. There was another pre- </p><p>scription which I must describe. The day before </p><p>Mr. Craighead died I went to the prison to see Bill </p><p>Hovey.” </p><p> The inspector whispered quickly to Mr. Bailey,</p><p>beside whom he had taken a chair. The lawyer now </p><p>saw his cue. The girl was to be sweated. In far </p><p>harsher terms than the inspector used for the third </p><p>degree, he shot out: </p><p> “How many times did you go to see this Bill</p><p>Hovey?” </p><p> “Twice, the day before Mr. Craighead died," she</p><p>answered dully. </p><p> "Bill Hovey, in the parlance of the underworld,</p><p>is your ‘sweetie,’ is he not?” pursued the lawyer. </p><p> “You filthy cad,” burst from Ross, who tried un-</p><p>availingly to break his manacles. </p><p> "You’ll be gagged, if you don’t keep quiet,” said</p><p>one of his guards. But the inspector turned and </p><p>motioned for silence. </p><p> “Mr. Bailey,” replied the girl, with dignity and</p><p>resentment, “Bill Hovey is a man who, I have </p><p>learned lately, has committed many wrongs, but </p><p>he is fifty-two years old and I am twenty-two. He </p><p>never was my ‘sweetie,’ as you call him, since you </p><p>are so well acquainted with the underworld; he is </p><p>my stepfather." </p><p> There was a murmur of approval from the spec-</p><p>tators, who obviously did not like the way the ex- </p><p>amination was conducted. Inspector Craven leaned </p><p>toward Dr. Jarvis. </p><p>506 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> “Say, Doc," he whispered, “I’m beginning to see</p><p>light. We’re only getting started. How about </p><p>you?" </p><p> “Did Mr. Craighead and Ross Craighead know</p><p>that your stepfather was in prison?” asked Mr. </p><p>Bailey. </p><p> “When Ross Craighead first asked me to dinner</p><p>at their home,” answered Tessie, “I knew that he </p><p>was showing me serious attention. After dinner, I </p><p>told Mr. Craighead that I had only come so that I </p><p>could talk to him more freely than was possible </p><p>in the office; I told him that my stepfather was a </p><p>drug addict and in prison for having drugs; that </p><p>he was an educated man, but of no account, and </p><p>that he always had plenty of money, although we </p><p>never knew him to work. Still he never was mean </p><p>to us and I saw little of him after my mother died. </p><p>Recently I had not seen him. The last time he saw </p><p>me he told me he was not as ‘flush’ as he had been. </p><p>All this I told Mr. Craighead, thanking him for his </p><p>kindness. Then I intended to leave. But he and </p><p>Ross refused to let me go at all. They said it was </p><p>bad enough to have the father’s sins visited on the </p><p>heads of their children, without taking in the step- </p><p>children, too.” </p><p>PROMPTED by the Inspector, Mr. Bailey con- </p><p>tinued his questions. </p><p> “Why,” he asked, “did you go to see Bill Hovey</p><p>the day before Mr. Craighead died?” </p><p> “I should not have gone at all,” replied Tessie,</p><p>“if Mr. Craighead had not requested it. He sent me </p><p>out a couple of times to a druggist with an old pre- </p><p>scription for narcotics—morphine—and the drug- </p><p>gist refused to fill it. He knew Dr. Lawson had </p><p>forbidden it and was afraid. Then the pain got </p><p>so bad that Mr. Craighead tossed about moaning </p><p>all the time. His tossing only made the pain worse, </p><p>so he called me early in the morning. </p><p> “‘Tessie,’ he said, ‘do you mind going to _ that</p><p>no account stepfather of yours? Ask him if he </p><p>can tell you where to get some morphine. Those </p><p>fellows always know where it is to be had. Just </p><p>say that you want to do me a good turn—that I am </p><p>in great pain.’ </p><p> “I asked Ross what to do. He said, ‘I don t like</p><p>it at all, but he never uses it unless he is suffering, </p><p>so I guess it will be all right to humor him. He </p><p>is always brooding over the loss of his foot, so a</p><p>few hours of freedom from pain may do him good. </p><p>He was like this when he sprained his ankle in a </p><p>tennis game, two years ago. I thought he would </p><p>go mad. He just drugged himself all the time to </p><p>deaden the pain. The doctor said he took enough </p><p>to kill a horse. I often feared he might get the </p><p>habit, but he never did.’ </p><p> “So, I went to see Bill Hovey at the prison. He</p><p>seemed glad to see me and told me what an injus- </p><p>tice had been done him. He said he felt sure he </p><p>could get out if he had money enough to pay the </p><p>lawyers. After he got out he intended to go off </p><p>somewhere and start right again. I told him I was </p><p>glad to hear it and then he said: </p><p> “‘Tessie, I could fix everything up if I had</p><p>$10,000. You could get it, too, to help your father </p><p>out of trouble.’ </p><p> “ ‘How could I get such a sum?’ I asked.</p><p> “ ‘Why, your rich friends, Mr. Craighead and his</p><p>son, they have all kinds of money—they would give </p><p>you $10,000 if you tried them out.’ </p><p> “ ‘If that is the price of asking you a favor, Bill</p><p>Hovey,’ I answered, ‘I may as well go.’ </p><p> “He changed, then—tried to soothe me—said he</p><p>would do anything I wanted—asked me to forget </p><p>what he had said. Then I asked him where I could </p><p>get some morphine. I told him how Mr. Craighead </p><p>was suffering, but that I was doing this of my own </p><p>accord to help him. I didn’t want to tell Bill any- </p><p>thing that might encourage him to try to get money </p><p>from Mr. Craighead. He asked me when I was go- </p><p>ing to be married. I said I didn’t know—Mr. </p><p>Craighead wanted us to wait until Ross was </p><p>well on in the business, because Ross was to suc- </p><p>ceed him. He wanted him to learn the ‘ropes,’ from </p><p>the beginning. </p><p> “ ‘Tessie,’ he said finally, ‘I’ll do this for you</p><p>without any strings. I know of another drug that </p><p>he can use with the morphine. It is called scopola- </p><p>min and is known as a mydriatic. But it has other </p><p>properties, too. Do you know anything about it?’ </p><p>“ ‘No,’ I answered, ‘I never studied much </p><p>chemistry.’ </p><p> “Bill wrote some words hastily. He said it was</p><p>a prescription which I was to take to a place near </p><p>Tarrytown.” </p><p> The moment the girl mentioned “Tarrytown,"</p><p>two hard-faced men in the court room rose hastily </p><p>from their seats, one moving toward the door, the</p><p>other to a corner of the corridor where there was </p><p>a telephone booth. But the inspector, who had fol- </p><p>lowed the girl’s story with the utmost attention, </p><p>was watching every one of the spectators in the </p><p>crowded court room. </p><p> ‘‘Get those two men,” he ordered, pointing to the</p><p>pair, who tried to force their way along more </p><p>quickly. The second man actually entered the tele- </p><p>phone booth, frantically moving the lever to signal </p><p>the operator. An officer pounced on him before </p><p>the operator had answered. He struggled mightily, </p><p>but handcuffs were slipped on his wrists too quickly </p><p>for resistance. His companion reached the door to </p><p>walk into the arms of another officer. </p><p>PANDEMONIUM now reigned in the court </p><p>room. Two reporters rushed to the telephone </p><p>booths. The police made no exception for the men </p><p>of the press. For some minutes the confusion was </p><p>too great for any voice to be heard. Finally the in- </p><p>spector succeeded in making himself heard, his big, </p><p>booming tones dominating the uproar. </p><p> “Mr. Coroner,” he began, “nothing but the neces-</p><p>sity of preventing a crafty scoundrel from making </p><p>his escape could justify my interference with your </p><p>jurisdiction. I am an officer sworn to uphold the </p><p>dignity of your court as well as that of any other </p><p>judge or official. But I knew, if there was a grain </p><p>of truth in the story that young woman on the </p><p>stand was telling, the villain certainly could not be </p><p>without interest in this inquest. He would not dare </p><p>to come himself, nor would he dare to remain </p><p>ignorant of what might transpire. Some trusted </p><p>agent must be present.” </p><p> “Will you continue your story, Miss Pretty-</p><p>THE SHADOW ON THE SPARK </p><p>507 </p><p>man?” asked Mr. Bailey, with more courtesy than </p><p>he had yet shown the girl. </p><p> In a firmer voice, inspired with the hope that her</p><p>story was gaining credence, Tessie resumed her nar- </p><p>rative. </p><p> “Bill wrote the prescription in words I could not</p><p>understand. He said it was Latin. I studied a </p><p>little Latin in school, but not that kind. He called </p><p>it medical Latin; besides, the w'riting was very </p><p>cramped and would have been hard to read even in </p><p>English. The last part of it I could not make out </p><p>at all. </p><p> “‘He’s an artist,’ said Bill, ‘this druggist you</p><p>will visit—a man of parts, though deformed, yet in </p><p>his art, a creature of meticulous skill. Fussy he </p><p>is, too, about his prescriptions—he will always have </p><p>them very proper and formal.’ </p><p> “The prescription bore no address.</p><p> ‘“Where must I take the prescriptions?’ I asked</p><p>him. </p><p> “‘On 42nd Street,’ he said, ‘off Broadway, look</p><p>for a taxicab, not one of the big companies—there </p><p>is a coat of arms on the door, with a figure nine </p><p>above it. Tell the driver Bill sent you with a pre- </p><p>scription. He will take you to the place. It is a </p><p>long ride, but you need have no fear.’ </p><p> "I went to 42nd Street and Broadway, as Bill</p><p>had told me, but I saw so many cars that I thought </p><p>he had tricked me. None of the cars stood more </p><p>than a few seconds. While I stood there be- </p><p>wildered, staring at the doors of all the taxis, one </p><p>stopped opposite me. The driver motioned to me </p><p>and then I noticed that the door had a coat of arms </p><p>and a figure nine. The traffic was stopped for an </p><p>instant. He opened the door for me to step in. The </p><p>moment I was in he closed the door and drove off. </p><p>At first I thought he was crazy, for he drove around </p><p>the block three times, then went over to Sixth Ave- </p><p>nue and drove almost recklessly. After that, he </p><p>turned again two or three times and I recognized </p><p>Broadway. We never left Broadway again until </p><p>we reached Tarrvtown. We passed a number of </p><p>fine estates, and several towns, all new to me, for I </p><p>had never been so far on that road before. But I </p><p>did notice that we never turned until we had passed </p><p>Tarrytown. Some distance beyond Tarrytown—it </p><p>may have been a few miles—the driver took a turn </p><p>to the left toward the river, until we came to quite</p><p>a woods. It looked like part of some big estate that </p><p>had not been well kept or from which its owner had </p><p>been absent a long time. Weeds grew tall, the </p><p>fences were broken and it looked quite deserted. </p><p> “A kind of wagon track led through a gate, which</p><p>hung on one hinge, into the woods. The driver </p><p>lifted the gate to let the car through, then closed it </p><p>again behind him. Some distance from the road, </p><p>well hidden in the trees, we came to a house, once </p><p>a tenanted house, but now looking very dilapidated. </p><p>It did not seem a likely place for a drug store— </p><p>still I said nothing as my stepfather had directed. </p><p> “The car stopped and T stepped out. The driver</p><p>knocked at the door twice, rather sharply. Some </p><p>one peered through a dust-covered window half </p><p>closed by rickety shutters. In a second or two the </p><p>door opened, the driver mumbled a few words and </p><p>we were ushered into a strange room by a mis- </p><p>shapen dwarf. </p><p> “It was fitted up as a drug store—counters,</p><p>shelves filled with bottles, all labeled, graduate </p><p>glasses such as you see in the hospital, rolls of </p><p>bandages, first aid kits and instruments. The drug- </p><p>gist was a hunchback, who filled me with aversion. </p><p>But he merely held out his hand for the prescrip- </p><p>tion, turning his hand to his bottles and glasses as </p><p>soon as I had given it to him. It was easy to see </p><p>that he wras a skilled apothecary by the way he han- </p><p>dled everything. When he had filled the prescrip- </p><p>tion he gave me a package. It contained a bottle of </p><p>colorless liquid which was labelled: ‘Dose—ten </p><p>drops with milk or other liquid.’ There was a small </p><p>box, too, labelled ‘morphine.’ On the bottle was the </p><p>word ‘scopolamin.’ </p><p>«HPHE driver was waiting outside the house for </p><p>A me. It seemed good to get out in the air </p><p>again. Once in the taxicab, the driver backed in </p><p>among the trees to turn around. He drove back </p><p>along Broadway until he came to the city line. There </p><p>he told me that I could return along the subway. </p><p>All this mystery so puzzled me that I determined </p><p>to see Bill again to learn if the prescription was </p><p>properly filled. When I saw Bill Hovey I showed </p><p>him the bottle. There were many bottles in his cell. </p><p>He was known to be a good chemist and worked </p><p>in the prison drug shop. He took this bottle and </p><p>held it to the light. Then he took a sip of it. </p><p>‘Seems to be all right,’ he said. He wrapped up a </p><p>bottle, but I know now, that he must have given </p><p>me a different one. I put it in my pocket. From </p><p>the prison I went straight to Mr. Craighead. Ross </p><p>was with him. I said: </p><p> “‘Why all this round-about way to get a little</p><p>drug? It was all horrible. I wish that you would </p><p>not take any more of the stuff.’ </p><p> “Mr. Craighead just laughed. ‘Well, little girl,’</p><p>he said, ‘if a man insists on buying liquor, he must </p><p>go to rather ugly looking places to get it—if he </p><p>must have morphine, and the doctors will not get </p><p>it for him, he must go to even uglier places. But </p><p>we will never try that again!’ </p><p> “That night he took a hypodermic, but never</p><p>touched the bottle. He kept all out of sight when </p><p>Dr. Lawson came the next morning. Toward night </p><p>his pain became intense again. That must have </p><p>been why he used the drug the misshapen druggist </p><p>had given me. If I had only known—oh, if I had </p><p>only known.” </p><p> Tessie gave way to uncontrollable sobbing.</p><p> When she had grown somewhat composed, Mr.</p><p>Bailey asked: </p><p> “Could you read the prescription at all?”</p><p> “One word, only,” replied Tessie, “Scopolamin.”</p><p> “What became of the prescription?”</p><p> “There was a file,” said Tessie, “with a number</p><p>of other prescriptions filed upon it; the drug- </p><p>gist put the one Bill had given me with the others.” </p><p>Half dazed by the ordeal through which she had </p><p>passed, Tessie walked unhindered to where Ross </p><p>sat manacled. Inspector Craven himself removed </p><p>the handcuffs from the boy’s wrists. He drew the </p><p>girl to a chair beside him. </p><p> “Mr. Coroner," said Inspector Craven, rising, “I</p><p>am prepared now to make the extraordinary request </p><p>which I mentioned before Miss Prettyman had </p><p>508 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>completed her testimony. There is but one way to </p><p>test her story fairly. Assuming, as I do, that her </p><p>story is true, she would be placed in jeopardy, if </p><p>the men who tricked her were allowed to escape. It </p><p>is possible to trap the druggist, who doubtless, with </p><p>mind warped by affliction, is capable of aiding as- </p><p>sassins who use poison. If the court is willing to </p><p>hold this session open until I have had time to </p><p>verify this extraordinary tale and capture, if pos- </p><p>sible, the author of a diabolical plot, several unex- </p><p>plained murders of the same sort may be solved. </p><p>But in order that no warning may be given, I </p><p>request you to make an order that no one leave this </p><p>court room until I return.” </p><p> "It is an extraordinary request, Inspector Cra-</p><p>ven,” replied the coroner, “so extraordinary that I </p><p>do not know if I have so much arbitrary power. </p><p>Before even deciding I must ask you a question to </p><p>clear up the young woman’s story. Is it possible </p><p>that she visited this Hovey in prison and that it was </p><p>possible for him to give her writing without de- </p><p>tection ?” </p><p> "When a man like Bill Hovey is captured, Mr.</p><p>Coroner,” answered the inspector, “he is often given </p><p>a great deal of apparent freedom in order that he </p><p>may betray his confederates, and also in a narcotic </p><p>case, that he may betray the hiding place of a lot of </p><p>dangerous drugs. It was even contemplated to </p><p>release Hovey and keep him under surveillance, but </p><p>he is so slippery a character that the plan was </p><p>abandoned as too risky. Two men were detailed to </p><p>follow the young woman on her visit to Hovey. </p><p>They were not clever enough for the job. The taxi </p><p>driver went three times around the block with the </p><p>officers two cars behind on his trail. The driver </p><p>knew it. He drove around the block until he saw </p><p>the traffic signal about to change. He dashed across </p><p>the street while the officers waited until the signal </p><p>was changed again. When they crossed the street </p><p>the taxi they were following had disappeared. The </p><p>taxi, as Miss Prettyman has related, did not return </p><p>to the city that night. When she returned to the </p><p>prison, the officers who were supposed to be watch- </p><p>ing her, were still looking for the taxicab, which </p><p>they learned had turned into Broadway. This inci- </p><p>dent, however, will result in more stringent rules </p><p>and curtailment of prisoners’ privileges. </p><p>cctttHAT I propose to do is this,” continued In- </p><p>» ' spector Craven. "I propose to take Tessie </p><p>and Doctor Jarvis with me to Tarrytown. Unless </p><p>he has been warned, the druggist will be awaiting </p><p>news. Two men from this room are in custody.</p><p>There may be others posted here. For that reason </p><p>our mission will be futile if anyone is permitted </p><p>to leave.” </p><p> “If I make such an order,” said the coroner, “your</p><p>men will have to enforce it. No matter how you </p><p>travel you cannot go to Tarrytown and back under </p><p>five hours.” </p><p> “That is true, Mr. Coroner,” said the inspector,</p><p>“yet this is worthy of consideration. In the last </p><p>four years there have been seven unexplained mur- </p><p>ders through poisons which cannot be obtained </p><p>without a prescription. Yet no prescriptions for </p><p>those poisons have been found nor has the source </p><p>of them been traced. Here we have two desperate </p><p>men skilled in toxicology with a supply of danger- </p><p>ous substances.” </p><p> The coroner hesitated no longer. Rising from his</p><p>chair, he pronounced his decree: </p><p> “As the presiding officer of this court I hereby</p><p>enjoin and forbid any person to leave this court- </p><p>room until the return of Inspector Craven or until </p><p>he has advised the Court from Tarrytown, which I </p><p>require him to do the instant he has accomplished </p><p>or failed to accomplish his mission.” </p><p> An additional detail of officers had arrived. There</p><p>were a few murmurs against this exercise of auto- </p><p>cratic power, yet the murmurs were soft, for there </p><p>was no spectator of the unexpected turn of events </p><p>in the courtroom, who did not want to be present at </p><p>the denouement. Some openly believed the girl was </p><p>lying. Others quite vehemently espoused her cause. </p><p>Obviously the hours would not be dull in the court </p><p>room until the party returned. </p><p> The girl, a picture of abject despair, sat at the</p><p>side of her affianced lover, uncertain of a future </p><p>which only a few days before seemed rosy with the </p><p>dawn of hope. Turning to her, the inspector said: </p><p>“Tessie, you must show the way to the druggist </p><p>near Tarrytown. It means freedom and vindication </p><p>for you and Ross if we verify your words. Doctor, </p><p>if we can find that prescription, it will need more </p><p>Latin than I ever knew to decipher it. Ross, I </p><p>think it is coming out right—as right as it can.” </p><p>To this Ross made no reply. He pressed Tessie’s </p><p>hand in farewell, then the trio left the courtroom, </p><p>hundreds of curious eyes following them. Some </p><p>women whispered as Tessie passed them: </p><p> “Good luck, dearie!”</p><p> Inspector Craven, not daring to trust himself, as</p><p>he remarked to the doctor, took one of his men along</p><p>as chauffeur. He feared that he would drive too </p><p>fast for safety. So he said to the officer: </p><p>"Tarrytown, Beronio, at the best you can get out </p><p>of her.” </p><p> The automobile had a riot car siren, but it is safe</p><p>to assert that no riot car ever ran like that one. </p><p>There were few curves to make and with a few ex- </p><p>ceptions, the road was perfectly straight all the way. </p><p> The car could run at a speed of over sixty. It</p><p>ran very nearly that the entire distance. As they </p><p>raced along the highway, Tessie felt the universe </p><p>slipping from her. The thought of what place in </p><p>the world might be hers when this nightmare was </p><p>over terrified her. The doctor read some of her </p><p>thought from her expression and, trying to make </p><p>her talk pointed out objects along the road—a diffi- </p><p>cult task, with the car dashing along so that tele- </p><p>phone and telegraph posts almost resembled a </p><p>picket fence. She replied in monosyllables. Finally </p><p>he said: </p><p> “You mustn’t worry so much, my child. What is</p><p>your anxiety, now?” </p><p> “Oh,” she cried, gulping to keep down a sob, “if</p><p>the hunchback has taken alarm and gone away, what </p><p>will become of Ross and me?” </p><p> “The shack will still be there, won’t it? That</p><p>will confirm part of your story,” said the doctor. </p><p> These words bewildered the trembling young</p><p>woman. </p><p> ‘You don’t believe, then, that I gave him poison</p><p>deliberately?” she faltered. </p><p> “I would need more proof than we have now,”</p><p>answered Dr. Jarvis. </p><p> To this enigmatic reply there was no response.</p><p>THE SHADOW ON THE SPARK </p><p>509 </p><p>They were not long in reaching Tarrytown, where </p><p>Inspector Craven turned to Tessie, saying: </p><p> “You had better keep your eyes open now for the</p><p>place where you turned off the main road. The </p><p>speedometer says 52 now; if your guess of the dis- </p><p>tance is accurate, we should run much slower.” </p><p>Beronio ran the car more slowly for three miles, </p><p>but Tessie did not recognize the turn. Nearing four </p><p>miles, as the inspector was beginning to be assailed </p><p>by doubts, she said suddenly: </p><p> “Just beyond here, I remember, is the cross road.</p><p>This gateway with the two stone lions at each side, </p><p>opened as we passed—a car coming out delayed us </p><p>for a moment. It should be less than a city block </p><p>ahead.” </p><p>THE inspector felt almost cheerful when, two </p><p>hundred feet farther on, another road crossed </p><p>their path. </p><p> “To the left, Beronio,” he ordered, “when you</p><p>come to the trees take the wagon trail and go just </p><p>a short distance.” </p><p> Inspector Craven said these words fatuously, like</p><p>a man who has learned a lesson in which he has not </p><p>the slightest belief, who has been told to memorize </p><p>the first fifty lines and mumbles the words like a </p><p>talking doll. They were all unnerved as the final </p><p>test approached. Mentally, the inspector blamed </p><p>the doctor who had led him into a fool journey like </p><p>this. Tessie was in a panic, fearing the escape of </p><p>the dwarf. Dr. Jarvis alone seemed unconcerned. </p><p>His tall fiprure, erect and commanding, his lips com- </p><p>pressed in a firm, straight, uncompromising line, </p><p>expressed no doubt whatever. The car stopped. </p><p>Doctor Jarvis was the first to get out. Inspector </p><p>Craven was at his side in an instant. Beronio </p><p>opened the crazily hanging gate and ran his car </p><p>into the shelter of the trees. </p><p> “How far did you go into the woods, Tessie?”</p><p>asked the inspector. </p><p> "Possibly four or five blocks," replied the girl.</p><p>"Beronio, give the doctor your gun,” ordered In- </p><p>spector Craven. “He may need it. Lead on Tessie, </p><p>but go softly." </p><p> The evening was coming on, the autumn air was</p><p>cool and damp in the neglected woods, weedy, with </p><p>thick undergrowth; it was difficult to think of a </p><p>house of any sort there. Yet they followed the</p><p>girl, breathlessly, almost treading on her heels. </p><p>Five hundred yards they trudged along the winding </p><p>path when Tessie stopped. </p><p> “Look,” she whispered, pointing to the right.</p><p>Both men followed her glance, seeing with relief </p><p>a dilapidated tenant house, to all appearances un- </p><p>occupied, save for an almost imperceptible thin line </p><p>of smoke which was just visible above the broken </p><p>edge of the chimney. The door was closed, but </p><p>would probably offer no formidable obstacle. Shut- </p><p>ters hung crazily over the one window which opened </p><p>on the front of the house. They were half closed, </p><p>held by a bit of soiled ribbon. </p><p> “Doc,” whispered the inspector, “I am going to</p><p>slip over to the door. If anyone tries to drop out </p><p>by that side window, use your gun. If any of </p><p>Hovey’s gang is about, they won’t mince matters.” </p><p>Inspector Craven was himself, now. The house </p><p>was here, that was certain. Stealthily he moved </p><p>toward the door. Unperceived, he gained the door- </p><p>way, where he stood for a moment listening for </p><p>signs of life. Finally he heard a clinking of glass, </p><p>a very faint tinkling. He put his big shoulder </p><p>against the door. It was bolted and resisted his </p><p>first assault. He thought no longer of who might </p><p>be inside and with a mighty impact, burst the door </p><p>open. As he almost fell over the threshold, a shot </p><p>rang out and a twinge in the left shoulder told him </p><p>it was a good shot. But he fired at the flash, which </p><p>was followed by a cry of pain. He had hit his </p><p>enemy in the gun arm. There was light enough for </p><p>Craven to see a hunchback, who stood looking wick- </p><p>edly at the gun which covered him. The instant </p><p>the reports rang out Doctor Jarvis and Tessie had </p><p>run to the door of the shanty. </p><p> “Are you hurt, inspector?” asked Jarvis.</p><p> “He winged me in the left shoulder,” said Craven</p><p>grimly. “If I had not stumbled when the door gave </p><p>way it would have been worse, for it was well aimed </p><p>for the heart. Pretty lookin’ bird, ain't he? Is he </p><p>the one who filled the prescription, Tessie?” </p><p> “Yes,” replied the girl, while the dwarf looked at</p><p>her malevolently. </p><p> A small fire burned in an open stove. As the</p><p>doctor, seeing the blood on Inspector Craven’s coat, </p><p>began to examine him to learn the extent of his </p><p>injury, the hunchback, with a quick movement, </p><p>grasped a bundle of papers spiked on a file and </p><p>threw them into the stove. </p><p> “The prescriptions, the prescriptions!” cried Tes-</p><p>sie, in a panic. </p><p>FORGETTING his wound, the inspector leaped </p><p>at the hunchback, felling him to the floor with a </p><p>heavy blow from the butt of his revolver. He sank </p><p>to the floor, motionless. Doctor Jarvis had darted </p><p>to the stove from which he retrieved the sheaf of </p><p>papers, little the worse from the flames except </p><p>where the hot coals had singed the edges. The doc- </p><p>tor’s fingers suffered most from contact with the </p><p>embers. </p><p> “Tessie,” said the inspector, nursing his wounded</p><p>shoulder, “run through those papers. See if you </p><p>can find anything that looks like the prescription </p><p>Bill Hovey gave you." </p><p> Eagerly enough, now, she lifted one sheet after</p><p>another from the file. Not far from the top she </p><p>came on one which she examined carefully. </p><p> “This is it,” she said, holding it out for Dr. Jarvis</p><p>to read. His professional instincts, however, over- </p><p>came his curiosity. </p><p> “Inspector,” he cried, somewhat shamefacedly,</p><p>remorseful for neglect toward a wounded friend, </p><p>“let us have a look at that shoulder first.” </p><p> “It hurts like the devil,” said Inspector Craven,</p><p>“but that bird is stirring, so safety first. Take a </p><p>pair of handcuffs out of my pocket and snap them </p><p>on his wrists. He would blow us all up and himself, </p><p>too, if he got the chance.” </p><p> Dr. Jarvis secured the misshapen dwarf, clumsily</p><p>enough, then looked at his wound. The dwarf’s arm </p><p>was bleeding. Without too great delay, for he was </p><p>much more worried over the inspector than over the </p><p>misshapen druggist, he bound the wound tightly </p><p>to prevent further bleeding. In all this commotion, </p><p>although he stirred, the man did not regain con- </p><p>sciousness. He had been dealt a stiff blow. </p><p> The inspector was not seriously wounded. The</p><p>510 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>bullet fired by the hunchback, from a vicious little </p><p>automatic .25 had gone straight through the shoul- </p><p>der muscles, severing the smaller blood vessels. It </p><p>was a matter of a few minutes to dress the wound, </p><p>but Craven was impatient to learn the truth. Had </p><p>they found the prescription? If they had, his wound </p><p>mattered little. If not, he was a fool. He had </p><p>made a melodrama of a coroner’s investigation. If </p><p>without cause, he was a zany. With cause, he pre- </p><p>served his self-respect at least. </p><p> “Doc,” he said, as soon as the bandage was drawn</p><p>tight and a tourniquet applied, "see what kind of a </p><p>fist Piggy Bill writes. If it’s the literature the little </p><p>lady says, I’ll bet it against Shakespeare.” </p><p> Doctor Jarvis then spread the paper Tessie had</p><p>given him on the counter, while Tessie and the </p><p>inspector leaned over his shoulder. </p><p> “The first paragraph calls for morphine and sco-</p><p>polamin,’’ said he. “But scopolamin has no virtue </p><p>in a surgical case. But wait,” he added, “there is </p><p>more. My God, what infamy!” </p><p> For a moment he was speechless, then began read-</p><p>ing words incomprehensible to his hearers. </p><p> “Monsieur et cher amiwas the salutation, then</p><p>came the following words: "C’est bien drole que le </p><p>mot ‘scopolamin’ et le mot qui exprime l’extrait de </p><p>la noix vomique ont la meme total; il serait bien </p><p>dommage si Ton prendrait l’un pour l’autre.” </p><p>“What does it all mean?” asked Inspector Craven. </p><p>“Well,” answered the doctor, “it is not medical </p><p>Latin nor any other kind of Latin. It is written in </p><p>fairly good French, not at all difficult to follow. </p><p>This is how it reads: ‘My dear friend: it is very </p><p>curious that the word “scopolamin” and the word </p><p>which signifies the extract of nux vomica have the </p><p>same number of letters. It would be sad if one </p><p>mistook the one for the other.’ </p><p> “That was why he told Tessie scopolamin would</p><p>help Craighead. It happened to have the same num- </p><p>ber of letters the way he spelled it (without the </p><p>‘e’) as strychnine. Strychnine is an alkaloid of </p><p>nux vomica. He knew Tessie was ignorant of </p><p>French—the rest was easy. But I don’t understand </p><p>what he hoped to gain by it.” </p><p> “What, a hard-boiled guy like that?” shouted the</p><p>inspector. “Hell, he needed $10,000. If Tessie got </p><p>married he would send for her and tell the story </p><p>counting on her fear to see that he got enough to</p><p>pay the lawyer who guaranteed to get him out. Why. </p><p>this bunch saw Tessie paying blackmail for murder </p><p>the next ten years.” Then turning to the girl, he </p><p>continued: </p><p> “Tessie, you have our compliments. I hope for-</p><p>tune will smile on you. This has been a terrible </p><p>ordeal for a young girl.” </p><p> “Indeed,” sobbed the girl, as reaction set in, “I</p><p>do not care about fortune, now. How can I live, </p><p>knowing that I helped kill my benefactor, the one </p><p>who was as much a father to me as my own might </p><p>have been had he lived.” </p><p> The doctor took the bundle of prescriptions and</p><p>with a number of vials containing prohibited drugs, </p><p>narcotics and toxic substances, they returned to the </p><p>car, the doctor forcing the hideous looking dwarf to </p><p>walk beside him. They found his name to be Tim- </p><p>othy Clegg, from one of the prescriptions. He was </p><p>bundled into the car and the return journey to the </p><p>metropolis began. At Tarrytown, the inspector </p><p>stopped long enough to have a couple of officers sent </p><p>TTTP </p><p> to guard the drug store hidden in the woods, so that</p><p> no evidence might be destroyed. In the prescrip-</p><p> tions were enough orders for deadly poisons, signed</p><p> by Piggy Bill Hovey, to damn him many times over.</p><p> The proof in the Craighead case was convincing.</p><p> Inspector Craven then telephoned the coroner of</p><p> the success of their mission. Beronio returned to</p><p> town in more leisurely fashion. When they arrived</p><p> at the Coroner’s Court with their prisoner and the</p><p> inspector showing the evidences of a battle, the</p><p> scene that followed beggared all description. Hand-</p><p> cuffed and heavily guarded, the dwarf sullenly</p><p> glared at his captors. Inspector Craven, despite his</p><p> wound, took the stand. He described their journey</p><p> in complete detail, verifying Tessie’s story. Calls</p><p> for order failed to check the applause for the girl.</p><p> DR. JARVIS followed the inspector. He identi-</p><p> fied the prescription, and gave its hideous im-</p><p> port so vividly that the spectators shuddered. The</p><p> jury took but a few minutes to render a verdict.</p><p> As the verdict was announced, a finely dressed</p><p> woman murmured audibly:</p><p> “What a monstrous injustice! That young man</p><p> inherits all his father’s wealth, although he helped</p><p> to kill him.”</p><p> She was one of Jim Craighead’s numerous cousins</p><p> and chagrined that his big estate was beyond her</p><p> reach. Ross Cragihead was too far away to hear</p><p> her remark, but she heard his reply breathlessly,</p><p> for he rose to his feet, before the crowd, dazed by</p><p> the rapid turn of events. He took hold of Tessie’s</p><p> arm, and stood near the coroner.</p><p> “I want to say to you, Mr. Coroner, publicly,” he</p><p> began, "to Dr. Jarvis and to Inspector Craven, that</p><p> after what has been revealed here today, it is im-</p><p> possible for me to take one penny from my father’s</p><p> estate. His will makes Dr. Jarvis executor and</p><p> gives him certain powers of distribution, in case I,</p><p> for any reason, do not succeed to the property.</p><p> Since I, however innocently, was, with Tessie, the</p><p> instrument of his death, the money would come to</p><p> me stained with blood. Yet this tragedy has knitted</p><p> the fate of Tessie and myself in an indissoluble</p><p> way. With what we have, we leave this city tonight</p><p> —we shall be married at once. Then we shall go</p><p> far from this place of dreadful memories to live as</p><p> best we can, what life has in store for us. If we</p><p> are free, we will go at once.”</p><p> “You are free,” said the coroner. “All the evi-</p><p> dence is now on record.”</p><p> The crowd moved aside to let them pass. As they</p><p> moved toward the door, the girl clutched with both</p><p> hands, the arm of her partner in crime. Unwilling</p><p> criminals!</p><p> The dwarf was never tried. He was found dead</p><p> in his cell the next morning, despite the careful</p><p> guard set to prevent his suicide. A small capsule in</p><p> his mouth showed that he was always prepared for</p><p> the possibility of capture. Piggy Bill died myste-</p><p> riously before any charge was presented against</p><p> him. “Suicide,” remarked Inspector Craven, "as</p><p> Webster once said, is confession.”</p><p> A year later. Dr. Jarvis received an announcement</p><p> from Sydney. Australia, telling of the birth of “Jim</p><p> Craighead, Second.” “a wonderful, blond boy,</p><p> healthy and noisy.” The doctor smiled as he re-</p><p> called that his power of appointment had not been</p><p> exercised.</p><p> !\TI.</p><p>MDIo </p><p>WHOLESALE PRICES </p><p>— for Dealers, Community Set Builders, General Repairmen and Agents — </p><p> ■UTE havo )uit tssued a new catalog with not prices to Uio radio trade.

Y. </p><p>HICKS’ INVENTIONS WITH A KICK </p><p> (By HENRY HUGH SIMMONS)</p><p> (Continued from, -page 497)</p><p>bling with the buttons. “It won't work,” the in- </p><p>ventor wailed. “Something has gone wrong with </p><p>the system. I remember now,” he added, “I had </p><p>the hand release taken out—just taken out experi- </p><p>mentally. I’ll have to put it in again. . . .” </p><p> “You will have it put in again, you confounded</p><p>peanut-headed dumb-bell,” roared Irvine above the </p><p>shrieks of the professor and the wails of the </p><p>female company, “when the professor has had his </p><p>face scalped and has been murdered. Go and cut </p><p>the juice off, I tell you! Haven’t you got enough </p><p>sense?” </p><p> The entire company stood assembled around</p><p>where the professor was having the shine of his </p><p>life, everybody suggesting, talking, shouting. </p><p>Smith tried helpfully to pull the professor out by </p><p>the legs. Redoubled shrieks of agony made him </p><p>desist from his Christian endeavor. I drew my </p><p>watch. Only one minute was over. Would that </p><p>fool never be able to cut off the juice? “I got it!” </p><p>yelled Hicks, as we heard the switch of a button. </p><p> At once I felt that something was wrong, wrong</p><p>—very much wrong again. I did not know what </p><p>it was. Yes, I did. It was the water rising on my </p><p>feet. Did I say just a while ago it was funny how </p><p>the human mind acts? You know, the first thing </p><p>I thought of was the professor. “Cut it out, </p><p>Hicks,” I roared, “you will drown him.” </p><p> “I will,” came back the despairing cry of the</p><p>inventor. “I will, I will, I will! But I can’t. There </p><p>is something radically wrong here. Something </p><p>must be wrong, I am sure,—I know something is </p><p>wrong!” and he went into a spasm of working with </p><p>the switchboard. </p><p>I TOO thought that something must be wrong. </p><p>Meanwhile the water was rising at the rate of </p><p>about half an inch a second. I took only a short men- </p><p>tal calculation to see that within less than a minute </p><p>it must be above the professor’s mouth and there </p><p>was still a minute and a half to go before the release </p><p>would act. I pride myself on quick thinking in an </p><p>emergency. Near the dish washing machine I had </p><p>seen a piece of large rubber hose. I made a dash for </p><p>it, splashing through the water, which was now half </p><p>a foot deep. I got back just in time. “Take this </p><p>in your mouth, professor, and quit your roaring, or </p><p>you will drown," I screamed in his ears. Some in- </p><p>stinct told him I was right and he did as he was</p><p>told. In a few seconds the water was up over his </p><p>face, but he was breathing through the hose. </p><p> “Get out of here, the rest of you, or there may be</p><p>the devil to pay!” I ordered. “You can’t do the pro- </p><p>fessor any good and the water is rising. Get out!” </p><p> To her honor it must be said that the prim Miss</p><p>Peak remained. “I’ll stay with you to the end, dear, </p><p>and hold your hand,” she crooned over the rising </p><p>waters—for the professor was beyond hearing. Un- </p><p>der the water the brushes were working with un- </p><p>diminished speed, raising little gurgling eddies to </p><p>testify to their action. The rest of the company </p><p>splashed through the inundation, which was by this </p><p>time a foot and a half deep, toward the front room. </p><p>With difficulty, they opened the door and instantly </p><p>I felt the outward rush of water, while the level fell </p><p>several inches in the kitchen to start rising again </p><p>soon after. All of a sudden I heard screams of ter- </p><p>ror. “Hold the hose,” I ordered Miss Peak, and </p><p>rushed,—or rather sloshed, toward the front room. </p><p>There I beheld a sight I will never forget. The fur- </p><p>niture had been shifted to one side, blocking the </p><p>door. The water was two feet high. Irvine was </p><p>standing on a table—did I tell you before that he </p><p>always was a coward? Smith and his wife, my aunt </p><p>and the inventor were in various attitudes of pros- </p><p>tration in the water, and every time one tried to rise </p><p>he would suddenly sit down. He would get up, make </p><p>a step, and kerplunk! sit down in the water. “Some- </p><p>thing is murdering us, O’Keefe,” roared Smith. “Oh, </p><p>it is biting me,” screamed Aunt Eulalia. For a </p><p>moment I was bewildered, dumbfounded. Why didn’t </p><p>they stay up? Then the truth flashed upon me. </p><p>That confounded Automatic Carpet Sweeper was </p><p>there under the water, rushing back and forth, and </p><p>it was mowing down the people as fast as they could </p><p>get up. “All get up on the table!” I shrieked, “or </p><p>you will be killed.” Evidently they were ready for </p><p>any advice, for they scrambled out over the chairs </p><p>and on the table with an alacrity begotten of des- </p><p>peration. They could all just find room on it. Just </p><p>at that moment all the furniture made a quick move </p><p>as if galvanized, moving toward the opposite end of </p><p>the room, and all five sat down in the lake below. </p><p>Screams and curses instantly rent the air. There </p><p>again was that confounded suction sweeper, no </p><p>longer sucking, but running all the same along the </p><p>floor, knocking the unfortunate people down as fast </p><p>as they managed to rise. “Get back on the table,” I </p><p>bellowed, and at that moment, remembering the pro- </p><p>fessor’s plight, I rushed back. By this time the </p><p>water was three feet deep and was getting close to </p><p>the end of the hose. But thank goodness, there were </p><p>only twenty seconds left until the release would </p><p>work. During the stress of excitement, a life seems</p><p>crowded into seconds. And did you ever notice how </p><p>during a serious crisis, you will do unimportant </p><p>things? Perhaps I needed a mental rest, for just </p><p>then I saw the Automatic Egg Beater in front of </p><p>me. It flashed through my thoughts that Hicks had </p><p>said that it ran at a speed of 15000 R.P.M. It </p><p>would be interesting to see that spindle go. This </p><p>was my chance. I could do nothing until the release </p><p>worked—why not put time to good use? All these </p><p>thoughts crowded themselves into that brief mo- </p><p>ment. I bent down close to the beater to observe </p><p>the way the spindle acted, and pressed the button. </p><p>The egg-beater started like a gun. A lock of my </p><p>hair was sucked in and wrapped around the high- </p><p>speed spindle. In a hundredth part of the tick of a </p><p>dollar watch my head was pulled up until my fore- </p><p>head rubbed it. There was a brief moment of con- </p><p>centrated agony, a feeling as if my head would ex- </p><p>plode, and three solid handsful of my hair, pulled </p><p>out by the roots, were distributed over the surround- </p><p>ings. I turned off the switch. My mind was cleared </p><p>and so was my forehead of every vestige of hirsute </p><p>adornment, while a little stream of blood slowly </p><p>trickled down over my nose. </p><p>r- -&gt; </p><p> ✓ T.

He looked like a native </p><p>chief of Dahomey who had taken a bath with his European </p><p>clothes on. The first thing he did was to let out a vast and </p><p>good old American curse involving Hicks. So I knew he </p><p>was all right. I heard a sudden commotion in the front </p><p>room. There was a thundering as of water downstairs. </p><p>And it was. Somebody had opened the door. Something </p><p>else but water was running downstairs, however—in fact, </p><p>it was some body. It was Irvine and Smith. But they </p><p>were not first. The inventor was ahead of them. I looked </p><p>out of the window. There he was, going down the street </p><p>like a streak, doing a hundred yards in exactly a couple of </p><p>seconds, less than very little. Shades of all the runners of </p><p>romance! He would have made them look like nothing. </p><p>Smith and Irvine were doing well, but they were hopelessly </p><p>outdistanced. In five seconds the inventor was out of sight. </p><p> Then I remembered that I was the one who had fixed the</p><p>thing up. I began to think. Gruesome details of several </p><p>recent lynchings flashed through my mind. Without stop- </p><p>ping for my hat, I crept down the stairs. At the entrance </p><p>I	looked around cautiously. Then I squared my shoulders</p><p>and walked away in the most dignified manner I could mus- </p><p>ter and reached home, none the worse for the experience, </p><p>which is as it should have been, for it was not my fault. </p><p>The End. </p><p>Discussions </p><p> In this department we shall discuss. every month, topics of Interest to renders.

Amazing Stories: </p><p> I have read all the letters published in your</p><p>magazine about the stories you print. Altogether </p><p>1 wish to compliment you on your choice of stones </p><p>as I have enjoyed nearly all of them. I can hardly </p><p>wait to finish the magazine nnd then I have to wait </p><p>another month to repeat the same cycle. I am </p><p>heartily in favor of a semi-monthly cow of your </p><p>magazine and think that many other* are also in </p><p>favor of it. I know several readers of your maga: </p><p>zine in this vicinity and they are all in favor ot</p><p>two a month. As you say, no one can please every- </p><p>one, but you seem to please most of your readers </p><p>according to the letters you publish. Although </p><p>some of them seem to like a certain class such as </p><p>strictly scientific or almost all imaginative, thcv </p><p>all seem to like enough of them to keep on reading </p><p>the magazine. </p><p> I think that many of your stories such as, '•The</p><p>Educated Harpoon,” "Tbrf Man Higher Up. The </p><p>First Men In The Moon, ’ etc.. arc very good. </p><p>Either they are interesting just to read or they are </p><p>interesting for the facts which are made use of. </p><p>I like many of the stories of Wells hut some of </p><p>his are not very interesting just to read. Serviss </p><p>writes good stories both to read and to get science </p><p>from. I think that you ought to encourage other </p><p>iwple to write in ways such as the latest contest </p><p>and by offering a prize say every other month to </p><p>the best original story by young authors who have </p><p>no stories which have been published. </p><p> Tons R. Kr_i.Lv,</p><p> Rock River, Wyo.</p><p>[Such a letter as this one from the standpoint of </p><p>an editor may be termed it once instructive and </p><p>suggestive.

Wc feel that the recent </p><p>prize which we offered encouraged a number of </p><p>writers to produce excellent stories. We considered </p><p>the picture rather difficult to base a story on. To </p><p>tell the truth it was purposely made so. but it pro- </p><p>duced some excellent work. We can make no </p><p>promises as yet about the semi-monthly issuing of </p><p>our magazine, but in hoping for it we shall feel </p><p>that wc are supported by many appreciated readers. </p><p>-EDITOR.] </p><p>INTERPLANETARY STORIES ASKED FOR </p><p>Editor, Amazing Stories: </p><p> I am glad that you are putting in a story by</p><p>EdRar Rice Burroughs. I hive always liked his </p><p>books and I hope vou will publish more of them, </p><p>especially the Martian books. I like stories about </p><p>interplanetary space, and about the different planets. </p><p>The Second Deluge is one of the best stories I </p><p>have ever read. I would like to know If you have </p><p>anv back iisues of the Amazing Stories from last </p><p>April to August. I hope you will soon put the </p><p>Amazing Stories magazine out twice a month. I </p><p>am now getting the magazine at a store but I will </p><p>soon send for it and for Science and Invention. </p><p>Clifford Kornoelje,</p><p>Chicago, HI. </p><p> [We have sometimes feared that we were giving</p><p>too manv interplanetary stories, _ but your letter </p><p>tells us that we have not, and like Oliver Twist </p><p>yon virtually "ask for more." More are coming. </p><p>-EDITOR.) </p><p>FICTION NOT TO BE CRITICIZED LIKE </p><p>STATEMENTS OF FACT </p><p>Editor, Amazing Stories: </p><p> Upon reading the January issue of your inter-</p><p>esting magazine, particularly the "Discussions Col- </p><p>umn," I wu immediately struck by the puerility of </p><p>several of the correspondents. Criticism of such </p><p>authors as Verne, Poe or Wells, it seems to me, </p><p>should rest with persons more versed in the liter- </p><p>ary art than these correspondents appear to be. As </p><p>to the names of these great men being used as a </p><p>drawing card for your magazine, I am sure that </p><p>many other publications would do well to act like- </p><p>wise. Many of your readers, no doubt, have at </p><p>some time or other perused the masterpieces of </p><p>these famous men, but the test of a classic lies in </p><p>its ability to be read and re-read with the same </p><p>degree of pleasure. If Verne’s stories are “dry </p><p>and poorly written," it is strange that they have </p><p>lived so long a time and been so immensely popu- </p><p>lar. The translation, however, into English can- </p><p>not always convey the extent of his literary ability </p><p>as does the original. </p><p> Criticism of certain scenes, as the naval battle</p><p>in "Station X", may disclose an improbability in </p><p>the assumed occurrence, but, in any story, flaws </p><p>may nearly always be picked without it losing the </p><p>charm which it holds for the reader. "Station X", </p><p>"A Columbus of Space" and "The Thing from— </p><p>Outside" seem to me to be among the test you </p><p>have printed, although a leaning towards the gro- </p><p>tesque might be discerned in the latter. </p><p> Back numbers of Dr, Hackensaw’s Secrets and</p><p>other Atories from Science and Invention, particu- </p><p>larly those of Ray Cummings should prove extreme- </p><p>ly popular. The authors most enjoyed here so </p><p>far are Serviss. Poe, and Wells. </p><p>Yours for a semi-weekly publication. </p><p> D. B. Sinclair,</p><p>. .	Winnipeg, Can.</p><p> [This interesting letter from across the border</p><p>really expresses the feeling of the Editor.

We have to strike </p><p>a good average.—Editor.] </p><p>A PROPOSED TRIP AROUND THE MOON </p><p>Editor, Amazing Stories: </p><p> I am writing you a few lines to let you know</p><p>how I feel about your Amazing Stories Magazine. </p><p>I think it is about the best book on the stand and </p><p>I wish that you would publish it oftener. </p><p> I like the stories by H.

Therefore, </p><p>as I have voted for your prize winners in your </p><p>“Prize Cover Contest” in the same order as your </p><p>committee awarded them. I will explain. </p><p> In reading these stories I began, properly, at</p><p>“the foot of the ladder’’ in order that I might gain </p><p>the right perspective in climbing up—that is. if </p><p>you had awarded the prizes corrcctly according to </p><p>my notions.	_	.</p><p> “The Fate of the Poscidonia” is an exceedingly</p><p>clever tale, highly interesting and well written— </p><p>although I believe Mrs. Harris could re-write the </p><p>first pars more emphatically and make it more con- </p><p>vincing. I enjoyed it hugely. </p><p> “The Electronic Wall” is in another class. Not</p><p>only is it a more elaborate "scientifiction.” more' </p><p>perfectly convincing in all parts, but its appeal </p><p>is deeper and more inspiring. Its motif is a hobby </p><p>of mine—of which, more, later. It completely </p><p>“carried me off my feet,” so that I had to stop </p><p>and smoke my pipe and play a game of solitaire, </p><p>before I could regain the poise to do justice to </p><p>anv other story, no matter what its merits. </p><p> But the component parts of "The Visitation” are</p><p>even more perfectly mitred in their respective con- </p><p>nections than are those of “The Electronic Wall.” </p><p>and it adheres more minutely to the details of your </p><p>cover design—and it has a similar motif. </p><p> And it is this motif in these two stories, which</p><p>I speak of last though they are first, that is my </p><p>hobby. Is is not a strange commentary upon the </p><p>genius of our race that, with mentalities capable </p><p>of soaring into the skies, we should allow our lives </p><p>and destinies to be guided and directed by a group </p><p>of grovelling grub-worms who are devoting their </p><p>undeniable talents to eternally grubbing in the </p><p>muck and mire of our financial slough for all the </p><p>gold they can steal “according to the rules of </p><p>the game 'T With the heights of comparative health </p><p>and happiness plainly visible, is it not strange that </p><p>a race with our possibilities should remain supinely </p><p>fettered by the habits, customs and superstitions </p><p>of our savage ancestry? It would seem that our </p><p>boasted civilization is but a veneer, and that, at </p><p>heart, wc are still the wild beasts from which wc </p><p>have evolutcd. </p><p> Will the presentation of scientifically possible</p><p>pictures of a better life, even though they be fan-</p><p>ciful, help *o direct the vision of our race to better </p><p>things? Is this the underlying motif behind </p><p>Amazing Stories? If so. you are attempting the </p><p>grandest “mission on earth” possible to any human </p><p>being, even though he be the perfected product of </p><p>your greatest and best and most scicntificatcd im- </p><p>agination. </p><p> E.

Wc wish </p><p>to preach the possibilities of science, and the use </p><p>of the most vivid imaginings in leading to new dis- </p><p>coveries, and to make our readers feel that there is </p><p>far more ahead of us in the way of scientific </p><p>achievement than there is in the past. Nothing </p><p>helps us on our way so much as such cheering </p><p>letters as yours. Your view of the battle waged </p><p>by mankind for gold, for money which they must </p><p>leave behind them, and often on sadly short notice, </p><p>is absolutely correct.

J </p><p> APPROVAL FROM A YOUNG READER</p><p>Editor, Amazing Stories: </p><p> I am fifteen years old and am a subscriber for</p><p>both Amazing Stories and Science Sc Invention. </p><p>I am deeply interested in chemistry, minerology </p><p>and exploration and have greatly enjoyed all the </p><p>stories except the “Moon Hoax,” which I could </p><p>not get interested enough in to finish. Some of </p><p>the stories I enjoyed the most were the "Mad </p><p>Planet” and its sequel “Red Dust”; “The Land </p><p>That Time Forgot,” “Beyond the Pole,” “Columbus </p><p>of Space” and “Station X.” I like all the stories </p><p>including the comical and gruesome because they </p><p>produce a variety of thought </p><p>Some of the critics ought to give more instructive </p><p>criticism by presenting reasonable proof along with </p><p>their statements. For instance, the criticisms on </p><p>the “Man Eating Plants" in “Through the Crater’s </p><p>Rim” unjustly call it "junk” although there are </p><p>plants that are insect traps such as the “Pitcher </p><p>Plant.” “Venus’s Fly Trap” and “Hunters Horn,” </p><p>which goes to show that man eatinj plants are not </p><p>impossible. Explorers at different timw have re-</p><p>ported animal-eating plants which could eoaeeivablv </p><p>devour a man if he were caught at a disadvantage. </p><p> I, and many others I am sur*. • would like to</p><p>see another story like “The Land that Time For- </p><p>got” in which a group of scientists are shipwraeked </p><p>on a strange island without anythisg saved and </p><p>are forced to put all their scientific knowledge of </p><p>minerology and botany to practical u»e. alto some </p><p>more stories by the author of “The Visitation” and </p><p>stories by old and foreign authors. </p><p> Kenneth L.

I was very glad that I was given </p><p>this opportunity, for I was one of the contestants. </p><p>I had a great desire to sec how others would write, </p><p>if their ideas regarding the picture were so very </p><p>different from mine. </p><p> I myself would have given the story, ‘The Visi-</p><p>tation” first place hccause it is noble in conception. </p><p>Somehow, the ending of the story made me think </p><p>of a heathenish race searching for Christ, and find- </p><p>ing him. represented by the Thon. I could not </p><p>have done better. I was sorry for Toron and </p><p>Torona and the company of one hundred that per- </p><p>ished. If I had written that story, I think I </p><p>should have let them live, at least, Toron and </p><p>Torona. Yet, it seems that for some great good, </p><p>there must be always some great sacrifice. </p><p> I was rather amused by one thing in the third</p><p>prize story. It opens in 1895, the year in which </p><p>the hero begins courting the heroine. In 1945, </p><p>fifty years later, he is still aft^r her. Must be .a </p><p>persistent fellow, I don’t sec why the woman </p><p>who wrote this story didn’t compress it into a few </p><p>months instead of scattering it through fifty years. </p><p>I believe she could have produced a greater effect </p><p>by shortening the time. And in the end he lost </p><p>her; that’s too bad, after trying for fifty years. </p><p> The reason why I like Amazing Stories is that</p><p>it makes me think. That is more than I can say </p><p>of some of the other magazines I have read. The </p><p>stories arc stimulating to the imagination; further-</p><p>more, they give one an education in scientific mat- </p><p>ters without being bone-dry reading. Since I began </p><p>reading this magazine, I have learned more of </p><p>science than I could have gotten in a year’s course </p><p>from some college text book. All in all, your </p><p>magazine is very worth while, and I hope for its </p><p>continuation. </p><p> Guy Detrick,</p><p>Big Prairie. Ohio. </p><p> fWe read between the lines that you certainly</p><p>did apnreciatc “The Visitation,” because you were </p><p>sorry for the fate of some of its charactcrs, all of </p><p>which shows that you took it to heart. You give </p><p>a real tribute to the author’s ability. The year </p><p>1895 was a misprint; it should have been 1944. So </p><p>you see he only had one year for “scattering” his </p><p>affections instead of the fifty years which the </p><p>printer has given him. If our magazine, devoted </p><p>as it is to science as well as to fiction, makes our </p><p>readers think instead of merely giving them idle </p><p>amusement, wc feel that we arc approaching our </p><p>ideal and wc highly appreciate your encouragement. </p><p>—EDITOR.] </p><p> (OPPORTUNITY AD-LETS—Continued)</p><p> $3.00 Delivered. 500 Watermarked Bond Letter-</p><p>heads 81/2 x 11 and 250 envelopes.

And since this extended part was just as</p><p> •olid as the rest, and one could not nut a hand</p><p> through the space it occupied, though invisible,</p><p> could this be explained as a magnetic wave or</p><p> wall, rather than an extension?</p><p> The experiment on the piece of steel was under-</p><p> standable. but on a human being, not so much so.</p><p> The body of man being what it Is—how could a</p><p> machine cause an increase in height of four inches,</p><p> without a corresponding decrease in atrcngth</p><p> amounting practically to helplessness? An infant's</p><p> hones are soft and pliant but it takes time to mold</p><p> even them, so what of those whose bones are hard-</p><p> ened to a certain degree of rigidity? Therefore</p><p> could a mature body stand the terrific pressure and</p><p> kneading necessary to soften the body muscles and</p><p> bones sufficiently to increase its height four inches</p><p> in almost as many minutes?</p><p> The story is unusually interesting to me as in</p><p> my childhood I had a dream of this type.</p><p> The janitor of the school 1 attended and of</p><p> whom I was rather afraid, seemed to be caught</p><p> around the chest in a common clothes wringer,</p><p> and I had to turn that wringer so it would be</p><p> around his waist so he would be able to breathe.</p><p> The ghastly agony on that man's face is with</p><p> me vet.</p><p> With all apologies for the length of this letter,</p><p> and wishing your magazine every success.</p><p> Mrs. Isla Salerno,</p><p> Chicago, 111.</p><p> I We find your criticism about the story of the</p><p> fourth dimension very amusing and suggestive, but</p><p> when you get into the fourth dimension you are</p><p> entering an unknown field and it seems to us that</p><p> you are at liberty to assign to it all sort# of qual-</p><p> ities.

Mr. Merritt surely</p><p> can keep one "up in the air.” for a long time.</p><p> There is always lots of mystery and excitement in</p><p> his stories. I also like A. Hyatt Verrill’s stories</p><p> very much.	_	.</p><p> Concerning the criticising of certain mistakes</p><p> authors make. 1 believe they make up for these in</p><p> the rest of the story. Another thing, an author</p><p> writing a story may sec a point in an altogether</p><p> different way than the one who is criticising.</p><p> Hardly any author will make a statement in a</p><p> “Scientifiction" story without being sure it can</p><p> be true, then again there is nothing told in these</p><p> stories that is grotesque and impossible enough w</p><p> that we may say it will not come true, tomorrow.</p><p> We cannot judge such things by scientific facts</p><p> that are true today because we of today do not</p><p> know all scientific possibilities and probably never</p><p> will.</p><p> Most of the stories that are written about planets</p><p> or space represent life in some human form and as</p><p> Dr. Breuer aaks in his letter in the June issue.</p><p> Why have life so human in form? Is it because</p><p> our minds refuse to judge a thing in anv other</p><p> way. but by itself? We seem to take life on other</p><p> planets on the same standards as that which exists</p><p> here. Just because life on this earth is in certain</p><p> forms, is that any reason why it should be the</p><p> same all over? What may seem lifeless or inert</p><p> on our earth could be life or something equivalent</p><p> on some other planet. Why not?</p><p> I enjoy the poems by Lcland S, Copeland and</p><p> here's hoping we may have one in every issue.</p><p> 'The Remarkable Drawing." by J. M. Dc Aragon</p><p> proved quite a surprise. I think you should in-</p><p> clude more of such drawings in Amazing Stories.</p><p> No matter how long I write, this letter would</p><p> be full of praise, for Amazing Stories fills that</p><p> long-felt want for scientifiction.</p><p> J.

All you need is a</p><p> desire to learn. Lieut. Walter Hinton,</p><p> of N.C.4 fame, and his staff of experts</p><p> will guide your instruction from be-</p><p> ginning to end.

The plots, I felt, were excellent. </p><p>“The Visitation” was fairly well written, but it </p><p>is an extremely difficult task to successfully bring </p><p>a story to a climax in the way that more expe- </p><p>rienced writers seem able to. In this respect I </p><p>feel that "The Electronic Wall," and “The Fate </p><p>of the Poseidonia” fell Hat. I. however, am </p><p>merely pointing this out. I, in spite of this, found </p><p>these stories very interesting. </p><p> Now about the other stories so far published.</p><p>In "The Mad Planet" it was pointed out that the </p><p>increased carbon dioxide content of the air caused </p><p>extraordinary fungus growths, and corresponding </p><p>insect development. Now. it is a well known fact </p><p>that fungi use the oxygen and excrete carbon </p><p>dioxide as a waste, while green plants, though they </p><p>do not require carbon dioxide, use quantities of it </p><p>in the process of photo-synthesis in excess to the</p><p>carbon dioxide excreted by the cells themselves. </p><p>Therefore, since green plants need more carbon </p><p>dioxide than oxygen, an excess of this gas in the </p><p>air would tend to stimulate green plants, and since </p><p>fungi use more oxygen than carbon dioxide, an </p><p>excess of carbon dioxide would tend to discourage </p><p>fungus growth. </p><p> In reference to insects versus mamals in a car-</p><p>bon dioxide laden atmosphere—insects breathe </p><p>through trache, air circulating without use of defi- </p><p>nite muscles or regular contractions, while ani- </p><p>mals breathe through lungs, with a definite set of </p><p>muscles. Now. it is known, and even applied (in </p><p>the case of artificial resuscitation, where carbon </p><p>dioxide is mixed in fairly large, rather, relatively </p><p>large quantities, with pure oxygen) that carbon </p><p>dioxide, when not mixed with organic impurities </p><p>(as given off by the lungs) stimulates the muscles </p><p>of the lungs. This would, in turn, speed up mam- </p><p>alian and reptilian life generally, while insects, </p><p>having no lung muscles, could not be so stimulated. </p><p>But I enjoyed the story greatly, and, as nothing </p><p>in the world is perfect. I am eagerly looking for- </p><p>ward to more stories by the author. I like all </p><p>stories, but I wish to emphasize that good author- </p><p>ship is necessary to put over an idea in an inter- </p><p>esting manner. </p><p> Also, word pictures are difficult, when of imag-</p><p>inary objects, to “get." More illustrations! </p><p> How soon semi-monthly?</p><p> P. S.—Just remembered criticism of "Green</p><p>Splotches" stating everything living has sex. Crit- </p><p>icism unfounded. Refer him to water plant Hydra, </p><p>which reproduces both sexually and unsexually. by </p><p>budding. </p><p> John Pierce,</p><p> Mason City, Iowa.</p><p> [When two readers take diametrically opposite</p><p>views of the merits of particular stories, what is </p><p>the poor editor to Jo who wants to please every- </p><p>one? This letter presents a great contrast to one </p><p>preceding it. But we do enjoy such criticisms.— </p><p>EDITOR.] </p><p>THE BELLIGERENT EDITOR </p><p>Editor. Amazing Stories: </p><p> Your magazine, since the first issue I had the</p><p>luck to pick up. has remained my favorite above </p><p>all others. Since I am continuously travelling I </p><p>do not subscribe hut I do haunt the news stands</p><p>from the fourth of the month until it appears. </p><p> My only criticism is not of the stories them-</p><p>selves but of the editorial comment that accom- </p><p>panies the letters from other readers. </p><p> For example, in the June issue the letter of</p><p>Mr. Ludes of San Francisco is treated as if he </p><p>were criticising the magazine rather than pointing </p><p>out interesting discrepancies in an otherwise ex- </p><p>cellent story. The points he mentions, particularly </p><p>the one concerning the selection of specimen in </p><p>"The Green Splotches" occurred to me at the time </p><p>I read the story. What I am trying to bring out </p><p>is the fact that discussion of this nature increases </p><p>interest in the articles themselves and, I consider, </p><p>should be treated with a less belligerent attitude </p><p>by the editors. </p><p> As for the rest I read all the stories published,</p><p>some with more pleasure than others but I always </p><p>finish the magazine from cover to cover. The </p><p>"Time Machine" has always been one of my </p><p>favorites as has the "War of the Worlds.’ The </p><p>latter seems to me to offer more possibilities for </p><p>a moving picture than "The Lost World" ever did. </p><p>I am hoping some day to find "When the Sleeper </p><p>Wakes” published as I should like to re-read it. </p><p> J.

But to come to the real</p><p>reason for this letter. In the story “Under the </p><p>Knife," by H. G.

You </p><p>see, the artist had to impersonate or represent the </p><p>narrator in some form, and wc can conceive that in </p><p>his curious and abstracted condition, so well de- </p><p>picted by the distinguished author, it was his own </p><p>imagination that seemed to eliminate his conscious- </p><p>ness of having a body.

Butler of Taft, California, in his letter</p><p>in the May issue of Amazing Stories, in attempt- </p><p>ing to belittle "The Land That Time Forgot," by </p><p>Edgar Rice Burroughs, states that it is "almost as </p><p>good as Wells’ "The Lost World." </p><p> Evidently Mr. Butler doesn't know much about</p><p>the latter book, or he wouldn’t have ascribed it to </p><p>H. G. Wells when its author is Conan Doyle. </p><p>Furthermore, his implication that Mr. Burroughs </p><p>got his idea of "Caspak" from Doyle's uninterest- </p><p>ing story is. I am quite sure, entirely unfounded. </p><p>Edgar Rice Burroughs is sccond to no one when </p><p>it comes to originality of plot. </p><p> If I were to be stranded on the "well-known</p><p>desert isle and could choose beforehand some books </p><p>to ease my exile. I would unhesitatingly select a </p><p>complete set of Edgar Rice Burroughs and settle </p><p>down to enjoy myself for the rest of my life. </p><p> AaroS* L. Glasser,</p><p>New York. N. Y. </p><p>[When our correspondent starts for the Desert </p><p>Isle with his complete set of Edgar Rice Burroughs, </p><p>if he notifies us, we will see that he is provided </p><p>with a complete set of Amazing Stories also. </p><p>Then his enjoyment will be complete.—EDITOR.] </p><p>HOW AMAZING STORIES IMPRESSES</p><p>AND AFFECTS A READER </p><p>Editor, Amazing Stories: </p><p> After your first six copies of Amazing Stories</p><p>I must write my appreciation for your magazine, </p><p>for I have delayed long enough.	. , . .</p><p>Seeing your Amazing Stories advertised in its </p><p>sister magazine, Science and Intention, I decided </p><p> ■	' .i .	_____ i .. i t L-ii.ii'i</p><p>to buy a copy of the first issue. And I haven't </p><p>missed a copy since. Your magazine is *the best </p><p>on the market of its kind today. I think. </p><p> But for everything there must be a reason. First,</p><p>I think your magazine gives as much knowledge </p><p>along scientific lines as a year's course in college. </p><p>It is so different from any other magazine on the </p><p>market, that it is a relief to buy a copy and read it. </p><p>Publishing a magazine like Amazing Stories was </p><p>the best step your company ever took in printing </p><p>reading matter for the more thinking public. This </p><p>magazine makes the reader get his mind off the </p><p>everyday hurly-burly of life and takes him into </p><p>the realms of science. Such stories as ‘¥Dff on 3 </p><p>Comet," "The Man from the Atom." "A Trip to </p><p>the Center of the Earth,” and "Station X." bring </p><p>the reader into the more intimate secrets of nature </p><p>and give him a taste of real true science. </p><p> Amazing Stories has a great uplifting effect on</p><p>the reader. The stories in thi- magazine, when </p><p>read with concentration, seem to inspire the </p><p>reader to go on and learn more of the study— </p><p>science.	. .</p><p> And to say something of the stories individu-</p><p>ally; I especially like the stories of "Off on a </p><p>Comet.” "The Man from the Atom," "A Trip to </p><p>the Center of the Earth," "The Infinite Vision." </p><p>"Station X,” "The Moon Metal," and "The </p><p>Malignant Entity.” The other stories which were </p><p>very good were the stories by Edgar Allan Poe </p><p>and the stories of "The Scientific Adventures of </p><p>Mr. Fosdick.” *‘Dr. Hackcnsaw's Secrets” is most </p><p>interesting too. </p><p> I like stories which deal in radio and later day</p><p>science. "Station X” appealed to me very highly, </p><p>because it dealt with my hobby, which is radio. </p><p>I also like stories of chemistry and stories of as- </p><p>tronomy. </p><p> I am verv much in favor of having Amazing</p><p>Stories published twice each month, even though I </p><p>didn’t take time to send in my vote. It seems so </p><p>long to wait a whole month for the best reading </p><p>material on the market to get here. Why not </p><p>make it a "twice monthly?" </p><p> Just print more stories of radio and television</p><p>and print the magazine twice each month then I’ll </p><p>be entirely satisfied. </p><p> John M. Stern,</p><p> Hayti. Mo.</p><p> [So far it has not been practical to issue Amaz-</p><p>ing Stories twice a month. Certain mechanical </p><p>difficulties are still in the way. However, it is </p><p>possible-that after the magazine has become estab- </p><p>lished it will become a semi-monthly.—EDITOR.J </p><p>“We pay him </p><p>$100 a week” </p><p> «*/4ND he’s worth every cent of it.
