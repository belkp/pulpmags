O'Conor Sloane, Ph.D.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT is not safe at the present day to be incredulous about what</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind is going to da in the near future. Professor Simon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Newcomb, who died in the year 1909, and who was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leading astronomers of the world, announced his firm</seg><seg type="columnLine">belief that flying in a heavier-than-air machine was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossibility and would never be achieved by man. Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Langley, another of the world's great scientists, distinguished for</seg><seg type="columnLine">liis researches on stellar heat, the inventor of the bolometer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made fruitless experiments in flying and suffered much unfavor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able comment and ridicule for his efforts. According to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories, he died largely of a broken heart bccausc he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">achieve success. And now, when a flight is made across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American Continent in a little over half a day, it is amazing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of what progress was made in the last twenty years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In early days, the Wright biplane, with its comparatively slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolving propellers and its clumsy chain drive, was really the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominent flying machine and could go perhaps thirty or forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles an hour. All the machines of that date were so slow that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind was a hazard, and students of aviation used to employ the</seg><seg type="columnLine">early morning hours, about sunrise, for their praciicc, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was the calmest period of the day. The crossing oÂ£ the</seg><seg type="columnLine">British Channel by Bleriot in an airplane from France to Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land was considered one of the great achievements of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">early days and was commemorated by a monument showing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where he landed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now aviators are considering the possibility of crossing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">channel in a glider with no engine!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It is fair to say that no invention of man has paralleled that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flying in its development in the comparatively short time of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty years, for the last two decades have given airplanes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">range of flight about two hundred times greater than the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempts, and a rate of speed ten times that of the old Wright</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine. A flight with one passenger was something to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked about in those days. Today, one hundred people are con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered a quite possible load for an airplane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And we have now arrived at a point of scientific development</seg><seg type="columnLine">when seemingly wild predictions might be safely indulged in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor John Q. Stewart, Associate Professor of Astro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomical Physics in Princeton University, before the members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, declared that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his belief that in another twenty years airplanes will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">attained a speed of 1000 miles per hour. This is only three</seg><seg type="columnLine">times the maximum speed of the present, which is ten times</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed of the early practical airplanes. It seems entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonable that a speed of 1000 miles per hour will he attained</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before the tune limit set by Prof. Stewart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But our professor goes further. lie believes that in the not</seg><seg type="columnLine">very distant future--specifically he names the year 2050-sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed will be realized to make possible succcssful flights to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon. Other difficulties exist for such trips, of course but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prof. Stewart, among others, docs not think they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">insurmountable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a height of five or six miles, the strain on an aviator is</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost unendurable, as the cold and rarefaction of the air are</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely trying. Artificial heat, of course, could be provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some provision could probably be made to supply air for</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing. Both of these would be absolutely necessary for inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary travel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only kind of airship which we know of now that might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be used for trips through space is the reaction ship, driven on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the principle of the rocket. It is hard to see what other method</seg><seg type="columnLine">of propulsion could be used in the vacuum, which would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached a few miles above the surface of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And here we find a double factor. The resistance to forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion in an airplane is due. of course, to the air. The famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris gun, which bombarded Paris from a distance of 75 miles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able to do so largely because it shot its projectiles to a height</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 24 miles, where there was a very slight air resistance to oppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forward motion. This must also apply to interplanetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once an interplanetary ship reached a height of twenty-five to</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty miles from the earth, it could cut down its power as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as forward progress is concerned. After a while, gravity too</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be diminished to the vanishing point, and a minimum</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantity of fuel would be required to keep the ship going. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a region where gravitation would not be felt, on account of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">relative distances, as it might be from the moon and the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would seem that once any desired speed was reached, the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be shut off and the ship could go on almost indefinitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">without consuming fuel.

It was the nearest planet to Sonko-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huara--near, however, only by comparison--and sep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arated by some forty-odd million Tuppus (miles) of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. Yet through the ages the astronomers of Sonko-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huara had learned much about their great, glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbor, that, like their own planet, raced about the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rotated upon its own axis, so that the Sonko-Huaran</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists knew that the seasons, the climate, the alternat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing days and nights of Suari must be very similar to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through their telescopes the astronomers of ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">times had studied Suari; they had viewed its surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">from pole to pole and completely around its circumfer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, for unlike Quilla (the moon), that presented only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side to view as far as Suari is concerned, Suari pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented every portion of its surface to the eyes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">studious and curious inhabitants of Sonko-Huara.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Often, however, strange masses of dense vapor obscured</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big planet.

Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">always there were certain portions of its surface that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were free from the vapor.

Through the ages, too, much had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been learned of the surface of Suari. Over two-thirds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planet was covered with water (an amazing dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery for the Sonko-Huarans whose planet was woe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully short of water and was, with the exception of polar</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas and inland seas, all land). Vast mountain ranges,</seg><seg type="columnLine">great canals (crooked and winding in most remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner) had been studied and mapped; immense masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ice had been seen to cover the polar regions, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomers were both astonished and puzzled to note</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the appearance of the land masses changed continu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally. At times they were white, at others brown, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">others green. Gradually they noticed that these altera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions followed a regular sequence, that they were re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated at fixed intervals and that they bore a direct rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive beings they must be to till the soil and raise</seg><seg type="columnLine">crops industries that had been abandoned, forgotten by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sonko-Huarans countless ages ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Discussions ran high as to what these dwellers on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other planet might be like.

Gradually the other planet had been brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">visually closer.

Suddenly the Sonko-Huaran astronomers had had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspiration. Their neighboring planet must be inhabited!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It must be populated by intelligent beings not unlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves! The change in colors must be the result of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these beings cultivating the land!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Sonko-Huaran astronomers, the scientists, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the common people became greatly excited and intensely</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested in this theory.

It had been a still more epochal dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery when an astronomer of Sonko-Huara had seen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">city on the other planet. With cach new discovery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this sort, each announcement that there was some new</seg><seg type="columnLine">and indisputable proof of the existence of sentient, intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligent beings 011 Suari, eilorts to obtain a more intimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge had been redoubled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ages before the return of Kespi-Nanay, after his mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious absencc, the surface of Suari had been brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">optically within a few thousand miles of Sonko-Huara.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was by this time an established fact that the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet was thickly populated by some sort of intelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings. They had cities, towns, lights. They moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from place to place. They dug canals, they leveled moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains, they transformed the surface of their lands over</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast areas. Yet all the constant minute studies devoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them tended more and more to prove to the inhabi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tants of Sonko-Huara that their neighbors forty million</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles away were immeasurably backward and behind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, that, assuming them to be in the least similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sonko-Huarans, they were more or less in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of civilization as the inhabitants of Sonko-Huara</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been in their prehistoric days. Their stupidity, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumed through reasoning and experiments, was abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely astounding. Not only was it evident that they still</seg><seg type="columnLine">made use of the archaic method of obtaining foods and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other necessities by agriculture, but in addition their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities, as far as could be determined, were marvelous ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amples of the survival of ancient, long-abandoned bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And despite every effort on the part of the denizens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sonko-Huara, the unintelligent creatures on Suari</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to respond to the plain and simple signals that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been devised to attract their attentions. The simplest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most readily read messages had been formed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of Sonko-IIuara and had been displayed day</seg><seg type="columnLine">after day when the two planets were nearest to each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, yet there had been no response, no answering sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nals. To be sure, the watchers load noticed strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses and groups of lights, but they were meaningless;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they conveyed nothing and it was decided they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely to illuminate some great gathering of the Suarans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN had comc the strange, mysterious but wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">undecipherable sounds that had first been detected</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reported by Kespi-Nanay, the greatest of living sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">entists on Sonko-Huara. That they came from Suari,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was convinced, and despite the scoffs of fellow scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tists, he boldly declared his conviction that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">signals of some sort, sent out by the dwellers on Suari.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pointed out that the sounds were articulate, that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not mechanical and hence must have originated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throat of some living creature. He also proved that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same sounds were constantly repeated with carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">timed intervals between each series of sounds. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was derided, ridiculed when he promulgated the theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">that beings on Suari--especially such barbarous, primi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive, stupid beings as all agreed they must be--could</seg><seg type="columnLine">project their voices across millions of miles of space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even the Sonko-Huarans could not perform any such</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat and--asked one of the news-dispersers--if Kespi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nanay deemed the sounds to Ik; voices, why, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior knowledge, could he not interpret the words?</seg><seg type="columnLine">But despite the fact that Kespi's theories and beliefs</seg><seg type="columnLine">found few followers, interest, that had flagged for years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was revived, and once more Suari became the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all interest, all speculations, all studies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Various wild schemes were suggested for visiting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other planet. Learned scientists spent days and weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">in abstruse calculations to prove that a trip to Suari was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, scientifically speaking, impossible. All the ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced knowledge of the inventors and scientists was</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed in trying to devise some means for making the</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey. There were gravitationally impelled machines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines that were designed to be hurled into space by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rotational movement of the planet, machines of end-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less types. Yet in every case there was some impedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, some fatal fault that proved conclusively that none</seg><seg type="columnLine">would serve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite the logical warnings of the experts, several</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually were tried. One machine, impelled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of a decomposing atom, left the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. It gathered speed so swiftly that it became in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible, but, a few moments later, a terrific explosion in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper atmosphere told the anxious and hopeful</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchers of its fate. Another machine, designed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eliminate gravity as was done in the case of the ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines used for every-day travel, but with devices to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enable it to fly off at a tangent by the momentum of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet's rotation, became incandescent and was trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed to gas by its friction through the upper air. Still</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, by far the largest and most carefully planned</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all, was impelled and controlled by the recently dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered Ethmic force and succeeded in winning clear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sonko-Huara's atmospheric envelope. For the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-four hours its progress through space was</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched with bated breaths, and it seemed as if at last a</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful voyage to Suari was to be accomplished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, about the thirtieth hour, it was seen that the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine's course had changed. It was veering away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orbit of Suari and presently, to the horror of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sonko-Huarans, it was determined that beyond any pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility of doubt the apparatus had become a satellite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet and was doomed forever to move around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the sphere like an attendant moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, when everyone had given up all ideas of ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">being able to visit the fascinatingly mysterious Suari,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kespi-Nanay had come out with his absolutely astound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing statements. Matter, he declared, was all imaginary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It did not actually exist. It was merely a combination or</seg><seg type="columnLine">grouping of protons and electrons. This was by no</seg><seg type="columnLine">means a new theory. In fact, generations before Kespi</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been incubated and brought into existence, other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sonko-Huaran scientists had promulgated exactly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same theory. But nothing had ever come of it, no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever been able conclusively to prove it. But Kespi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nanay claimed he could; he averred he had; and he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted that his discovery paved the way to visit Suari and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to return in safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Naturally he once more became the target of derision,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridicule, jokes and incredulity. To do a thing was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough; the important matter was to convince others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Achievement amounts to nothing unless the public ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mits the fact of that achievement. Kespi was deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined that his astonishing achievement should be ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he announced that he would give a public demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stration of the truth of his claims. His promise was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than fulfilled. Before a vast gathering--in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before all the inhabitants, for by means of the univer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sally employed vision-disseminators or Muri-Willyas, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstration was visible everywhere upon the planet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kespi-Nanay caused a cube of metal, a tablet of Chocli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hanca or concentrated food, and even a Pilcu bird (the</seg><seg type="columnLine">A VISIT TO SUARI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">295</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">only wild fowl on Sonko-Huara) to vanish before every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's eyes. Then, as the people listened most attentively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stated that he had gone further with his experiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he had revealed hitherto. Not only, he informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, was matter merely the result of certain arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of protons and electrons, each form of matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">so-called being the result of slightly varying combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, any or all of which might at will be broken up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the independent quanta and so rendered invisible; but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went on, the same electrons could, by properly devised</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments and treatment, be summoned back into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">original places with the protons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At these words an exclamation of incredulity arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from thousands of lips. It might be possible--in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was possible, as they had seen--that matter could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to disappear. It was not so very remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all, they decided, for water was matter and yet it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be made to evaporate and vanish. Moruli was</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, yet it could be consumed by flame and made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanish without leaving a trace of ashes. But that mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, once it had vanished, could be restored to its original</seg><seg type="columnLine">state was too incredible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next moment they began to have their doubts as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their conviction. Kespi, as if reading their thoughts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was speaking of these very things. Water, he was point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out, could be recovered--was not this precisely what</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened daily? Did the sun not evaporate water, cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to vanish? Most assuredly. Yet did that water not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall again as rain? And salts, dissolved in water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hence destroyed as matter in their particular forms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, as all knew, be readily recovered. Why then, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded them, was it so incredible to believe that metal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">living flesh--any object--could not be reformed by sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moning the protons and electrons, of which such matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been composed, and forcing them to group them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves as in the first place?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly had he spoken when, by seemingly magical</seg><seg type="columnLine">means, the cube of metal, the heap of food, the bird were</seg><seg type="columnLine">once again before him--conjured from nothingness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A deafening roar of approbation and applause greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his demonstration and drowned his next words. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">order and silence had been restored, he made bis most</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishing statement of all. Not only could an object</seg><seg type="columnLine">be restored, rebuilt from its original protons and elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trons, but he informed the amazed people it could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebuilt in a totally different locality from that in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been disintegrated. And to prove this incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement, he proceeded to cause the three objects to van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish and to reappear almost instantaneously several hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet distant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The people by this time were beyond expressing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder. Rut still more astonishing things were to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">vouchsafed them. "My discovery," observed Kespi,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"will be the means of solving that ages-old problem of</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a visit to Suari. Because, my friends, whereas</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, as we know it, may not travel through space by</seg><seg type="columnLine">any known means--and if it were possible for it to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">so ages would be required for it to traverse such a Tuppu</seg><seg type="columnLine">as separates us from Suari--the constituent electrons</seg><seg type="columnLine">and protons of matter can traverse space unharmed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such extreme speed that they may be said to travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantaneously. Hence an object may be reduced to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">free quanta or portions here 011 Sonko-Huara and within</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inconceivably short time afterwards they may be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembled in the original material form on Suari or else-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. Distance, space has no effect upon them. Ah,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you ask, how do I know this? By reasoning, by logic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the unalterable laws of the universe," he exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I can assure you that I can make this metallic cube van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish, and before you have realized it has gone, it will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its original form somewhere upon the surface of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Suari. But-" with a laugh, "of course it might be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the waters of that planet, and equally, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you could not see such a small object on distant Suari,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hence I could not prove my claims. But"--his tones</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so impressive, so earnest that everyone awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathlessly for his next words--"but," he repeated, "so</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure am I of my deductions, so convinced that my rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soning is correct, that I plan to test the matter on my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Tomorrow I shall cause myself to be disintegrated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and--if all goes well--shall cause myself to be reassem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled upon Suari. In other words, I shall be transported</seg><seg type="columnLine">--not as a body of matter but as countless trillions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">electronic and protonic units--through forty million</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tuppus of space and will find myself in material form</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon that mysterious planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," he smiled, "I run a slight risk. I, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metallic cube, might be reassembled in the water. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be reformed in some other equally unpleasant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatal situation. But that is a chance I must take. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise of the adventure is worth risks. Personally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, I do not foresee any such difficulties. My ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periments have proved to my own satisfaction that 1 can</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause an object, reduced to its constituent electrons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">protons, to form again within a very restricted area, pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined by myself. I have selected the area on Suari,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, if all goes well, I shall be reformed. It is a spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is somewhat remote from the strange collections of</seg><seg type="columnLine">structures, which we assume to be refuges of the Suari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ans, and in an area that--not having presented the alter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nating colors indicating the presence of living beings--</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, we assume, uninhabited. I do not"--he smiled--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"particularly desire to appear suddenly and as if by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">supernatural means in the immediate vicinity of a Sua-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rian or of several Suarians. We may feel fairly certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our observations and studies that they are a primi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive, backward and not over-intelligent lot, and probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore as superstitious and as readily startled as were</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own ancestors in the remote past when they, too, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended upon the cultivation of the soil for their liveli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood. I might be struck down--even devoured by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures before I had an opportunity to make my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly intentions and my physical actuality understood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, as we have no conception of the physical pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culiarities of the inhabitants of Suari, I might, and prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably would, appear as a strange, bizarre and monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature to them. Naturally wc assume that, as Suari is</seg><seg type="columnLine">many times the bulk of Sonko-Huara, its inhabitants</seg><seg type="columnLine">will lie proportionately gigantic, and hence I would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely at their mercy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But"--with a sigh--"I shall take the risks. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest fear is that T may not find it possible to return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Sonko-Huara. Conditions on Suari may preclude the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility of my reversing the process by which I leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and reappear on Suari. Naturally I shall take my</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments with me, but atmospheric, elcctrical, gravi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tational--a thousand conditions--may interfere with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their proper operation on that planet. However, we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no reason to think that such conditions are not very simi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar to our own. The examinations and tests we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to make convince us of that. So, my friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fellow Sonko-Huarans, tomorrow at the time of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kora-Ma. when Suari is nearest to us in its orbit, I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">296</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cause myself to vanish. I may never return or again I</seg><seg type="columnLine">may reappear among you at any time. But if I do not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my loss will amount to little, whereas if I do, I shall have</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned the truth of our neighboring planet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KESPI had kept his word. In sight of all, at the hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Kora-Ma, he had bade the public farewell and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant later, he and his compact instruments had van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished before their eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, three Chukitis after that dramatic disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance, Kespi-Nanay had returned!

The old fellow had been in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">specting the local vitamin plant near Ir-Chu when a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound had attracted him, and wheeling about, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kespi-Nanay standing almost by his side. But as fear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fright, superstition and the sensation of being startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, ages before, been lost to the Sonko-Huarans, Mic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chu-Tay had merely expressed mild astonishment, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly had sent the news flying throughout the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of the thought disseminator, which he, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone else, carried always with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, Kespi-Nanay had unquestionably returned.

At last, after ages of surmises, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">studies, of deductions, none of which had answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzle, the truth of Suari and its denizens would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned. No one doubted for a moment that Kespi had</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually visited the other planet. His demonstrations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three years earlier, had removed all doubts as to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim, and while everyone had long since come to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusion that he had either failed to materialize on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suari or, having materialized thereon, had been de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed or had been unable to return, the fact that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned convinced them that his amazing undertaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a complete success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A universal holiday had been announced, to continue</seg><seg type="columnLine">until Kespi had completed his narrative. But this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">really superfluous, for 110 one would have attended to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">or her duties anyway and. moreover, the Apus and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amautus, even the Tarancas, could be counted on to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">present to hear and see the returned interplanetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanderer, and without them the public would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">as helpless and as futile in accomplishment as an ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">without its antennae.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hence practically every being on Sonko-Huara gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">undivided attention to Kespi-Nanay when he entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great auditorium of Muru-Ti and, seating himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the Amautu-Ka and the Apu-Inki, proceeded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell his fellow Sonko-Huarans of his amazing and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible discoveries and experiences on Suari. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">often, as he spoke, his listeners unconsciously and in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">voluntarily glanced, half-fearfully, at the great golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemisphere of Suari in the sky, as if actually expecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see some of the strange beings or marvelous sights</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Kespi-Nanay was describing. "As you all know,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began, "I caused my material body, together with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments, to be disintegrated here three Chukitis ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of that disruption of my protonic and electronic com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponent parts, or of my instantaneous flight through space</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have no recollections. I have a dim memory, like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an evasive dream, of strange sensations, of whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly like a bit of dust. But my next actual concrete</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation, after I turned on my disintegrating and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jecting device, was one of standing in a strange place. T</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt so natural, so precisely as if nothing had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, for a fleeting moment, I feared nothing had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, that my experiment had failed. But a glance at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my surroundings reassured me. Nothing was familiar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Never had I imagined such a spot. I was standing 011 a</seg><seg type="columnLine">far-reaching area of rocky sand. Above me was the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, and across it stretched masses of the same white</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor we have seen so often about Suari. Also, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sky, was Quilla, but appearing very small and far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On one side rose high, bare mountains, on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plain stretched to the horizon, and within a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance of where 1 stood I saw an amazing sight. There,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at me, curiously but apparently unafraid, and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even surprised, were a number of the inhabitants of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. Never had I seen such impossible creatures. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sonko-Huaran imagination could have conceived of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings, and even if I describe them to you, my friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you cannot picture them to yourselves. They were brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">or black, shaggy-skinned and stood on four legs. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">necks were long, thin and bore elongated heads with im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense ears and large dark eyes. They appeared intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent, and judging that they must be more intelligent than</seg><seg type="columnLine">we of Sonko-Huara had thought, I addressed them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently heard my words, for they moved their ears, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they made no reply. Of course 1 was not surprised. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hardly expected that the Suarians would understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">our language. So I made signals, but the Suarians</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed no signs of understanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They appeared peaceful and quite harmless, so cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously I approached them. I was quite close to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they turned abruptly and moved off. Evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were suspicious of me, and desiring to let them know</seg><seg type="columnLine">I intended 110 harm, I spoke again. This time they</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned about and took a few steps in my direction. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">delighted. I felt that they must understand my tones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if not the meaning of my words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then a most amazing thing happened. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature appeared from behind a rock. He was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller than the first inhabitants and he stood upon two</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs! Ah, I know you will find it hard to credit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement, but it is the truth. And you can find it 110 more</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult to believe, as I tell it, than I found it, as I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. A living intelligent being on two feet like a bird, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other living intelligent beings 011 four feet! Obviously</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had never guessed the truth, Suari was inhabited by</seg><seg type="columnLine">two forms of beings, and I wondered if it could be pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible both were the same species--if one were male, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other female or if one was the young of the other. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two-legged creature differed in every respect from</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of four legs. He, too, I noticed, possessed four</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs but he stood on but two and used the other two for</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasping objects, as we use our members, whereas the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures on four legs possessed no limbs for grasping.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A VISIT TO SUARI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">297</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, the two-legged being was red in color, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin appeared to hang in loose folds from his neck, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet his limbs were of a different brown color and of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct texture. Neither was his neck long nor his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head elongated. On the contrary, he had scarcely any</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck. Ilis head was round but rose to a point at the top;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears were deformed until they were scarcely more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than orifices; he had no horns; liis eyes were but two in</seg><seg type="columnLine">number, and in the front of his head; the rear portion</seg><seg type="columnLine">being covered with a rough wool or fur; and his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed no tusks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He stared at me for a space and then spoke, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my astonishment I found I could comprehend his words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though they were different from our own. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered that he asked who I ftas arid whence I came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So I replied that my name was Kespi-Nanay and that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from Sonko-Huara. His mouth widened in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most remarkable manner; he appeared to understand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But all this time I was filled with astonishment. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not appear to be terrified or even amazed at my appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, as I had expccted he would be at seeing for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time a visitor from another sphere. Surely. I thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my form--I glanced down at myself and gasped in utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement. I was not myself. I had but two legs, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms! Half-fearfully I raised my hand to my head. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns had vanished, my soft pendant ears had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, my magnificent tusks no longer protruded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my lips, my tentacular antennae were missing! Fur, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">scales, covered my head, my ears were mere holes; in</seg><seg type="columnLine">short I was the exact counterpart of the two-legged crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture before me. I was dumbfounded. I felt as if in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream. Then suddenly, I understood. The constituent</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrons of my being, when reassembled with my pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons upon Suari, had produced my material body in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of a Suarian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a contingency I had not foreseen; yet, now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered it, it seemed perfectly natural. The condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of Suari that had resulted in the molding of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">puny, underdeveloped, physically imperfect beings as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature before me (and myself) controlled the combin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the electrons and forced them to produce Suarian</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms. No doubt, I decided, were a Suarian to 1* trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported to Sonko-Huara by the methods I had used, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be materialized in the form of a Sonko-Huaran.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I was thankful that I had assumed the form of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-legged inhabitant rather than that of the beings with</seg><seg type="columnLine">four legs, who--though they appeared far more intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent--seemed dumb, for as yet they had uttered no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. I was astonished also that I could converse with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange creature of the two legs. For a space I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that possibly the same laws and conditions that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had so altered my body to a Suarian form had affected</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind and my speech to a similar extent. But no, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words the other being used were so familiar, so nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">identical with those of my own tongue, I cast aside that</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory. By some amazing coincidence, or for some un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known reason which I might yet discover, there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very close relationship between the two languages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T)UT my speculations on such matters were inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">-D rupted by the appearance of two more lyings. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">was precisely like the first two-legged being, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite different. The head was similar, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors of the strangely loose skin were brilliant and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature appeared to have no legs, the body extending in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a solid mass to within a short distance of the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was the more remarkable as the being possessed feet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that appeared to move back and forth under the solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">body in a most amazing manner. It was not until much</seg><seg type="columnLine">later that I learned that this being was the female of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others and that it actually possessed legs, which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealed by artificial layers of skin that the Suarians call</seg><seg type="columnLine">'clothes.' In fact, T found to my astonishment that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loose, bright-colored coverings I had seen were arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial and that the true skin fitted the body closely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very smooth, soft and pleasing in shade, although, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shall explain, the tint ranged from a very dark, black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish-brown to almost pure white, a truly remarkable con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition. It was also, I learned, considered very wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a proof of barbarism to appear without the arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial skin over one's body, and the beings I first met,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at me and uttered strange sounds with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouths widely open, because I was not provided with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such coverings. Presently, however, the creature, who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found later was the female spoke to one of the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">who pulled a portion of the coverings from his own per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and placed it over me. The others added more pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I was covered similarly to themselves. To me these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things were most uncomfortable, feeling very rough and</seg><seg type="columnLine">irritating to my body, and I would have liked to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast them off. But I wished to remain on friendly terms</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the strange beings and (at the time) thinking it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps a rite or ceremony indicative of friendship, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore the discomfort. Why these beings of Suari should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have developed such habits is beyond me. Their bodies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly and deformed as they were, were far more sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">metrical and admirable without the artificial coverings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I was not so much surprised when, later, I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some such protection was required for the creatures'</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies, their skins being most tender and easily injured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not being guarded like our own by strong scales that are</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced by new growths when injured. In fact, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">juries which we would consider slight often caused the</seg><seg type="columnLine">total disability or death of these Suarians. for they are so</seg><seg type="columnLine">low in the scale of nature and so primitive in their de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopment, that they cannot replace even a lost append-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age or limb with new growths like ourselves. Moreover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although the variations in their climate are not as great as</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Sonko-Huara, yet as these miserable beings do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">alter their natural bodies to suit conditions, but remain al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways the same, they are, perforce, compelled to adapt</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to the weather by varying the artificial skins</seg><seg type="columnLine">or 'clothing'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But to return to the strange beings I first met. Hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing been covered with the objects, as I have stated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus made to appear even more like the three creatures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they seemed to he more friendly, and one of them did a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most astounding thing. He produced a peculiar object</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he inserted in his mouth. Then, to my unbounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment, he magically caused fire to spring into</seg><seg type="columnLine">being in his hand, and placing the flame against the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject in his mouth, he breathed in the fire and emitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke from his nostrils. Never would I have believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a feat possible had I not witnessed it with my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, yet the others appeared not to be surprised. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact they also produced their own fire-machines and soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">all three were breathing fire. I noticed, however, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tour-legged beings did not do so, which convinced me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were the superior beings and that the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were probably servants or inferiors. Yet this thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled me, for in that case I had been reformed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suari not as the superior hut as the inferior type, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would indicate that the Sonko-Huarans were inferior to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Suarians. But I had little time to dwell on this, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">298</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the two-legged creatures was offering me a fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine. I drew back in horror at the thought of breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flame, but the being appeared so perturbed by my act</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, feeling I must use every care to retain their friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship if I were to learn all 1 desired of their ways, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned all my courage and placed the machine in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. To my surprise there was no fire nor heat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I carefully breathed in smoke, the sensation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not unpleasant, although it caused me to cough and choke</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat. Obviously, I concluded, this breathing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke was a ceremony, perhaps indicative of friendship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for presently the three laid aside their machines, as 1 did</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine, without as far as I could determine having ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complished anything. But, I thought, if this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom is universal among the Suarians (as I found later</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was) and if the planet was thickly inhabited, it ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained the masses of vapor that hung above Suari's</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface and had so greatly puzzled us of Sonko-Huara.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Having ended the smoke ceremony, the three rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from where they had been seated, and inviting me to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">company them, they moved forward. To my amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, the four-legged beasts moved with them. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two-legged creatures appeared to command the</seg><seg type="columnLine">obedience of the superior four-legged creatures, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the latter were far larger and stronger than those</seg><seg type="columnLine">with two legs, they made no resistance, even when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others struck them with rods to urge them onwards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now my mind was quite upset, for here was proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">that those I had mistaken for inferior beings were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior inhabitants of Suari. However, it made me</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel a bit easier, for it proved that the form I had as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed was that of the superior beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Presently we approached some great masses of stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were in ruins, but which it was evident had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">erected by living beings, and I stopped and stared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredulous eyes, for upon one of the stones was carved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the figure of a Sonko-Huaran! It was quite unmistakable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The numerous appendages and tentacles, the horns, tusks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lobe-like ears, even the scales and other details were dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinct. What did it mean? Were there beings like our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves upon Suari--perhaps the rulers of the planet!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I turned to one of the two-legged creatures and asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. For a moment he seemed puzzled. Then he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied that the figure on the stone had been there always,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in past ages it had been adored by his ancestors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and regarded as a god. I asked him if similar beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived near and at that he and his companions made</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange bellowing sounds and their mouths opened until</seg><seg type="columnLine">their short useless teeth were exposed, and they said</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no such creatures in existence, even if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever had been in the past. I told them they were quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong; that upon my planet all beings were of that sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that I myself was the same when on Sonko-Huara.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They regarded me with most peculiar expressions, ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously with unbelief, and presently again gave way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their strange sounds, which I may as well explain were</seg><seg type="columnLine">their indications of derision and hilarity. Evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">they thought my words were a great joke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS we continued on our way, my mind was busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering: if there were no Sonko-Huarans on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suari, how could the inhabitants ages before have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar with the appearance of our race? Then I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the ancient legend of our people, wherein it is told</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great Apu named Pakak produced magic, and to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">his enemies, flew with his followers from Sonko-Huara</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vanished forever. Was it not possible that there was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">truth in the tale and that Pakak and his fellows might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have reached Suari? I do not know, but throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">the portion of Suari where first I arrived 1 found many</seg><seg type="columnLine">images and statues of the Sonko-Huaran forms, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the traditions of the people, there was a being they called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pachak. But I had so many other strange and astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing things to interest me that I gave little thought to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculations. We soon came to a deep valley and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brown earth was hidden under rich green, and water</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowed in canals as it does on Sonko-IIuara. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canals were tiny affairs and the green was, as we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ago surmised, the color of the vegetation of Suari.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the valley also, was the collection of structures wherein</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Suarians dwelt, for incredible as it may seem, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings dwell in cubicles^losely placed in groups and herd</seg><seg type="columnLine">together like swarms of insects. Their strange reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">for so doing I learned later and I will leave the explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion until I speak of the larger groups of structures that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I visited subsequently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In this first group were hordes of the two-legged</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures, males, females and young, but no two exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">alike, for not only do the Suarians vary individually, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I found later, there are many races of them, varying</seg><seg type="columnLine">in color, in size and in every respect, even as to intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence and culture--all working at cross-purposes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even fighting with one another. But in this first place I</seg><seg type="columnLine">visited all were of one color or nearly so and of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">race, although their artificial skins varied in color and</seg><seg type="columnLine">form.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Also, to my amazement, I discovered that the four-</seg><seg type="columnLine">legged beasts were not artificially covered, but that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaggy coverings actually grew upon them, yet they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">inferior creatures and mere slaves of the two-legged</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings. More surprising still, I found that these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the only slaves. There were giant creatures with</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns upon their heads; there were smaller beings with</seg><seg type="columnLine">immensely large ears and big heads that served the two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">legged creatures as beasts of burden; there were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller four-legged Suarians that possessed sharp teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that appeared savage and uttered sharp barking</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds when strangers approached, but were docile with</seg><seg type="columnLine">those they knew; and there were many other four-legged</seg><seg type="columnLine">things as well as hosts of birds larger than the Pilcus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All of these I learned were kept in captivity by the two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">legged beings and were forced to labor for them, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was most strange, for many were superior in intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in senses to their stupid and backward masters. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though you may not believe it, yet it is a fact that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-legged inhabitants of Suari--men and women as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are called--are so deficient in sense development that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot see scent nor sound; they cannot hear light nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent, and they cannot smell sound nor light. Their eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which they have but two, are used only for seeing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is the result of light waves. Their ears, which are</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere holes in their heads, are useful only in detecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound vibrations, and their noses which also are holes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads, can only detcct odors. Moreover, being thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">deficient and unable to use their three sense organs in</seg><seg type="columnLine">unison or to substantiate one another, the Suarians are</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamentably deficient in sight, hearing and scent. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their captive creatures arc far superior to them in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">respects, and it is a most amazing fact that the so-called</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior beings actually keep the so-called inferior</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures (especially those with the sharp teeth and bark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sounds) because the latter possess keener sight, hear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and scent than their masters and hence serve as</seg><seg type="columnLine">additional ears, noses and eyes and warn their masters</seg><seg type="columnLine">A VISIT TO SUARI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">299</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of many events and perils of which otherwise they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be ignorant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, being materialized in the form of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suarian, 1 was to a great extent like them, but in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind and my senses I had not changed, and though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alteration in the structure of my eyes, ears and nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendered me less sensitive than normally and though lack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my horns I could not receive thought messages--still</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could detect many things that the Suarians could not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For example, I was aware that the various four-legged</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures were conversing among themselves, and while</seg><seg type="columnLine">T could not understand their languages, it proved how</seg><seg type="columnLine">degenerate and undeveloped were the two-legged people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for in all my travels I found none who could hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices of the fonr-legged creatures when they conversed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in normal tones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I first reached the abiding place of the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings I had met on the plain, I found many of the fe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">males performing mysterious rites over fires.

Yet even so the waste is so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stupendous that, within a short time, the Suarians will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have exhausted the life essentials of their planet and will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perish miserably from their own lack of foresight, if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they do not advance and improve intellectually to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">point reached by our forefathers countless ages ago.

Partially these variations are due to race, partly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they are due to climate, partly to surroundings, but very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">largely to the fact that the Suarians, no matter of what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">race, learn only by example, by being taught by others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They have no instinctive knowledge and the offspring of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the most intelligent and advanced, if reared apart or amid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the inferior members of the population, reach maturity as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stupid and backward as the offspring of those about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">On the other hand, the young of interior and unintelli-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gent beings, if reared and taught by those of the superior</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">classes, may and often do, excel their mentors in attain-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There has been some effort made to bring about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a general and universal improvement of the population</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by a system of education, but it has amounted to very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little as far as I could judge by even careful study and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">observation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Mingled with the other strange and paradoxical fea-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tures of these beings is a curious feeling of independence,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a desire for personal liberty that, considering the con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ditions that exist, is most amusing.

This came about through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arrival of a remarkable being in the community where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had first arrived. He came across the plain, a gigantic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">four-legged creature with two bodies and heads, the most,</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrifying monster it is possible to imagine. One body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rough, hairy, immense, with a heavy neck fringed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with long hair, and bearing a great bony head with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed cars, staring eyes, snorting nostrils and great yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low teeth. The other body resembled that of the two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">legged beings but sprouted from the larger body's back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It bore two arms and a small round head with features</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat like those of the men I had seen, but covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with dark fur, and with the skin, where it showed, a pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culiar pink. The monster came rushing onwards and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my amazement the beings of the place showed no fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor did they endeavor to flee from the fury and destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the oncoming creature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Had I not been of Sonko-Huara I should have sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety in flight, though so swift was the pace of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that it would have been hopeless. Even as it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt dread, yet I stood my ground, and was still more</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed to observe that the four-legged things, even those</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller ones with the sharp teeth and yelping voices, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not dash away in terror. On the contrary they ran snap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping at the monster who made no attempt to destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The next moment it was close at hand. It came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a halt and I stared, unable to credit my senses, for be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore my wondering eyes the monster separated into two</seg><seg type="columnLine">portions. The smaller body with its head broke away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the other! It sprang to the ground, and to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter amazement I discovered that it was a separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">being, a creature with two legs, in form precisely like</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself and the others, while the other portion was a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinct creature, a four-legged being unlike anything 1 had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. The two-legged being spoke in an unknown tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at his bidding the beings about fled to obey him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They seized his four-legged companion, who seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely docile for such a monster, and took him off;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they led the two-legged being to a cubicle, and they hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried to bring him food and drink. Here indeed, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange happening. He seemed scarcely different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others, he wore similar coverings upon his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">body and feet, and he appeared no more intelligent than</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who treated him like a superior being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, I wondered, was he so regarded ?

Judge of my utter bewilderment when, as T did</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, I discovered that the thing was no living creature but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The next instant it was in motion; we were rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the plain and though the motion was rough and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpleasant compared to that of our projectors, yet I en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyed its novelty. Undoubtedly, I was convinced, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whites were far superior to the browns, and I wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the monstrous creature on which the first while had</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared had also been a machine. But I learned it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, when, in our mad rush, I saw others of the same sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">with whites upon them. But also I saw others upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were browns, and once we met a machine like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which we were and in which, to my astonishment, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brown-skinned being. I was hopelessly confused. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as I could see the whites and browns seemed equal in</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"COON we reached the place of the whites. Here were</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of the cubicles, such as I had seen and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which lived browns. Between these we rushed on and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently came to more numerous and larger cubicles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of immense size, and with whites everywhere. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine stopped and I descended to the ground, as did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white being. I thanked him fittingly, and left him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon I regretted I had done so, for I found myself at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">total loss as to how to proceed. Everything seemed con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion. Everyone was rushing about, everywhere were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great machines, such as the one in which I had come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also I felt the need of nourishment, but I knew not</seg><seg type="columnLine">where to seek sustenance. During my life with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">browns I had learned to cat as they did, and presently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing a brown female seated beside such fond, I drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">near and asked for sustenance. She demanded that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should pay for it. At the time I knew not her meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was about to move on, when I noticed a brown being</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop beside the female and give into her hand some pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bright metal, whereupon she gave him food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a strange and interesting transaction. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">could she want with the metal ? Was it possible that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could transform it into more food, or was she of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange race that ate metal ? I forgot my hunger in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest and speculations. Another and another being</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, handed her metal, secured food and moved on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet the female appeared not to desire the metal but</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped it into a receptacle of artificial skin. It was most</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinating, and at last, as she appeared to. he friendly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I drew near, and using the tongue of the browns, I asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her what use she made of the metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "She gazed at me in astonishment and then replied that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she purchased food with it. But she had food, I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded her. Yet did she insist that the metal was used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to secure food, which she gave in exchange for more metal,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which she gave in return for more food. It was incom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehensible to me, yet I found that in this marvelous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">preposterous manner do all the Suarians live and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their whole lives are made up of thus acquiring bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal which they give unto others in exchange for food</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other things, which in turn are given to others for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Those who have nothing to give, give their lalior for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same bits of metal, yet the metal is of no use to them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It can be neither eaten nor drunk nor even transformed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the coverings for their skins. Yet ever, especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the whiles, arc all ceaselessly, throughout their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives striving, toiling, even fighting and killing one an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, to acquire the bits of metal, and even bits of paper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which pass ceaselessly from hand to hand. And yet I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not find that in the end there was any reason for it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those who had acquired vast amounts of the metal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper were no stronger, no healthier, no superior to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had little. To be sure, they dwelt in larger cubicles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they moved about in the machines I have described, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in machines of other sorts; they covered themselves with</seg><seg type="columnLine">more colorful and voluminous artificial skins, but they de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voured the same food--the flesh of murdered, four-</seg><seg type="columnLine">footed beings, the embryos of birds and the plant growths</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that were devoured by those who had the least of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal. And strangely enough, those who secured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the coveted stuff were not by any means the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced or intelligent. Often were they the lowest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most backward and most stupid of all the Suarians.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While others who were intelligent, who were advanced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were in fact scientists and should have been honored</seg><seg type="columnLine">and followed, had little or none of the metal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Of course I did not learn all this while watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown female with the food. Rather, my hunger again</seg><seg type="columnLine">claiming my attention, I asked her how it was possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to secure the metal with which to obtain the food I craved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she informed me. I must exchange something I pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed for metal or must labor for it. As I stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering what I might do to obtain food, the white be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the machine appeared, and seeing me standing be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the female, and perhaps realizing my plight, he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and handed me a piece of metal. Thanking him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gave it to the female who gasped, told me to eat my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill of her food and then returned to me more pieces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal--together with some of paper--than I had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. This was the most astonishing thing of all; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she should refuse me food until I gave her the metal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, when I had done so and had taken the food, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">should give back more metal than I had given her!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But such I found was the custom of these strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">denizens of Suari. To them certain pieces of metal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain bits of paper have greater value than others and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all things that are given for the metal or, as they call it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'money' also have their values. For some much money</seg><seg type="columnLine">is given, for others little. Even a being's labor has its</seg><seg type="columnLine">value and varies with different beings. And if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'money' of great value is given for something of little</seg><seg type="columnLine">value, then is money of little value given with the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that all may be equal. For a long time I could see no</seg><seg type="columnLine">object gained and no manner of purpose in all this, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time I learned that each time the thing for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">money was paid passed from one being to another, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater value was placed upon it, so that each time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">being who received the money gained somewhat over</seg><seg type="columnLine">what money he had given for it. Yet always in the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatsoever had been thus gained was again given out</seg><seg type="columnLine">302</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for some other object. Yet so strongly fixed was this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange custom, especially with the whites, that none may</seg><seg type="columnLine">live unless they follow it, and I myself was soon obliged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do the same. I had naught to give for money and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew nothing of Suarian labor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For a time I was at a loss, until by chance one day I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a being in an open space, with many beings of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors about him. He was causing objects to disappear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to reappear at his command and for so doing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being given the money. So, standing near and adjusting</seg><seg type="columnLine">my instrument. I so arranged it as to cause both the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects and the money before him to vanish and to be again</seg><seg type="columnLine">materialized beside myself. So that I had no lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">money henceforth, nor of lood, for with ease I could se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cure both by means of my device, which being beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">my coverings, attracted no notice, although great wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">was caused by the manner in which stores of food and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">money would vanish from sight. Yet I could not see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone was harmed by my so doing, for the money that</seg><seg type="columnLine">became mine would have been used but to be given for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the food and the food would have been given for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, and by removing both, nothing was lost. Also</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money was of need given forth for other things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as for a cubicle in which to dwell, for by observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and by questions I learned that it was a law of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whites that no being could sleep except in one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structures. That was a most strange thing; also quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">past understanding. I, or any being, might walk about</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the open air throughout the night. I might seat my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and remain as long as I saw lit, but I could not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose and sleep within the confines of the nest of struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures save within one of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE were many other laws and rules and</seg><seg type="columnLine">customs equally strange. Though these beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathed--there being an abundance of water in Suari--</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet save in the privacy of a tiny cubicle they could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">remove the artificial skins they called clothes in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathe. Yet neither could they bathe in the open air while</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus covered. The clothes must be removed and others</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed over their skins before entering the water. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">while there were large pools of water convenient to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand within the nests of buildings wherein the beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwelt, yet in these they could not bathe, but must go for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distance to certain waters allotted for the purpose. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the coverings that they donned for the purpose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathing were often beautiful, and revealed the most ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirable portions of the bodies, especially of the females,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet there were laws saying that these coverings could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve elsewhere, but must be discarded for others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Also, it was held barbaric and even punishable, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">male to appear not wholly covered with the artificial</seg><seg type="columnLine">skins they called clothing; the females, however, appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have a great deal more freedom in that regard. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were many other rules as foolish as it seemed, yet never</seg><seg type="columnLine">did I find a being of intelligence who could explain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for such things, for all of the beings of Suari are</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to yielding in all ways to strange manners</seg><seg type="columnLine">and conventions promulgated by others. Thus, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">all are much the same in form, they do ever strive to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vise such coverings that one should differ from another;</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet by the decree of some one, they must be all much the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same. Also it was decreed that whereas the females might</seg><seg type="columnLine">wear coverings of the most brilliant and beautiful hues,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the males must wear clothes of dull and sombre shades.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "In their cubicles, or as they call them 'houses,' they do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the same. Each being will strive to make his home dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinct from all others, yet in a way must all be alike. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all their boasted intelligence and culture--which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of our ancestors of the times before our history be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan--they persist in being uncomfortable and unhealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">by nesting together by thousands in these crowds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cubicles of every size. Often one will be erected upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">another. Often they will be so small there is barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">space to move about. Often they are as dark and dismal</seg><seg type="columnLine">as burrows in the earth, yet within them the beings live</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go to vast trouble and labor and give great sums in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their money to be permitted to exist in such holes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though there is no limit to the open air and sunshine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet do they hide themselves away in these vaults and use</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny artificial suns of no value with which to have light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And by some strange twist of their minds they will, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">great trouble and labor and expense, bring bits of earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plants and vegetation within their clusters of houses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although on every side the land may be filled with count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less things far more beautiful. Even wild birds that</seg><seg type="columnLine">abound in the open air are held prisoners within these</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwelling-places, and yet, at every occasion, the beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush forth, and afoot or in their machines; leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups of buildings they call 'cities' and in great throngs</seg><seg type="columnLine">fare into the outlying country for a day or a week or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and cry aloud and shout how wonderful it is, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet hurry back once more to their dens, whereas all might</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwell happily and free and much easier and better in</seg><seg type="columnLine">separate nests amid the verdure and sunshine, which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sonko-IIuara would give so much to have in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantities as they exist on Suari.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why these beings should thus suffer I could never</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn fully, but in a way it is due to fear, for fear is ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching at the hearts and minds of the Suarians. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past, enemies were feared, and for protection the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings herded together and built stout walls and dwell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings easy to protect. But now, though at times there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarrels and even wars among the beings of Suari, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusters of buildings are not needed, and in case of war</seg><seg type="columnLine">would he of no avail. Yet the fear of being alone still</seg><seg type="columnLine">abides in these beings, and tear of one kind or of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other dogs them always. He who has little, fears he may</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have more. He who has much, fears he may lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he has. He who is in good health fears illness, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he who is ill fears he may never be in good health. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">one is content; no one is satisfied and nearly all fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. Yet do they tempt death scores of times each day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They glory in taking risks of health, of loss of life, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why they should fear death is still a mystery to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They profess to believe as do we of Sonko-Huara that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spirit never dies but merely departs from the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another state. Some believe as do we that it finds a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in another body; others believe, that it goes to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other planet; and some believe that it goes to some special</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot where spirits rule, for in Suari there are endless</seg><seg type="columnLine">beliefs, faiths and religions instead of one universal re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligion as with us. Yet despite this l&gt;elief that death brings</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the spirit a better life and that there is nothing to fear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they look upon death with horror and will go to the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme measures to preserve life. Even the imbeciles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hopelessly injured and the crippled are preserved, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of being mercifully disposed of, as is our custom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And their doctors W'ill cut their bodies or their limbs into</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits and will leave them crippled or helpless for the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their lives, merely to save them from death. Tt is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">A VISIT TO SUARI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">303</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the fear of pain, for they endure a hundred times the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony of death in order to avoid death. Mainly, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, it is lack of faith in what they hold is their faith.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are never quite sure that their religion is the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, that their spirits will be better off, which proves how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much better it is to have but one faith for all, as do we of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sonko-Huara. And yet, in spite of their dread of death</seg><seg type="columnLine">for themselves, they regard the deaths of others quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">callously. They ruthlessly destroy thousands of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows in a war over some petty trifles or to satisfy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinations of some men who avariciously desire to add</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their power or their wealth. And they do not hesitate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put their fellows to death for the violation of certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws which they themselves make. Though they thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">constitute themselves the judges of their fellows, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim the right to take that, which they cannot give and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot restore, yet on the other hand, they will not per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit one of the number to take his own life, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">desires death for any reason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ND while they see fit to meddle in many, in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most affairs of their fellows, and to subject them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves to innumerable ridiculous rules and regulations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">no importance to themselves or to any one else, yet they</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid regulating and controlling the most important of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all things--the births of their offspring and their rearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Unlike our young that are incubated artificially and</seg><seg type="columnLine">under scientific rules, the offspring of the Suarians are</seg><seg type="columnLine">born alive, and each mother rears her own. Unfit parents</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not only allowed to mate and to produce young, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of limiting the reproduction of the race to scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tifically selected parents, neither of whom is aware of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's identity as with us, but they are permitted to rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own misbegotten to maturity. As a result, there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no steady weeding out of the mentally and physically un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit, nor a gradual improvement of the whole race. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, the puny, weak, imbecile, crippled and otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">imperfect offspring are not only permitted to live, but are</seg><seg type="columnLine">sedulously cared for, and every effort is made to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">them alive in spite of nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As a result of this, no two are alike mentally, physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally or in training, yet, when these strange beings edu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate their infinitely varying offspring, they are treated as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if all were identical, as if all, like our own, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientifically and artificially produced, incubated and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reared. There is no attempt to educate and train the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young according to their aptitude or their suitability for</seg><seg type="columnLine">ccrtain careers. There is no such thing as saying this</seg><seg type="columnLine">young being has peculiarities to warrant his becoming a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanic; this one should be an artist, and then regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating their education and training with that end in view.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, all are put through the same courses of studies, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ultimate career of each is left to the parents or to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">immature being's choice. Tn this, as in nearly all vital</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters concerning these inconceivably inferior Suarians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is 110 system, no certainty; everything is left to</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young Suarian, who decides to become a scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist, may become a good scientist and he may be a failure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is a question of chance instead of being predetermined</seg><seg type="columnLine">by searching analysis of his mentality, his physique, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">origin and every other factor. Yet in nearly every other</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect these beings are surrounded, buried, overwhelmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with laws. Numbers of beings are ceaselessly laboring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make laws and are being given great quantities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal discs called money to make these laws. So</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">many have been made in the past and so many are being</seg><seg type="columnLine">made each day, that not even those who make them can</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember them. For that reason they are preserved in</seg><seg type="columnLine">massive volumes. And if those who make the laws are</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorant of them, it is natural that the other l&gt;eings, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no knowledge of what laws have been made, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be quite unaware of them. As a result, everyone is con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly violating some law. But this does not appear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, for apparently most of the laws are made to no</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose. Yet there are certain laws that may not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken with impunity save by certain favored beings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of these seemed the most unreasonable and need-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less of all. No being may take that which belongs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, even though he be starving and the other has</seg><seg type="columnLine">more food than he can use; even though he. has nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other has much; even though he takes that which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must have in order to live from one who has taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than he needs from some other. If a being trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gresses this law he is set apart in a cubicle by himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and is given abundance of food and is cared for, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his punishment he is rewarded with that which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought to obtain. Yet he could not be thus housed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fed and provided for otherwise than by violating the law.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the being from whom the possessions have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken receives nothing in return, nor is he who is set apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to return that which he took. And neither may</seg><seg type="columnLine">the being who has been thus robbed of what was his, lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands upon him who took it, nor take from him aught in</seg><seg type="columnLine">return. So it would seem that the violator of the law is</seg><seg type="columnLine">rewarded and he who suffers is punished.

Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">hordes of ants they scurry about, rushing madly to save a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute of time, yet in the midst of this wild bustle they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will stop and gaze for hours upon some simple childish</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Their lives arc one ceaseless round of toil, for so</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive are they and so badly organized and so jealous</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one another that they must toil to live. But even when</seg><seg type="columnLine">by toil they have gathered more of the metal discs than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they can use in their lives, yet do they continue to toil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">working to live and living to work, but constantly crying</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for a rest, for a chance to live without thus toiling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet when they cease for a space to labor, they entertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves by toiling.

Many other strange ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">do they have of occupying themselves, yet one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangest is that they will flock in great herds unto certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">cubicles of large size, and will give up stores of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal discs to gaze at certain of their fellows, both males</seg><seg type="columnLine">and females, who standing upon a platform, do and say</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly the same things that these beings do each day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, when these beings cannot see their fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus repeating their actions and their words, they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">flock to other places wherein are pictures of beings doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same tilings.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us of Sonko-Huara seems more wonderful than</seg><seg type="columnLine">would our projectors or our vision-disseminators to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suarians, for we, having no great masses of water, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no need to cross such, know little of such matters, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all things pertaining to water, the beings of Suari</seg><seg type="columnLine">are in advance of us.

Thus the structures in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they dwell and which, clustered together, form</seg><seg type="columnLine">those spots that we of Sonko-Huara long ago recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">as made by intelligent heings, are often made of vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">size and beauty, towering unto the skies, whereas for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purposes of the beings' lives and labors no beauty is</seg><seg type="columnLine">required, and cubicles of no greater height than would</seg><seg type="columnLine">accommodate the beings would serve as well. For that</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, such small structures, separately placed, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve better, and with the sunshine and the air would</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly preserve the health of the dwellers within.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a cold and distant tinkle, and the tone of it said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, if the words did not, that he was late again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his appearance was not presentable for the distin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guished social captures that were expected. Thus it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">every evening; often the impatience at his tired appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance was hardly concealed. Some evenings he would ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear among them; at others he would not. It did not seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to matter; he wasn't noticed much, providing he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get in the way. The gayety always lasted till late; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would leive the guests and go to bed early, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had work to do in the morning. His wife would sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">till noon, and he would never see her until the next eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning dressed for another function. The occasional op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity for conversation between himself and her was</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied by her intense social ambitions and a pouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatience at the work which held him and kept her from</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing him off to her society audience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll come over to the University some day and break</seg><seg type="columnLine">up those machines," she complained.

To include</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in the text of this story, with which they have nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all to do, would bore the general reader; and,for that rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son I am omitting them from the story itself. However, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the benefit of the scientific reader, I append the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">abstract that I have made from Professor Grimm's notations</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the subject.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He received his original idea for this work from some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddington's writings on the state of matter within a hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">star (Stars and Atoms, A. S. Eddington, Yale University</seg><seg type="columnLine">Press, 1927). There, matter is very dense and exists only</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its simplest forms. There, atoms are not complete for</seg><seg type="columnLine">very long at a time, for the vast volumes of short electro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic vibrations (X-rays) are constantly displacing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrons in the outer orbits (see Bohr's articles in the Philo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sophic Magazine for July, September, and November, 1913).</seg><seg type="columnLine">But these displaced electrons are free only for a short time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and are quickly again absorbed by unsaturated atoms. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, they are again quickly displaced by X-rays, and so on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ad infinitum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It occurred to Professor Grimm that if X-rays could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">generated in the laboratory in sufficient density, and allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to exert their effect on matter which was less dense than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in the interior of a star, the free electrons would get far</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough away from the influence of unsaturated atoms so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they would remain free. Then, as successive electrons</seg><seg type="columnLine">were displaced from the atom, the character of the atom</seg><seg type="columnLine">would change, and the change would be recognizable in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory by physical and chemical methods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a matter of fact, this is actually what occurs in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coolidge tube (see page 122, Within the Atom, John Mills,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Van N'ostrand, 1923), and it amounts to nothing else than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the transmutation of one element into another. The ioniza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of matter by X-rays has been demonstrated with graphic</seg><seg type="columnLine">vividness by C. T. R. Wilson, who shows photographs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ionization-nuclei in water-vapor along the path of an X-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">(see page 102 of Mills' Within the Atom'). Professor Grimm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That made her happy. Money was needed for beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful clothes and for social climbing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Grimm had no wife. That was the way he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt about it. No companion to share his life's prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lems, ambitions, pleasures. He felt rather like an ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant quartered in a butterfly's house. That is why</seg><seg type="columnLine">movie love or the sight of real lovers made him melan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">choly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He clung to his work with the tenacity of the absent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded professor in stories. His researches in the ioni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zation of solid bodies, his concrete realization of perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">gases with high density--these had to be his wife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">love. They took the place of the romance that he missed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For, deep in his secret heart, concealed under that dry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">absent-minded exterior, he was intensely, boyishly ro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mantic. Fairy princesses and adventures in distant lands</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied his inmost thoughts. Outwardly he consoled</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself with work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "People that are too happy," he reflected, "never make</seg><seg type="columnLine">much real progress. Happiness has a tendency to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main satisfied where it is. Perhaps that is why I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten so much further than many of my colleagues who</seg><seg type="columnLine">are older than I. Perhaps if T were as happy as Puck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner--going away on another trip with his wife; they've</seg><seg type="columnLine">had half a dozen honeymoons already." Another far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">away look in his eyes, followed by a shrug of resignation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If I were like that, I should never have worked out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Integrator."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He contented himself with the thought that it is a fine,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was fascinated by the possibility of making definite physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chemical changes in matter by this method, and this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the modest beginning of his sensational achievement. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplied the first actual experimental verification of Bohr's</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory, first by demonstrating that as each quantum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy is lost by the electrons revolving in the outermost</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbits and as the orbits decrease in size, the nature of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom changes, and therefore, the nature of the matter which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it composes undergoes chemical transmutation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus, if a carbon atom with twelve revolving electrons</seg><seg type="columnLine">loses one quantum of energy (liberated as X-rays and reg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istered and measured with the crystal gratings and X-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectra of H. G. J. Moseley and deBroglie) and one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrons falls into the nucleus, it contains but eleven re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volving electrons, and becomes an atom of boron. This is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">process which in Nature requires ages of time; Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grimm hastened it experimentally. But his great triumph</seg><seg type="columnLine">was its reversal: the addition of a quantum of energy to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom, and the addition of a revolving electron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For one reason he had the advantage in this work over</seg><seg type="columnLine">any physicist in the world: he had at his disposal practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlimited power. The huge waterfall was surrounded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">State property and its use was restricted by donation to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">University. Lighting and power for the campus utilized but</seg><seg type="columnLine">an insignificant proportion of its energy; a million horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">power was available for experimental work. With this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his three banks of six-foot Coolidge tubes, Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grimm was able to generate X-rays which would compare</seg><seg type="columnLine">in volume and intensity for experimental work, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">X-rays in hot stars. With a tube modeler after that which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Millikan used in his photo-electric emission experiments, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in abstracting electrons from atoms, and in adding</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrons to atoms. The principle is simple: if an atom re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceives the increment of an electron, it radiates one quantum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of energy (X-rays) ; and vice versa, if a quantum of energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">is shot into the atomic system, the increase throws off one</seg><seg type="columnLine">electron. For making any element out of any other element,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it required merely a standardization of quantitative technic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straightforward though tedious matter to work out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DRIVING POWER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">309</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brave thing to be a scientist, and to sacrifice living for</seg><seg type="columnLine">scicntific work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Invention</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the morning he came into the laboratory, divested</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself of the outer world with a sigh at its empti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, and stood in front of the Integrator, ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge into the joy of another day's work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was this Integrator, which occupied the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor's days until he grudged time from it for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">classes; which occupied his thoughts at night, his lec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, his private conversation? What was this aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishing thing, before which its own creator stood in awe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely able to believe the work of his hands?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This morning he was testing it out again. A number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of times he had made tests to confirm the accuracy of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">"pattern" equations, but thus far he had always witnessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">its amazing performance alone. While the huge genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors were starting up and the glowing platinum targets</seg><seg type="columnLine">were warming, he sat at his desk and worked his slide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rule and jotted down figures. Then, with his eye on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop-watch that showed fifths of a second, he moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">switches and pressed keys. There, in the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, the air swirled in a spiral and became nebulous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cloud condensed, and there lay a sphere--or a brick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a bar; of gold or clay or ivory, or of fibre or jelly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This morning he was practicing on more complex</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. He spent more time with his pencil and slide-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rule, and got a growing flower, a wriggling worm, merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">by substituting different values for the terms of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">equation and setting his experimental quantities in ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord with the resulting "pattern." A bold effort resulted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a scampering little monkey, which darted chatteringly</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the big room, until Professor Grimm shut off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, whereupon the monkey melted away and disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared. He tried another combination, and there ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared a little machine, working busily away; and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shut off the power it melted, dimmed, and was gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a rush of air out of the windows and an electrifica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of everything in the room with the dissipated</seg><seg type="columnLine">charges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That sounds like some tale of sorcery out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Middle Ages! Or like the words of some writer who</seg><seg type="columnLine">has more imagination than scicntific training. Yet it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">physics, very accurate, very matter-of-fact, and withal</seg><seg type="columnLine">very dry for the non-scientific reader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the benefit of the latter, I am making a brief re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of the process, which is described technically in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the footnote. Professor Grimm had accomplished more</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the generation of large volumes of short-wave X-rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any man of his time. That was what became of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tremendous power of the huge waterfall, the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">that went into his laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Short-wave X-rays, as is well known, displace elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trons from the outer orbits of wandering electrons, say</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gases, leaving an unsaturated atom with an intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">avidity to combine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Autiior's Footnote: That is the fundamental principle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Integrator. But. there is still more to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Possibly the ease with winch gold or other valuable metals</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be thus made would have been the first thing to appeal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the average worker. But Professor Grimm passed that by</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hardly a thought, with his eye set on far more thrilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The idea of a unity of evolutionary processes is gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">being built up. The conception seems to be too big for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of our scientific men, but they will have to grow up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it now. The laborious presentations of such men as Horatio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hackett Newman and Henry Chandler Cowles to the effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">that evolution, instead of being something peculiarly limited</seg><seg type="columnLine">to organic life, is in reality one continuous and identically</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform process from the dissociated ions in a hot star to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gray matter of a college professor--this idea need no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer be offered with fear of ridicule.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grimm's work went on to verify it experimentally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grimm started with the bold idea that life adds nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">essentially different, when it steps into the evolutionary</seg><seg type="columnLine">jcale; not even qualitatively different. The appearance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life in the evolutionary scale, which matter undergoes, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not an abrupt break, not a radical change, any more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the appcarance of the carbon chain or the carbon ring de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes a radically different kind of chemistry from that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other elements. Life is but a property of molecules of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain complexity and certain arrangement; when this</seg><seg type="columnLine">complexity and arrangement appears in the evolutionary se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ries, life is present. The old idea that life or its germs must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have come from somewhere belongs in the museum with</seg><seg type="columnLine">phlogiston and the indivisible atom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, with his modification of the Millikan tube and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cataracts of short-wave electromagnetic vibrations, Grimm</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the molecules of enclosed air. added two electrons to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the carlion atom to make nitrogen; removed a common elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tron between two atoms and condensed them to molecules;</seg><seg type="columnLine">built up a protein molecule; removed common electrons by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hundred between molecules and built up complicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">compounds. The removal of the "common electron" was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the key idea, and is quite analogous to the removal of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">molecule of water from two molecules of ethyl alcohol with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the formation of ethyl-cther.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By pouring electromagnetic energy into the electronic or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits, he produced an infinite speeding up of material evolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. His product was protoplasm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when he had protoplasm, life was there along with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor did he stop there with his stimulation of evolution.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By continuing the supply of electromagnetic energy, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeded up the evolution of his organic mass--still the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">essentially qualitative process which had built up his inor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganic bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He carried it on up to complex living beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Possibly the greatest achievement of this genius, whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have found so pitifully human in everyday life, was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduce the quantitative technic of this process to mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took Planck's simple quantum relationship:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and built it up as functions of his spark-gap distance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">milliamperage, so that he could produce any kind of changes</seg><seg type="columnLine">he desired in the evolution of any kind of matter, backwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">or forwards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He named his equations "electron patterns": and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were complete, he devised further experiments to test</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. In the course of these experiments to check and</seg><seg type="columnLine">verify the "electron pattern" equations, the Integrator came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into being. It was the experimental apparatus which worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the huge room as its condensation-field, and which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to intensify the processes of inorganic-organic evolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">to such a degree that a cycle from dissociate electrons to</seg><seg type="columnLine">organic life could take place in a small number of seconds in</seg><seg type="columnLine">large masses of matter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">310</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With his broad streams of short waves, Grimm had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hitherto unparalleled opportunity to observe the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">havior of these unsaturaled atoms. His vast numbers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions condensed; his gases were turned into solids of dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fering composition. He worked with air in his early</seg><seg type="columnLine">exi&gt;eriincnts, and when lie got through lie had masses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">marble; marble probably, because the cosmic cloud con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sists chiefly of calcium.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus far the idea is simple enough, though technically</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult. It was the first step to the Integrator. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">block of marble was shapeless. Could he predetermine</seg><seg type="columnLine">what shape it was to assume? Could he determine on</seg><seg type="columnLine">something other than marble ? Could he make a complex</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of a dozen or more elements ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From that to the finished Integrator is a long story:</seg><seg type="columnLine">the relations of the components of a complex body and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their evolution from simple ions; the accurate control</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bombardment of free atoms by short-wave X-rays;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ability to pick off one electron from a nitrogen atom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two or three, and of selecting free atoms to attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the short waves--it is tedious and mathematical</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff. Curious indeed were the bodies he built up by</seg><seg type="columnLine">ionizing air, with its carbon-dioxide and vvater-vapor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rearranging and condensing ions; fantastic blobs of stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">that twisted and writhed and then changed on to some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else".</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Is it any wonder that the long and thrilling work</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed him intensely?

A sheltered dell, a picturesque</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottage, and through its windows, glimpses of a bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant, luxurious room, with draperies, lamps, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">divan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And last, and greatest of all, a beautiful woman!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She materialized in the doorway, with a melting smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a simple gown of soft silk; she waited for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he set the machinery to continue running, and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the picture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you real?" It sounded foolish, but he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">help asking it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Real, and waiting for you." She held out both hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They sat together 011 a divan. She was real. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands were soft, but there was a firmness in her hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake that he liked. He touched her shoulder and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. They were real. She smiled at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you believe I'm here now?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is your name ?" was his breathless reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Amaranth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's good. Sounds just like I feel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She brought him lemonade. He wished he were more</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully dressed, for she seemed interested in him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes were always on him. She was intelligent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked well. They talked a good deal in the preliminary</seg><seg type="columnLine">process of getting acquainted. She was cheerful, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a good sense of humor, and made him feel rested.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The evening passed, and he forgot; forgot problems</seg><seg type="columnLine">and troubles, and the gray world. When a man can</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget, he is happy. Professor Grimm had rarely been</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall see you again," they both said when he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">his leave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before shutting off the power, he checked his patterns</seg><seg type="columnLine">most carefully. He was satisfied with her and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything in the picture just as it was. Beforehand</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had not been sure just how it would come out. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was anxious that a repetition should be accurate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he shut off the generators gradually, one after</seg><seg type="columnLine">another. There was a dimming and a thinning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene of paradise before him. (He had a vague, fleet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing feeling, that was gone in a moment, that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing, annihilating somebody. But he reassured him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self that he could reproduce it all tomorrow.) It faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was gone. Only the hire room was left. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a momentary sense of pressure in the room as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disintegrating molecules expanded, and before the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows released the excess of atmospheric density. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was bare, just like the world. lie went home</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the late night, his nerves in a daze of fatigue</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his unusual experience; but it was a welcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatigue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day seemed endless to the Professor. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">blaze of bronze hair and the softest of round arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not go out of his mind. Even when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">busiest, he could hear in the background the low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">musical:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall see you again?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DRIVING POWER	311</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That evening he dressed carefully and came out as</seg><seg type="columnLine">spruce as one of his students. Back in the laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sat by his patterns and switches. The scene before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him rose again, the idyllic forest cottage, the lovely</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amaranth at the door. Everything was exactly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same. The patterns were accurate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time the eager pressure of her hand made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart leap. Her eyes rested admiringly on his natty</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure. Dry, scientific man, eh? If so, why should the</seg><seg type="columnLine">timid hand resting 011 his sleeve thrill him so intensely?</seg><seg type="columnLine">She brought him a grape drink this time, and cookies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a cushion 011 the divan. She sang a lilting song</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the piano.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor, after a hard day's work would take a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">functory turn at home, and then hurry to the paradise</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for him. There were, long hours of sweet com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panionship, wonderful communions of perfect under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standings in all fields of thought, lovely arms about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ncck, and a song in his heart like the music of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a changed man.

"You look</seg><seg type="columnLine">jollier than you used to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another invention," he evaded. "If I can sell it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some corporation like the Amalgamated Amusements,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there ought to be a million dollars in it for us.

Now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  â€¢Author's Foot Note: Before I got around to writing up the story of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Grimm, it happened quite naturally that I tola it to several</seg><seg type="columnLine">people; likewise I let several people read the manuscript before I sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted it for publication. All of these people agreed in demanding to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know something more about Amaranth. What kind of a person was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the? What diu the look like? How did she talk and act? What sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of character and disposition did she have?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They did not stop to think that this is a most difficult question to</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer. No one ever met or saw Amaranth except Professor Grinmi</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself; and he was not willing to talk about her personally. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed me the operation of the Integrator, "condensed" different things</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me, and even created a pair of prehistoric three-toed horsc9 thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">inchcs high. Hut I cannot blame him for not wanting to demonstrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amaranth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fortunately, the personality of Amaranth has nothing to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main trend of the story of Professor Grimm's search for happi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness; a knowledge of the personality is not essential to an understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of what eventually became of Professor Grimm and the Integrator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">We can. however, make some indirect deductions as to her person-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ality; and this deduced personality easts ax; interesting light on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations of the Integrator, and on the process of evolution in gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral. We know, for instance, that she was to the highest degree agree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able and attractive to him; otherwise he would never have spent as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much time with her as he did. Knowing him as well as I do, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy to make general estimates about what sort oi woman he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">find agreeable enough to give that much of his time to, and to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">him forget his work aud liis troubles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he sought company, and was a hail fellow well met,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of a ghost at the feast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weeks lengthened into months, and the Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you sold your invention to the Amalgamated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amusements yet?" his wife asked once or twice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. I'm still working on it.

I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting jealous of your old machine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt guilty. People thought he was working ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribly hard. He'd had some work in mind on solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, and it was getting time to be at it. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't seem to compel himself to get to work. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was happy and satisfied. He didn't want to work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of his faculty friends also talked him over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Grimm is losing his grip.

In this cleverly written and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceedingly plausible sequel, Mr. Gloukey tells more about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RECENTLY in this magazine I retold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story that Raymond Cannes told that Sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day night, October the seventh, 1928, to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ group of acquaintances at a certain Phila-</seg><seg type="columnLine">delphia club. T first told of the argument</seg><seg type="columnLine">between Sherman and Preston, who, discussing H. G.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wells' novel, "The Time Machine," had wandered oil into</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculation as to whether or not it would ever be possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to travel into the future or the past. Preston maintained</seg><seg type="columnLine">that such a thing was impossible and would always be</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible, while Sherman, disregarding the ridicule of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his opponent, expressed the opinion that "time-traveling"</seg><seg type="columnLine">might become a possibility at no distant epoch, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">science would be more advanced. The debate, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">impromptu, was interesting in the extreme. Each man</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought out several good points.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Raymond Cannes told that story which T have</seg><seg type="columnLine">retold in print and called "Paradox." He stated that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was true, but he did not ask us to believe it, as he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">present no confirmatory evidence. lie told how his col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lege chum, Endicott Hawkinson, a wealthy electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">wizard, had found in his mailbox a mysterious mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matical manuscript, which he found contained proof of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the existence of the "fourth dimension," and identified</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as time. Cannes told how Hawkinson constructed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical machine for projecting objects into the future,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and how Hawkinson was killed by a fire in his laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly after he had sent Cannes one thousand and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years into the future, to the year 2930.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Cannes told of his life in that far future year, of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystification at the circumstances surrounding the origin</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that manuscript, which was used before it was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could not have been made if it hadn't been previously</seg><seg type="columnLine">used. He told us of the grandfather argument, and also</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the time when he was actually and physically in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">different places at one and the same time. He told us not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only of those, but of other seeming paradoxes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">absurdities he had encountered. He told us that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not believe the things he saw happen, for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">twentieth century mind was incapable of comprehend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the complex mysteries of thirtieth century science,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which regarded the fourth dimension as simple and ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentary, and which dealt with traveling through time</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an accomplished and commonplace fact. He told us</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Dwar Bonn, the great thirtieth century scientist who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just invented a machine for traveling into the past,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as all time-traveling previous to 2930 had been into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future only. He told us of his love for a tall, slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl of the future, the daughter of the scientist. He told</seg><seg type="columnLine">us of the incredible adventure that took place on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster ninety thousand ton air-liner Patrician, en route</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Australia to New York. Fleeing from a discussion</seg><seg type="columnLine">incomprehensible to him of the mysteries of electrons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">protons and photons, he had come upon the girl and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulsively kissed her. She resented it and struck at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">accidentally striking and breaking one of the delicate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">life-disks attached to his shoulders. Everyone on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous airplane wore those disks. In case of an ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cident they served as parachutes, extracting power from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supply that was always being broadcast, and using</seg><seg type="columnLine">that power to break the tall. Cannes then told us how</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had gone in search of her father, the scientist, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found him dead, had captured his murderer in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that the murderer was using a stolen device to</seg><seg type="columnLine">render himself totally invisible, and how he (Cannes)</seg><seg type="columnLine">had discovered that the murderer was a spy from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet Mars, who later disclosed, unwillingly, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth was in great peril, as Martian spies had distributed</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over the earth, in its most densely populated parts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous quantities of the terrible Martian explosive</seg><seg type="columnLine">brarron, which possessed the power of being detonated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by certain etheric waves. One large quantity of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive was in the cargo-rooms of the great plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Patrician, and the radio wave, that was to detonate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive all over the world, was due to be broadcast in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen minutes, from the great station established by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the powers of Mars at the Earth's South Pole. All this</seg><seg type="columnLine">information was obtained from the Martian spy by arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial hypnotism. The spy concluded by stating that not</seg><seg type="columnLine">one terrestrial being would be alive after three days had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If you have read my account you will remember how</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cannes told us that the enormous plane, death-laden with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian brarron, was abandoned in mid-air, all of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers and crew descending to earth by using their</seg><seg type="columnLine">life-disks. But Cannes' disks had been destroyed. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped by using the time-machine just invented by Dwar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonn, which had returned him to the year 1928. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will remember that Cannes' last glimpse of the girl he</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved had shown her falling away from the plane, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was loaded with explosive, a very few minutes before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the explosion was to take place. But, because of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape through the fourth dimension, he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">known whether or not the explosion had ever taken place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never known whether or not the human race was an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nihilated in those three days in September 2930, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian spy had threatened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And you will rememlxir how Cannes had found out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from old records that his death had been recorded on</seg><seg type="columnLine">October 7. 1928, and how he had set the dials on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time-machine to indicate October the eighth, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">boasted to us that he had cheated fate. But fate had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheated him, for without his knowing it, the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not functioned quite accurately, and he had really</seg><seg type="columnLine">been returned to the seventh, the day on which his death</seg><seg type="columnLine">was due, (and also the day on which he told the story.)</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ten minutes after he had finished his story he was dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He never knew what it was that hit him.

He laid aside the magazine and remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimsically, "You've a peculiar imagination, Cloukey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just what good it is, I don't know, but it's peculiar. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">why did you kill off Cannes at the end? Isn't there</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough tragedy in real life without you story-</seg><seg type="columnLine">writers? ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I interrupted him annoyedly. I had no just reason to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be annoyed, but I was. I picked up my scrap-book and</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed him two slightly yellowed clippings from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philadelphia Evening Bulletin. One told of the fire in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory of Endicott Hawkinson, rich experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menter; and the other, dated a few months later, (Oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tober 8, 1928), told of the killing of Raymond Cannes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a street near City Hall, a few minutes before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous midnight, blaming the hit-and-run driver of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeding truck. Bill Simons read the clippings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to me inquiringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You used the names of real people?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I told a true story. That is, while I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether or not Cannes' story was true, it is true that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told that story to the group at a downtown club, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is true that he was killed later in precisely the manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated by the crumbling records he had been informed of,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the day stated, although he thought he had 'gypped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grim reaper' through the fourth dimension."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean yon believe. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do, although I occasionally have some doubts. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">if that story was a lie, it is the most amazing and unbe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lievable coincidence in the world that he should die in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a manner at such a time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then why did you publish it as fiction ? There were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to your own statement, a group of disinter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested and reliable witnesses who could vouch for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that Cannes told the story, and who also, you said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnessed the 'coincidence'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then my phone rang. To my astonishment, Cran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dell Sherman, the man who had started the argument</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Preston in the first place, was at the other end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wire. He was evidently pressed for time, hut he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vited me pleasantly to meet him at the club that evening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stated that he. wanted to gather together again all</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who had heard Cannes' story, as he had some</seg><seg type="columnLine">light to throw upon it. I went that evening for the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to that club, and I took Bill Simons with me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were the first to arrive. Shortly afterward came</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ralph Whiie and John Stevenson, as solemn and intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lectual a pair of young men as I ever hope to see. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked White to confirm my statement to Simons that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">story had been correct, exact, and true. W'hite did, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">reservations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The story was correct, in the main," he said pedan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically, "although Mr. Cloukey did embellish it a little;</seg><seg type="columnLine">not unduly, however. But he used a badly mixed meta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phor which really cannot be blamed on Cannes, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cannes didn't try to use any figurative language, in spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what the written version is. On the whole, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it followed Cannes' narrative rather closely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I'd have liked to have thrown a dictionary at White</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the time he finished his politely impolite pronounce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, but I had no dictionary anywhere near, and such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an action would have appeared unseemly in the dub. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">least I had confirmation of a sort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crandell Sherman and the others came in from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next room. After various greetings and introductions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sherman was ready to start his talk. I noticed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone who had been present at Cannes' telling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his story was present now, with the noticeable excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of 'Gene Preston, who had violently disagreed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sherman and who maintained that Cannes' story was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but fiction, and that traveling through time was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most absurd of all scientific absurdities. I ventured</seg><seg type="columnLine">a comment on his absence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "lie will not be here," said Sherman, and started at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once on the story which is the sequel to "Paradox."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Crandell Sherman's Story</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T HAVE always believed," he said, "that Cannes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was telling the exact truth to us that night.

In fact, he married my</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger sister. A day or so before we heard Cannes'</seg><seg type="columnLine">story I had been talking with her. She told me that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not disturbed anything in her husband's laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the fatal fire, as she thought that many of his scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific devices had not been seriously injured, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to have them appraised. She had been out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">town when the fire occurred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The day after Cannes' death I went over to Hawkin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's lab. His widow, my sister, let me in. On the burnt</seg><seg type="columnLine">remains of a heavy table were the charred remains of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale blue manuscript, that product of a far-distant cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tury. I identified it beyond the shadow of a doubt, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was only a heap of burnt paper. Some little pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't completely burnt. They were a pale blue.

He did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although he thought I was joking. That is, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thought I was joking if he himself hadn't seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">what happened to Cannes. By the time lie arrived I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined to my own satisfaction that Hawkinson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">time machine hadn't been seriously or permanently in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jured. The heavy hollow metallic cube, supported a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the floor by four large vitreous insulators, precisely</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was described to us by Cannes, had not been ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terially affected by the flames. The eight heavy cables</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading to its eight corners were still intact. The cube</seg><seg type="columnLine">was five feet six inches in each of its exterior dimensions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and five feet three on each edge of the interior. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a close fitting trap-door in the top of it, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remains of a wooden step-ladder were nearby. The heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabinet with the bakelite panel, from which emerged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight cables leading to the cube, was intact and hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">discolored by the. flames.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The fire in the laboratory had been not at all severe</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the place where the time-machine stood, though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage in other parts of the building had been very</seg><seg type="columnLine">great. This was an enormous piece of good luck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Preston arrived and was astounded and then con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced.

To be brief, we spent several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours in arguing with the electric company and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">got them to reconnect Hawkinson's private power line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">first sending electricians out to the lab. to repair the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faulty insulation that had caused the fire. After all</seg><seg type="columnLine">precautions against a repetition of the short-circuit with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the regular house-lighting circuit had been taken, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine of Hawkinson's for producing and employing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the NN-4 wave, the fourth-dimensional or time-wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we learned about from Cannes, was again ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We set the latitude and longitude dials to indicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the location of Sydney, Australia; and after much dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussion and argumentation we set the time dials to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicate September 28, 2930.

We were both a little crazy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excitement of what we had discovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We took a certain friend of mine who could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted to keep our secret into our confidence, and showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him what we proposed. He agreed to help us and to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knowledge of our disappearance to himself, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was dubious about the possibility of our intention</seg><seg type="columnLine">and about the advisability of helping us. We gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a signed statement absolutely absolving him from any</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsibility in case our disappearance should be traced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. When he had thus been protected, he aided us</seg><seg type="columnLine">by throwing certain switches on the panel of the cabinet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after Preston and I had climbed inside the hollow metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">cube. And so, although we were ignorant of the prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciples and the construction of the machine, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken out of the world in 1928 and put back in in 2930.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it seemed like ten seconds to us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sensation was one of rising with terrific accelera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion through perfectly black space.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian could not have been on the wing on the trip out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Sydney, for the speed, acceleration, centrifugal</seg><seg type="columnLine">force, etc., at twenty miles and more a minute would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed anyone, and the air-pressure, caused by the terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed would have blown him off the wing. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been on the Patrician, escaping the explosion even</seg><seg type="columnLine">later than Greta Bonn, landing on top of the wing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his set of disks after Jac had rescued her by his dare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil manipulation of the little plane. Perhaps he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same spy whom Cannes had captured aboard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Patrician. Cannes never knew what finally happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that Martian. Perhaps the spy had been able to es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape from the officers in whose custody he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed. Perhaps lie overpowered one of them and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">his set of disks. We do not know, but we can conjecture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At any rate he had overheard enough to inform him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the girl was Greta Bonn, daughter of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth-scientist.

And high in the sky above the South Pole was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light that ever came nearer. Gradually a low moan made</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself audible and ran up the scale, until it passed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond audibility, as an ear-splitting screech. With ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible momentum the second Martian space flyer plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the soft snow.

"You</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, I've conceived a sudden passion for physics and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemistry in the last year or so. 1 accidentally met one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my old professors and we got talking about science</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so forth.

With these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> words he attracted my attention to a closet at one end of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the room and opened the door. Within was the largest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> apparatus for television work that T had ever seen. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> immense scanning disk was equipped with lenses after</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the latest pattern, and the whole machine was connected</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> with a twelve-tube radio set.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Looks nice, doesn't it?" he grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    "It's really great," I replied, "and it must have cost a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> good deal. How large an image does it form?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Well, it cost me about $250.00, including the radio</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and tubes, but it is not quite finished yet.

I may</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> arrange to have it projected on a ground-glass screen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thus I whiled away the evening in Wadson's com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pany as he enthusiastically pointed out the different fea-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tures of his television set.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   But here T find myself digressing from the self-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> appointed task which I have set, the narration of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Message from Space, which has crcated -so much interest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and discussion in various scientific circles here and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> abroad. Therefore I will pass on to the first episode, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> advent of the meteor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It was towards the second week of my visit that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to bed rather earlier than usual one night, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned a fishing trip for the next morning. I was sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">330</seg><seg type="columnLine">As we approached closer, these areas proved to be the openings of great shafts, which apparently went far. Mow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 331</seg><seg type="columnLine">332</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">denly awakened by a deafening roar, immediately fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed by a terrific crash. At once I jumped up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced to my friend's room. As I switched on the light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was horrified to see Wadson lying unconscious on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor amidst the ruins of his bedroom. A hasty exami-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation revealed that his head had been hit by a falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture, but in a few minutes he regained consciousness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now that my anxiety was relieved, I inspected the dam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age more thoroughly. All the evidence pointed to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion. The bed and other furniture had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked over and great lumps of plaster had fallen from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls. Wadson was by now completely recovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shock and he came over to join me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks bad," he said. "Don't you think we had better</seg><seg type="columnLine">go around and examine the rest of the house?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you're all right, 1 guess we can. What, do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose, caused it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't imagine. I don't keep nitroglycerine or dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mite lying loose around here. Might have been an earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quake," said Wadson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An earthquake would have lasted longer and besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my room wasn't even touchcd. If it were an earthquake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire house would have been demolished." Just then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large piece of plaster fell from the ceiling, narrowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazing my arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We really ought to get out of here before the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing comes down," Wadson observed. "We will prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably find the cause when we investigate." As we stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside into the corridor, the full extent of the damage</seg><seg type="columnLine">became apparent. That section of the house near my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend's room had been almost completely destroyed. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">far we had been unable to assign any cause to the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's fortunate," said Wadson, "that the lab wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruined. As it is, there is still enough of the house left</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You seem to take it pretty calmly," I answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It can't be helped and we might as well make the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it." And with that we continued our inspection. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway at the cud of the hall was blocked with fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">debris which prevented our further progress in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction. Thereupon we turned to another opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems to me that I smell smoke," remarked Wad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, "and I believe it comes through here," indicating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">obstructed doorway. Even as T looked T could see faint,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazy whisps rising from the bottom of the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're right," I said. "The place must be on fire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had better get around there at once." Tn a few mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments we were out of the corridor and at the other side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the door. At first I could see nothing but choking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding torrents of smoke. However, the gray veil was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly borne away by an air current and we were able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get a clearer impression of the wreckage. The roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">above had been crashed in, leaving an irregular opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing the sky. Just below it was a similar hole in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor which now revealed itself as the source of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke. We descended to the ground floor. Here the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapors were almost overpowering, but by the aid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily improvised gas masks, made of wet towels, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in approaching the suffocating area. There,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the very center of the swirling wreaths of vapor, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were astonished to see an enormous piece of red-hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal smouldering in the ruins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A meteorite!" The thought had occurred to both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us simultaneously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We had a narrow escape that time," said Wadson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It might have crashed down on our heads just as well</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as here. There isn't much of a fire, fortunately, so we</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't have any trouble in that respect. And now I'd like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make an analysis of the meteor." With the aid of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few buckets of water, we were able to quench the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparks and flames around the great rerolite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time the metallic mass had cooled to such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree that we were able to make an examination. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">great care we detached from it the clinging bits of plaster</seg><seg type="columnLine">and charred wood which it had gathered on its downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight through the roof and carricd it into Wadson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory, where we deposited it on a bench.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even a superficial analysis of the substance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to show that, as in the case of almost all other</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteors, it was metallic iron of a fair degree of purity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My friend, however, was still unsatisfied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd like," he said, "to make a spectroscopic examina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. That would be the quickest way of determining</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether there are any other elements mixed with it such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as carbon and silicon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly he made preparations for his analysis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His method was very simple. He removed a small por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the metal and held it in the flame of a hydrogen</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast-lamp until it was red hot. Then he examined it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a direct-vision spectroscope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing unusual that I can see," said Wadson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There are faint traces of sodium. Of course there must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been more of that element originally, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mostly burned up in passing through the atmosphere. Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait, I think I see something. It looks like a slight dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coloration near the sodium line. It's probably a flaw in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instrument, though. However, it may lie something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll try another spectroscope." Wadson rose and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a near-by cabinet where he kept his more delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of apparatus. He took another spectroscope and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it peered intently at the glowing metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Same discoloration," he said. "I think I'll take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimen from nearer the center of the meteor." We</seg><seg type="columnLine">drilled a large hole to the interior and succeeded, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">much labor, in extracting some borings from the bottom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This, too, he submitted to a spectroscopic analysis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While lie looked through the eye-piece of the instrument</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face changed. First a puzzled look, then a gleam of</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bill," he said, "I'm pretty sure I've discovered a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">element. Just come here a minute." He handed me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectroscope and bade me examine the glowing bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal. Without a doubt he was right. Close to the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row sodium line was an unfamiliar band of orange.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Wadson, "what do you think of it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, it looks as though you've discovered a new cle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. We'll have to call it 'wadsonium' in your honor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think it is quite probable that this meteor does not come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Solar System at all, for of all the elements</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in solor meteors so far, not one had been previ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously unknown on the earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That increases the value of the discovery," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wadson. "Now I'd like to separate some of this new</seg><seg type="columnLine">element from the others and determine its properties,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iwtli physical and chemical."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BY this time it was almost four in the morning and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were very tired as a result of all the preceding</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement, but it was only with .the greatest difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I persuaded Wadson to leave his meteor for a while</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get some sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we got up the next morning I wired to the near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est city for a squad of workmen to repair the damaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MESSAGE FROM SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">333</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">house, for I knew that my friend, immersed in his scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific work, would never think of attending to such trivial</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile I spent most of my time watching Wad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's proceedings in the laboratory. With the skill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience of the true scientist he was gradually arriving</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a number of important, conclusions regarding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown element in the meteor. He had already ascer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained its atomic weight and was not a little surprised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find that it approximated the comparatively large number</seg><seg type="columnLine">327.81. It was about three days later that he announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the atomic number was 106. He was radiant</seg><seg type="columnLine">with joy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You sec," he explained, "this indicates not only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown element but a whole series of them which must</seg><seg type="columnLine">exist between uranium, which has an atomic, number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">92, and wadsonium, whose number is 106. Fourteen, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact. However, due to their high atomic weights, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are probably very unstable and that would account for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their absence from the earth at the present date. It may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be that wadsonium bears the same relation to uranium</seg><seg type="columnLine">that uranium does to radium. Of course then it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">very likely have a large half-period and there might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">traces of it somewhere on this planet that haven't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">found yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you account," I asked, "for the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost all of the wadsonium came from the interior of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meteor? If you remember, specimens from the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face only contained minute traces."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," said Wadson, "is a matter to which I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">given considerable thought. My theory is this. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor must have originally consisted of wadsonium</seg><seg type="columnLine">only, but during the course of its wanderings through</seg><seg type="columnLine">space it encountered vast numbers of very tiny meteor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ites, cosmic dust as it were. These gradually gravitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards it on account of its superior mass which, pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious to its passage through our atmosphere, must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been enormous. Now you may picture this big chunk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wadsonium embedded in a tremendous shell of infinitesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal particles, largely consisting of iron. Then, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">traversed the earth's atmosphere, the mass began to glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally to fuse. The wadsonium at the center began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spread itself through the entire mass by diffusion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But before this process had an opportunity to get more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a start, it hit the surface of our planet and slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooled, with most of the wadsonium still in its original</seg><seg type="columnLine">place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's splendidly worked out, but . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," interrupted Wadson, "it's only a hypothesis</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there arc a great many 'buts' in it. Anyway, it really</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't matter very much. The important thing is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wadsonium which I think I have succeeded in separating</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost completely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a smile he held up for my inspection a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass-stoppered bottle which was about two-thirds full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a silvery metal looking just like magnesium. But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">the resemblance ceased. Magnesium is remarkable for</seg><seg type="columnLine">its lightness, while the half-pint or so of wadsonium</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have weighed almost twelve pounds. In my sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise I nearly dropped the bottle. Wadson smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Heavy? That's the effcct of the high atomic weight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How does it behave chemically? Would you call it</seg><seg type="columnLine">an active element?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rather active. It decomposes steam at high tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures and displaces hydrogen from cold dilute hydro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chloric acid. In the air, as you can see, it forms a thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">film of the oxide which prevents further corrosion. Tt's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">very much like aluminum in that respect, aÂ»d it is slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">radioactive. I should say its rate of decomposition is</seg><seg type="columnLine">about one-tenth that of uranium, which would give it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-period of 50,000,000,000 years, making it many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times as old as this planet. No doubt, as I said before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are considerable quantities now existing, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are most likely to be found below the surface."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the man in charge of the repair work came in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask about one or two particulars regarding the recon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction and our conversation was broken up. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to drive into town later for some supplies that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed, I heard no more about the wadsonium that night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but my friend continued working in his laboratory even</seg><seg type="columnLine">long after I had gone to bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning he was jubilant, although pale from</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have discovered," he informed me, "that wadsonium</seg><seg type="columnLine">possesses a new and astounding quality which I had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">previously suspected. I suppose you know that the elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trical resistance of selenium varies as the intensity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light falling on its surface increases or diminishes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This property has been put to various uses in a limited</seg><seg type="columnLine">way such as turning on lights automatically when night</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls and so on. Now the electrical resistance of wadson-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ium is also variable, and quite by accident I found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it depends, like selenium, on the influence of electro-mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">netic waves; but these waves, instead of being of such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme shortness as those of light, are between one and</seg><seg type="columnLine">four meters long. Don't you see the significance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder if it mightn't be applied to radio in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. I understand they have been doing quite a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimenting in short wave transmission recently." i</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked inquiringly at Wadson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's just the idea. You see, I plan to have a wad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonium cell in series with the incoming tuned signal. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability of the cell to conduct electricity will vary with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of the radio wave. The rest is obvious."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But that is practically what happens in a regular radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube. A very slight change in the minus potential of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grid produces a great alteration in the plate voltage. While</seg><seg type="columnLine">the principle is different, the general effect is the same.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 fail to see how your cell is going to revolutionize the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio industry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are forgetting," said Watson, "the superior sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitivity of my device. The vacuum tube is really a crude</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair. The necessity of using a heated filament to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vide the electron stream imposes a good deal of compli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation. Some radioactive substance such as radium might</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the place of the filament as the beta emanations are</seg><seg type="columnLine">really a flow of electrons. They could be separated from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other rays by magnets. However, an arrangement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this kind would certainly increase the cost and for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason would not be very practicable. But I think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will find that the wadsonium cell will be much superior to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ordinary tube." Then he went to his laboratory where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had spent nearly all his time since the fall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was on the following day that the first wadsonium</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell made its appearance. After a solitary morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk I visited my friend in the laboratory to sec what</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress he had made. He was bending over something</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a bench which absorbed all his attention. I called but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not seem to hear me. Then I noticed that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing a pair of headphones. As I went over to him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">334</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">removed them while he made some adjustments on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," I said, "what's new?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wadson held up the object on which he had been work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here," he said, "is a wadsoniuin cell." It was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of a glass tube about six inches long and two inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">in diameter. The top had been drawn out to a point and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sealed off while the bottom was tapered so that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">just fit the UX radio tube base to which it was attached.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Supported in the inside was a thin sheet of a metal which</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 took to be wadsonium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ts there a vacuum inside?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, just nitrogen. That is l&gt;ecaiise T found out that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the film of the oxide which forms in the air has in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">way a harmful effect on its sensitivity. It was easier to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill it with nitrogen at atmospheric pressure than to go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trouble of exhausting the air from within. As you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see. there are four terminals. Two of these are con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected to the incoming signal while the other two are</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected in series with a "B" battery and some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cone or loud-speaker. It happens that in addition to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve tube set. there is a smaller one which I brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">along just for short-wave work. With a few changes</seg><seg type="columnLine">I believe it will suit our purpose exactly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In less than half an hour Wadson had made the neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary arrangements and we were ready to test his new</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube. The set was specially designed to operate at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">range of one, two, and five and a half meters which in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded those lengths influencing the wadsonium cell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not without a certain excitement that I gazed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cone speaker which had been connected to the set. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend turned the dial beginning at four meters, and grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually going down. At first there was nothing but a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">humming sound. I asked W'adson what caused it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began to say something about induced currents in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell when the monotonous drone was suddenly broken by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sharp, irregular crackling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Static," said Wadson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to a lower wavelength. Nothing. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">he twisted the dial. Still nothing. By this time he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to two and a quarter meters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," was his comment, "there are very few</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitting sets working on such very short wave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengths. Possibly one or two radio enthusiasts are try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it for the sake of the novelty. Of course, if wadson-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ium is ever found in sufficiently large quantities, and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">wadsonium cells become popular, then all of the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadcasting systems will be forced to change to shorter</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavelengths. In previous experiments I found that it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to differentiate, between two signals artificially</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced in the laboratory when their wavelengths are</seg><seg type="columnLine">very close together, thanks to the wadsonium cell. There-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, there will be little fear of interference, such as might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be expected, if all transmitting sets were to be limited to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">range of three and a half meters. I have succeeded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely separating two signals when the difference be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween their wavelengths was less than one-seven-hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dredth of a meter and I have 110 doubt that by the aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of new improvements I may do better yet. Well, I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think there is much use in going down any more until we</seg><seg type="columnLine">build a transmitting set which will work at such low</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave lengths."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the way," I said, "while we are on the subject of</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio, I have l&gt;een hearing so much about the chance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiving a message from Mars which is supposed, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some people, to be inhabited by intelligent beings. Do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you think there is the least likelihood of this occurring?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wadson smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'T see you have been reading the Sunday supplements</seg><seg type="columnLine">in die newspapers. As a matter of fact, recent evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not seem to confirm the earlier views as to the pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility of the planets being inhabited by intelligent, reas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oning beings. What is more, any radio signals they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">send us would most probably be unable to penetrate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heavyside layer unless they were of an exceedingly short</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave length."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your last objection would be admirably answered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the special qualities of the wadsonium cell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right," said Wadson, "all we need now is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio operator on Mars. Well, it's getting late now. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps we had better go to bed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I fell asleep almost immediately and it seemed only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes later that I was awakened by Wadson. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">I turned sleepily around I could see that he carried a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashlight in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bill," he whispered, "I think I heard voices in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lab. There must be burglars there and I hate to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my precious wadsonium cell being ruined by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">careless crook. Here, take this." And he slipped an auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic into my hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Together we stole silently down to his laboratory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unmistakably there were sounds of voices or rather of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. It was an unusually high-pitched tone for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proverbially stealthy thief. The language was unfamiliar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We tiptoed into the laboratory through a side door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was dark. I drew the pistol and Wadson held his torch</seg><seg type="columnLine">in readiness. Suddenly he snapped on the light and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant beam darted around the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hands up!" 1 shouted. Nothing happened and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice continued to prattle away. Wadson switched on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room light, but we saw no one. It was only then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I realized the source of the sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The radio!" We stared at each other for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began to laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Bill," said Wadson. "that's one on me. T must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have left the switch on by mistake. But 1 would like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know where that voice comes from. I certainly never</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard that language before. It might be wise to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">an impression of it. I have some of those repeat-a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice phonograph records with which you can do your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own recording. In that way we can get an accurate copy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rest of the speech." In a surprisingly short time</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had the phonograph with the blank records taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the talk. About an hour and a half later the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next day we drove into town with the records</seg><seg type="columnLine">and submitted them to the inspection of a friend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wadson's who studied languages as a hobby. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">mastered no fewer than forty-three different tongues and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dialects so we had no doubt that he could enlighten us as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the philological classification of our strange specimen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he was as baffled as we were. However, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much interested when we told him the whole story</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he promised to come to the laboratory that night to</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen to our mystifying speaker should lie talk again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before returning. Wadson bought a liberal supply of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank disks to enable us to record whatever might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wadson's friend came up at eight o'clock and was led</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once to the laboratory. The voice started very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier than on the preceding night. At a quarter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine a low musical note issued from the cone as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MESSAGE FROM SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">335</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a piano key had been gently struck. After an interval</seg><seg type="columnLine">of live minutes the mysterious voice spoke again. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone was rich and clear and the speaker uttered his words</seg><seg type="columnLine">evenly without any trace of emotion. We had the pho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nograph taking down an entire impression of- the mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage. The philologist listened with the deepest attention.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After an hour he suddenly turned to us and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''It seems to me that T have heard this before. Yes, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am sure now. The person delivering it evidently consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers it of importance, repeating the same speed 1 every</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. This thing has me puzzled, I'm afraid, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot reconcile these words with any language T have</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever heard. If you don't mind, I would like to have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete impression. There is a certain Professor Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Rice of Oxford, who is spending his summer near</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. As his field is the Science of Languages, 1 am sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">he will be able to give us a clue to the identity of Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">X, if I may so call our unknown lecturer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wadson readily assented. Accordingly the records</seg><seg type="columnLine">were placed in the hands of Professor Rice who prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised to give us his expert opinion within a few days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A week later, when my friend and I were absorbed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intricacies of a chess game, we received a visit from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the philologist accompanied by Professor Rice. Both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them seemed to be keyed up to a high pitch of excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wadson," said the former, "the thing's stupendous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After puzzling over the records for almost a week, Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Rice was unable to find any corresponding known</seg><seg type="columnLine">language. In short, he was forccd to conclude that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds originated in another planet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wadson nearly jumped from his chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right. I was surprised, too. but there's no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of explaining it unless we are going to suppose that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have been the victims of an elaborate practical joke</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seems hardly likely. You're going to be famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, old man. whether you like it or not. The Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">will tell you how he was led to this conviction."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It really wasn't very difficult. The use of the radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly indicated that the sender must belong to a highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">progressive race. This at once removed the necessity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">considering the hundreds of dialects in use by the various</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage tribes and thus considerably narrowed my search.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was unable to find any tongue, even remotely corres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponding. Of course you may argue that this language</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be a secret one, in use by some society or other. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">then why should such a group go to the trouble of learn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a whole new language, when a simple code would</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffice for transmitting radio messages not intended for</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside ears. Then, knowing the gigantic power of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio set, I thought it very likely that the sender was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitant of another planet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My mind was in a whirl. So my chance remark to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wadson a few evenings back had some foundation after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think it would be very interesting to try to decipher</seg><seg type="columnLine">this message. You know, it may be of importance. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think so, Professor?" Then I suddenly realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the philologist had just been speaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, beyond a doubt. It ought not to be so very hard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have material enough to work with. It will be an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyable way of spending the vacation. Come to my house</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow morning, and we can make arrangements. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wadson, until we translate this speech I would not ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vise you to encourage anyone else to listen to our planet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ary communicator."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A little professional jealousy," I thought. "He is</seg><seg type="columnLine">atraid someone else may succeed in deciphering it before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he does."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it was late our guests departed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wadson," I said as soon as we were alone, "I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspected that one wadsonium cell was so powerful. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time when you first tried to use it, you only ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected to receive terrestrial signals, and yet the message</seg><seg type="columnLine">we heard must have come from a point many million</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles away at least. The wadsonium must be thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of times more sensitive than we ever supposed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I thought of that, too," said Wadson. "The metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be under some external influence. We might go over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and investigate." We did, but at a first glance there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing out of ordinary that we could see. Then at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion Wadson closed the switch and, as we had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed the dial setting, the unknown voice instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">projected itself into the room. My sleeve accidentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked over the cone speaker. The flow of words sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that ? I must have pulled out the connecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Wadson, "you didn't. Something else went</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong." With those words he picked up the cone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced it in its original position near the radio. To our</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense surprise the strange voice suddenly resumed its</seg><seg type="columnLine">tireless monotone. Wadson laughed a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see it now. It is the action of the magnet in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaker on the wadsonium, I'm pretty sure." He picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a big horse shoe magnet and held it near the wadson-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ium cell. The increase of sound was marked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I never suspected anything like that before," he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. "This wadsonium is full of tricks. At any rate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it opens a new field for investigation." As if to prove his</seg><seg type="columnLine">last words, Wadson took otf his coat and at once pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded to test this new physical property of the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">with what materials he had. The net result of all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimentation was that the extent to which the wad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonium was affected was inversely proportionate to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">square of the distance between it and the magnet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EIGHT days later we were the recipients of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit from the philologist and Professor Rice. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">many long hours of intensive work they had succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in almost completely translating the message.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I try to describe the excitement at this point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">words fail me. The whole thing was tremendous. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">subsequent shock produced when this veritable bombshell</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thrown into the civilized world is well within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory of most of us. Wadson's laboratory at once be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a Mecca. Had he wished, he could have sold his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wadsonium at the time for over $15,000 per milligram,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he generously gave all but a small specimen to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bureau of Standards where its various properties aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished the staff. At the present time, however, it has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascertained that considerable amounts of this metal are to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be found in the earth, in some places, at a distance of less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than four miles below the surface. Plans for its recov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery are now under way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of this was secondary to the worldwide interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was created when the translated message was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">public. The planet from which it was sent, far from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Mars as 1 had at first suspected, was proven to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">satellite of one of the remoter stars of the Milky Way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose distance from the earth is only to be expressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in thousands of light years. This last fact is significant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it means that all of the events described took place</seg><seg type="columnLine">336</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZIJNG STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">many ccnturies ago and the voice we heard speaking be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to a person, dead since the time of the Pharaohs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the faintness that a radio signal must possess after</seg><seg type="columnLine">traversing that great void of space is considered, we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">only wonder the more at the extreme sensitivity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wadsonium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The translation of the Message from Space which fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows is undoubtedly of great importance. It suggests</seg><seg type="columnLine">new and terrible methods of warfare whose almost un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">limited destructive potentialities would be an answer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able argument for World Peace. It brings to mind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility of finding on other planets than our own ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced forms of life, with which we may some day hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">to communicate. But it has always seemed to me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most important angle from which to view our inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellar message is that from which the sender considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">it when he transmitted it, namely as a warning. His con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant repetition of the whole speech would alone be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient mark of the extreme gravity of the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  However, I will not venture any more private opinions</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the subject, but I will leave the reader to form his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own ideas after his perusal of the Message from Space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           TRANSLATOR'S NOTE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While reading the following it should he kept in mind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that many of the words have been found to have no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> earthly parallel and in these cases the translator has been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> forced to rely on his imagination.

Countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago we had tapped the wells of molecular energy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This proved insufficient to satisfy our demands. Atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy was released long afterwards by whose aid we</seg><seg type="columnLine">performed mighty engineering feats which would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed impossible before. The whole surface of Astrax</seg><seg type="columnLine">was practically made into one huge city whose spires</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose hundreds of feet into the sky. Giant air liners</seg><seg type="columnLine">plowed the upper layers of the atmosphere, loaded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight and passengers. With our atomic energy we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were able to build great space-fliers with which we colo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nized several neighboring planets. Down below, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowest levels of the city, dwelt the scientists upon whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor rested the mighty structure of our civilization. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">government was simple. A Planet Ruler was selected at</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular intervals of five years by a council of one hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred who also acted as an advisory committee. Its decision</seg><seg type="columnLine">was final.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the time of the invasion I was a sub-inspector of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing stages for the interplanetary vehicles. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">position kept me constantly upon the upper level of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. My work was most important although easy. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">day I personally examined each of the stages in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">division. This meant that I had to make sure that the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire surface was free from any obstruction, which might</seg><seg type="columnLine">injure a flier on impact, and that the crew whose duly</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was to take charge of the ships on their arrival was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert and ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mechanism of these space vehicles was not at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">complicated. A method had been perfected for increas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the power of magnetic attraction to an unprecedented</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree. The power of repulsion between like poles had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been similarly developed. Beneath the lowest levels of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Astrax a great magnet of gigantic power had been placed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since our scientists had found a way of concentrating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magnetic forces of attraction and repulsion to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of a ray, it was a simple matter to equip space ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such rays. One of these corresponded to one pole</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the magnet and the other to the other pole. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier was navigated, the magnet formed the base of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge triangle of which the flier was the vortex. The ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be moved in any direction whatever by suitable ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justment of the rays. It may interest any scientist who</seg><seg type="columnLine">is hearing this account that the experiments first made</seg><seg type="columnLine">were based on the principle which states that whenever a</seg><seg type="columnLine">force is applied in one direction, there results an equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">force exerted in the opposite direction * The force used</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an explosion. Small parcels of explosive compounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were placed at various points about the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicle. The detonation of any of these would cause the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier to move in the direction opposite to that in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the explosion was applied. Unfortunately, the resulting</seg><seg type="columnLine">gases, due to the intense cold of interstellar space, first</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquefied and then froze solid, clogging up the explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber. This necessitated a system of artificial heating</seg><seg type="columnLine">which proved unsatisfactory. Hence the adoption of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">later method.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fliers were in the form of long cylinders with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemispherical ends. One ray machine was placed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">each extremity but both were controlled from a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin at the front. There is little to be said about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">further details of their construction, except that they in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded every convenience for the 1 tent fit of the occupants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On their arrival from a voyage they would maneuver so</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to gain a position directly above their respective land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing stages. Then, slowly shutting off the repulsion rays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would sink to the surface permitting those within to</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerge. As the outer envelope was a vacuum between</seg><seg type="columnLine">two layers of a special material, it can readily be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">why it was so important that the landing stages be kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">free from any obstruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a magnificent sight, especially in darkness, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see those giant fliers dart in from distant planets many</seg><seg type="columnLine">sortors away, then suddenly swoop down to the landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stages and finally settle down to rest, while their lights,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Translator's Note.

His name was Plutor Omnex A05X, which latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">symbol denoted his rank. He was much perturbed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">something, although I did not dare to ask him what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong. On his desk was a chart which automatically</seg><seg type="columnLine">recorded the positions of each of the space fliers in service</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the moment.

With this</seg><seg type="columnLine">enigmatic remark he abruptly stopped the conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bent again over the object on his desk.

For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time he did nothing but gaze intently at his chart, check-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the various positions of the space fliers by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a table which he kept constantly on hand.

In practice it was not constructed until the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beyond the atmosphere of Astrax where the cold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space kept it below the freezing point of hydrogen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Plutor Omnex then turned his attention to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Prixton Lestex, I am about to entrust you with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave mission.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked over to his desk and looked at the chart which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been examining. The principle was simple. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier was represented by a tiny dot of light which moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a rate proportionate to that of the machine it indicated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The chart was divided by a system of crossing lines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">These corresponded to imaginary lines in space by which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the position of any ship could readily be determined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This," said Plutor Omnex while pointing to one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bright specks, is passenger ship #A38B36 which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound for our most distant planetary possession.

This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time that the chart did not exactly correspond</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the table.

I have, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will remember, ordered an inspection flier widi a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wexton ray projector.

Clenton Stretor R91B7 was in charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I slid the door shut and in a moment the ship was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its way. Since it was equipped with an automatic chart</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as the one I have already described, it was a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter to follow accurately the movements of the ship we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pursuing. Constant reference to a table convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that space ship #A38B36 was following an erratic</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. Day alter day we sped on. always reducing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance between the two dots of light on the chart which</seg><seg type="columnLine">represented the flier we were to overtake and our own.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joll Randor was a most excellent pilot. It so happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">that just at this time a giant swarm of meteors had</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the orbit of Astrax so we were constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">menaced by a collision with one of these bodies, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randor's skill always evaded the danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OK the third day I was awakened from a sound sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Clenton Stretor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sorry to have disturbed you, sir, but I am afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there is a fleet of Droll fliers about 21,000 lentors</seg><seg type="columnLine">(miles?) ahead. I don't think we can escape them for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are surrounding us on all sides." This news an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noyed me very much. Personally I would not have1</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded a fight with the savage Drulls, but the success</seg><seg type="columnLine">oi the expedition was of supreme importance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell Joll Randor to put on full speed and try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break through their lines.

Stretor saluted and was gone. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meantime I reviewed the situation. Here we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by the Drulls who would hardly let us oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a battle. But I had orders from the Superin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendent Inspector which admitted of no delay, so it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be impossible to turn back. We must go on. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped with a ray machine, it was true, but on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other hand, the Drulls had perfected an instrument, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">projected a beam capable of raising the temperature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our flier to the boiling point almost instantly by exciting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the molecular motion of its component substances. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, in spile of this we must go through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time I could clearly see the enemy fliers in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance with the aid of a telescope. Now the Drulls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were only 8,000 lentors away and we were approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">them every instant. At this stage of my reflections,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came a knock at the door and Stretor entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir, it will be impossible to pass them. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to avoid a fight is to retreat." At this last word I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook my head decisively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Stretor, I'm not turning back. It will be up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to clear a path through the enemy for us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll do my best, sir, but if one of their heat rays gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">us we are done for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right. You had better go and tell the others to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for action." I looked again in the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drulls through one of the windows and estimated their</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance at about 350 lentors. Already I could see them</seg><seg type="columnLine">darting their terrible heat rays, but since they were only</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficient at short distances we had nothing to fear from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went down to the control room where the Wexton</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray machine was situated. Stretor was bending over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus making some final adjustments. The pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">was standing next to the instrument board by which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements of the flier were controlled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Randor," I said, "I think it might be wise to adopt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a zigzag course. It might help us to escape their heat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> rays, although it will make it harder for Stretor to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">his machine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's all right, sir," said Stretor. "I'll manage with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out any difficulty. Our escape is of more importance</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a possible victory." Accordingly Randor made cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain motions and I felt the flier sway to and fro as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted about in various positions. While it did enable us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to elude their heat rays, nevertheless they kept us con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly under the glare of the powerful searchlights with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which their space ships were equipped. Since our exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">position was always known, they could begin to close in</seg><seg type="columnLine">on us and I saw that a time would come when we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer be able to dodge their rays. I signaled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stretor to begin projecting the Wexton ray before our</seg><seg type="columnLine">foes got too close. It was well that I did so, for already</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flashes of their offensive weapons were coming un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably near. After a few moments we had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction of seeing one of the enemy fleet suddenly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gin to glow violently and then completely crumple up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This opened a gap in the surrounding line through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randor attempted to lead our flier. Unfortunately he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment too late for another Drull ship rushed in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the place of the one destroyed at the exact time we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were passing through the opening. There was a terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash in which we were all thrown to the floor. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">we rose, the ship with which we had collided was gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were through the gap and safe. No, not entirely safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Stretor had found that the hydrogen attachment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray projector had been broken off and at the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">repairs were impossible since therei was no more of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance in the ship. Therefore we raccd onward as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast as the flier could carry us. For a while the Drulls</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed us closely, continually flashing their heat rays.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they missed us each time and gradually we drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from our enemies, leaving them far behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I examined the space chart and found that the object</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our pursuit was only 45.000 lentors away, so we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were able to slow up our mad rush and thus gain an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity to inspect any damage that we might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered during our fight with the Drulls. I was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved to find that nothing was broken or injured, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exception of the hydrogen ray projector. Since 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to obtain more hydrogen from the space ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we came up with it, this did not worry me great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. Now we had only 32,000 lentors to go before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtook the flier, so Randor again reduced the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our vehicle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	made an effort to communicate with the ship ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us, but was unable to receive any response. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the possibility flashed across my mind that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew might be dead, but then I remembered that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic controls would have1 kept the flier to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">course in event of such a mishap, and as the pilot room</seg><seg type="columnLine">was securely locked on all of these big ships, none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passengers could have interfered with them. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flier was clearly off her normal course and the devi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation was continually increasing at such a regular rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to make it appear the work of some intelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">agency. Meanwhile we had drawn so close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space ship that it was only a matter of moments until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would be alongside of it. We were just about</seg><seg type="columnLine">137 lentors behind when Randor turned to me with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">air of bewilderment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir, our flier does not respond properly to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trols."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you sure?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, it would seem as if someone has cut down</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MESSAGE FROM SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">339</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the power of the magnet ray. If I may venture to</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggest it, I would advise that you try to get in touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Astrax and call for an emergency ship as the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trols are getting harder to manage every moment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went to the sound-proof phone booth and lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instrument from the table on which it was resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pressed a small lever. There was no response. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicator light which glowed when the phone was ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for use was not lit. I examined the instrument very</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully and at last came to the conclusion not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the magnet rays been weakened, but the electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">power impulses which were transmitted to us from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Astrax had been also tampered with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went back to the control room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Randor, it seems that you're right. The space phone</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't work although it's in perfect condition.

What is the course?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are moving parallel to the ship ahead of us al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though at a greater speed and I can't do anything to</seg><seg type="columnLine">change our direction. There is no doubt that our flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">is being guided by some power beyond our control. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, in addition to the magnet rays failing to function,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power impulses are ceasing to reach us, and we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether cut off from our planet. I can't say that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospects for the immediate future are particularly al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luring."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tn that case, there is nothing we can do about it so</seg><seg type="columnLine">we may as well take a rest. Then we will be in better</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition for whatever happens next." Before I lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">down I walked over to the space chart to ascertain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">position of the flier ahead of us. I was rather startled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find that it was now only 17 leu tors away, although an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spection of the respective motions of the two ships con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmed Randor's assertion that they were traveling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">parallel courses. Then I sank down and fell asleep. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">long I slept I have no idea, but judging from the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered during that period the time must have been con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN, jarring my sleeping brain, came a loud, im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient clanging of the space phone bell, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicator light continually flashed 011 and off, showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that someone was at the other end of the line.

Your progress is now being ac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">celerated by certain means at our disposal and the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are following will shortly lead you to my planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">where everything will be made clear including the reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your capture. Goodby." With that the voice sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly stopped. I was furious. The idea of being cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured in this outrageous fashion by a race of whom I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never heard, without a chance to do anything about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it! At once I called in all the rest of those on the flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">and acquainted them with the communication I had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">received. To give the inhabitants of Extrose full credit</seg><seg type="columnLine">their science must be of an unusually high order to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able them to get in touch with us so readily and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time to be informed of events occurring millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sortors away, I thought. And then, in addition, to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">our language. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is needless to give an account of the succeeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">days which passed until we reached the planet Extrose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a repetition of what has just been recounted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternate speculation and damnation regarding the Super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Intelligences of Extrose. On the twenty-first day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space flying we were aware of a sudden increase in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of our vehicle. We looked out of a window and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were astonished to find that the customary pin points of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars had vanished. More careful observation showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole sky swallowed up in a huge, black bowl. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">I correctly supposed to be the dark sun ExLrose. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily consulted the space chart and was relieved to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the other flier was still in its relative position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then our sudden acceleration began to decrease as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gently drawn down to the surface of Extrose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From a nearer position I could see that portions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness beneath us were illumined with a dull radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, which became visible only at a close range. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">areas of light were roughly circular in shape and, as our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship approached one of them, they proved to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings of great shafts, which apparently went far be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low the surface. At this point the bell summoned me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space phone and the strange voice again began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These deep shafts which you see extend almost one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter of the length of the diameter of Extrose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then open into our cities, which are far below the surface.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are so situated because most of the atmosphere has</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitated toward the center, as this planet is pierced</seg><seg type="columnLine">through and through with deep, cavcrnous pits which</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupy a considerable amount of the total volume. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were compelled to follow the atmosphere as it gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally left the surface to move in toward the interior" You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not be able to leave your ship until you reach the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom of the shaft which you are now descending. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is nothing you can do but to wait till you arrive. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do arrive, I will send further instructions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately I told the crew of this incredible mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage. A whole civilization buried hundreds of lentors</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the surface of a planet! But that time our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs were of more direct interest to us. On looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">through one of the side windows, I could easily see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were rapidly falling down the great shaft just as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice had said. A glance at the space chart showed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that now the other flier was only three lentors ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. At least it was some consolation to know that friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so near.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The descent through the shaft continued for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and while we waited for it to cease there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great deal of discussion and speculation concerning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposes of the Super-Intelligences of Extrose in cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turing two Astrakian fliers. Randor thought it might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">340</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of a hoax, but I was not of this opinion. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">all seemed very much in earnest. With this idea in mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I carefully enjoined the crew to show no signs of hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tility when we arrived at the city. Force could be of no</seg><seg type="columnLine">avail in the very stronghold of the enemy. Only by gain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their confidence and trust could we hope to improve</seg><seg type="columnLine">our situation. To this they all agreed. Again I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the windows, only to perceive that we were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling down that seemingly interminable shaft. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, through the bottom window I could see a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow, and then I knew that the city was close at hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a shorter time than I had expected the ship came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden halt, and I saw that we had landed on a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform surrounded by rows of powerful lights. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other flier was so close that I was about to leave our</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicle and run over to it when I heard the bell ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, calling me to the phone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are warned," the voice began, "not to leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier, under any circumstances whatsoever, until given</seg><seg type="columnLine">permission by me. An infringement of this command</seg><seg type="columnLine">will invite severe punishment. You may. however, watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">subsequent proceedings through a window. They will</seg><seg type="columnLine">concern the other flier which came with you." As be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore I informed the crew of what I had just heard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we all went to a side window which faced the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">space ship. For a while the platform was vacant except</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the two fliers. Then, for the first time, T saw an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Extrosian. I thought I was prepared for any sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange creature which might appear, but the thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally came up on the platform left me breathless in</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IMAGINE, if you can, a small, green sphere glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a peculiar phosphorescent gleam and propelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself by darting slender purple rays from various points</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its surface. The Super-Intelligence slowly moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the other flier and halted a short distance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the&gt; door. For a moment nothing happened. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small, red disk of light appeared upon the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere. Somehow I felt that it was concentrating all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power of its mighty brain upon the. occupants of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space ship. So great was the intellectual power oi the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Extrosian that even I, although not the intended recipi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent of its mental communication, could sense the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand which it wished to convey. Those within the flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ordered to leave it and to come down to the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. The door opened and one by one they came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and climbed down. I recognized none of them, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">their flier did not use any of the landing stages in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">division. As they left the shelter of the ship they suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered no ill effects. From this I gathered that the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere and the gravitation of Extrose were very simi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar to those of Astrax. Then the pilot of the flier and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Extrosian carried on a mental conversation. By this</seg><seg type="columnLine">I mean that the intellectual capacity of the Green Sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so great that it was able to read the thoughts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Astrakian even before they were translated into speech.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the other hand, the ideas of the Super-Intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so forcibly transmitted that, even to the compara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively dull mind of the pilot, they were clear without</seg><seg type="columnLine">being orally expressed. Of course I could not read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts of the pilot, but those of the Super-Intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">were obvious and, therefore, I can only give a one-sided</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dumnos Veltran, pilot of space ship #A38B36," be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan the Extrosian, "as I have previously explained, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been made a prisoner, along with those with you,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Super-Intelligences of Extrose. 1 did not, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, make the reason very clear. Now I will proceed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do so." From this preliminary speech I knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">those in the other flier had received the same messages</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Extrosians that we had. At once I was all at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention, for now I was to know the answer to many per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexing questions that had always been troubling me</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever since the beginning of this strange adventure. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast a hasty glance around my ship and observed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew was no less interested in the proceedings than I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our whole purpose in bringing you here," resumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Green Globe, "was to ascertain whether you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to survive the Extrosian conditions of tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, atmosphere, and gravitation. Although, as you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily see. the experiment has been an unqualified suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess, its object must still be a mystery to you. We on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Extrose have always been a . . . What! Do you dare to</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupt me to say that you object to your detention?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you think I brought you here because I thought you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would like it?" It was plain that the pilot must liave</seg><seg type="columnLine">been mentally protesting about his capture so vividly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Extrosian had lost patience with him. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he decided, at last to continue his explanation, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than permit his anger to overmaster him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We on Extrose have always been a most adventurous</seg><seg type="columnLine">race, although you might not draw this conclusion from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cursory glance at our seemingly ineffectual bodies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these globe-like objects. We have certain mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">extensions which enable us to do many things which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be beyond the power of an intelligent sphere. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">example, we could convey to you spoken words over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space phone, although we are without speech organs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But more of that later. As a result we have made quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of planetary conquests, somewhat in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">way that you have done. However, nearly all of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been very unsatisfactory. The atmospheres of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">invaded planets were not like that of Extrose. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to use certain arrangements for taking some</seg><seg type="columnLine">Extrosian atmosphere along with us. For even an Extro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sian needs air, as the cells of his tissues must be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly bathed in this fluid. This unfortunate defect</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed any prospect of their colonization. This has</seg><seg type="columnLine">impelled us to capture you and your space ship, in addi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the other one which came with you. As you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently use our atmosphere without inconvenience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will easily be able to adjust ourselves to yours. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand that this short account will leave many things</seg><seg type="columnLine">still unexplained. How did I bring your space ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">here? How did I cut off its magnet rays? For the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">being these questions will have to remain unanswered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let it suffice to say that to a Super-Intelligence many</seg><seg type="columnLine">things are possible that to an ordinary mind would seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible. Now that we have found that the conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">existing on your planet, which you call Astrax, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorable to Extrosian life, we intend to take possession</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. After all, it is a case of the survival of the fittest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No doubt you wonder that I divulge all this so casually,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you must remember that your information will be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">no avail, and even if you were to escape and warn your</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, it would not help in the slightest degree. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all for the present." Then the thought impulses of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Green Sphere ceased and the red spot faded and van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was stunned when I realized the full import of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">message of the Extrosian. There was absolutely nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be done about it. Escape was impossible. Even if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">got through the shaft, they could easily draw us back as</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MESSAGE FROM SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">341</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they had done before. I surveyed the group on the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. For a while they stood silent. Then suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dumnos Veltran acted. With a cry of mingled rage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">despair he hurled himself upon the Globe before him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgetting that that powerful mind could easily read his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts and anticipate his actions. All those with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed, and before I could say a word, the crew of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my flier burst open the door and joined their country-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. I alone stayed back, realizing the futility of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an attempt. The Sphere remained motionless until its</seg><seg type="columnLine">attackers were almost upon it. Then the red spot sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">into life and the gleam on its surface pulsated and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightened. Instantly every Astrakian on the platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stricken to a statue-like pose right in the middle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a movement and dropped to the floor. Then the Extro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sian addressed itself to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are all dead, killed by the power of mental sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestion. I trust, for your own sake, that you will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wisdom to venture no such attack yourself. The in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vasion of your planet will begin very soon. But now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must first acquaint the members of the Supreme Council</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Extrose with the successful results of the experiment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think you had better come with me, for if you are left</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone you will probably get into trouble and complicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters." At those words I left the flier and alighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the surface of Extrose. As I have said, the atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere was almost exactly like that of Astrax, and I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perienced no discomfort in that respect. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar, pungent quality in the air which I later learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">was due to the presence of a gas unknown on my planet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Globe led me to a small chamber at the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platform, which we entered. I could see nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a large, gleaming square on one of the walls. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">captor seemed to concentrate all the power of his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this object The red disk glowed as before and soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a picture appeared on the square. I could discern a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly lighted room in which were two long, shelf-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects. On each of these was a row of Extrosians. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took this to be the Supreme Council which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">alluded to before. This room, too, had a square placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one of the walls in which I could see the image of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber in which 1 was. One of the Globes at the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treme end of the row nearest the square rose from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">place and moved over to it. At once the red spot which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew so well began to gleam, and I surmised that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two Extrosians were having a mental conversation. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought waves used were so faint that I was unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to intercept them. It was soon over. The members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Supreme Council seemed very well impressed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the news. Many of them, in their enthusiasm, started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move about the room on their purple rays. The red</seg><seg type="columnLine">spots on their surfaces glowed as they carried on excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">communications. Then the picture suddenly vanished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Sphere began to transmit more mental impulses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have seen how much the information was wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comed by the Council. I was told that the invasion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Astrax will commence as soon as all the Extrosians are</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquainted with the plan and the space ships are made</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready. This will not take very long. I am to be put in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of the expedition and you are coming with me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leading flier. It would be better for you to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your vehicle while I go to make arrangements."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'C'OR the first time I got an opportunity to mentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">A review the situation. Everything had happened so</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly and there had been such a sudden crowding of</seg><seg type="columnLine">events that my mind was almost dazed. It was naturally</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible for me to entertain any feeling but hatred for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Extrosians. They killed my crew in cold blood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even now were preparing to take possession of my planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">by force. And yet, at the same time, I realized that any</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of emotion was foreign to them. Everything they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did was the direct result of their adventurous spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">which knew no obstacle. My countrymen, so ruthlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed, had been regarded simply as annoyances. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was maddening to sit there quietly while knowing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible, inevitable doom in store for my planet. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of impotence was unbearable. The Extrosians</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going to put me in the leading ship so that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a good view of the. annihilation of the inhabitants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Astrax. Oh, the irony of fate! I was interrupted in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of my thoughts by the return of the Green Globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can see you are distressed over the disaster which</seg><seg type="columnLine">your planet is going to experience so soon," it began.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, there's no use in worrying about the inevitable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why don't you take a more rational view? After all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is nothing you can do to avoid it, so you might as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well make the best of things. You will probably become</seg><seg type="columnLine">innured to Extrosian conditions so soon, while you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us, that you will prefer to return to this planet. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">far you have seen practically nothing of our scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">development. Compared to yours, it is marvelous." But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not sympathize with this argument. Astrax was</seg><seg type="columnLine">my home, the base of all my associations. Now it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be destroyed and the civilization of which I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so proud was near its end. But these points were beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the comprehension of the Extrosian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are going to leave very soon now, so I will take</seg><seg type="columnLine">you over to the leading ship." I was led to the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platform where the Globe rested his weight on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small button on the floor. Instandy a trapdoor swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, revealing a long, sloping passage. As we followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">this the door behind us closed automatically. The corri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dor was very much longer than I had thought and, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I walked as rapidly as I could, the Green Sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impatient at the rate of our progress. But, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything else, the passage finally came to an end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It opened into a vast plain, on which reposed many</seg><seg type="columnLine">large, gray shapes. I presumed they were space fliers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The whole scene, at first sight, was one of extreme con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion. Countless numbers of the Green Spheres rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hither and thither as though in ignorance of their desti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations, but I knew that, underlying that seeming scram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble, was a well-arranged and efficient system. My own</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience on Astrax had taught me as much. Near</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of the fliers were vast, complicated masses of ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chinery which were loading materials and supplies into</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. My guide told me that these were operated by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentration of the minds of certain Extrosians upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. These machines were some of the "extensions"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which he had previously spoken. I was informed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no fewer than 160,000,000 Extrosians were going on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition. This huge number represented one-tenth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their entire population. They carried no lethal weapons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">relying wholly on their power of mental suggestion</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had already seen in operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The following events may seem somewhat confused, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am afraid, but that is because in the sudden rush that</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded I had no opportunity to get a clear impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what was happening. I had a vague impression of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide's calling me to the foremost flier, into which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">blundered somehow, while hundreds of Green Globes</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded in on either side. A door clanged shut, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone. I had a sensation of going straight up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">342</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an inconceivable velocity. I knew we were ascending</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the shafts which led to the surface. Then I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived a mental impulse from my guide, informing me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I would find him in the control room. I located this</seg><seg type="columnLine">after considerable difficulty and thus escaped the bustle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turmoil without. Here I saw the Extrosian mentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlling a small instrument which, he told me, regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated the speed as well as the direction of the space ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I asked him to explain the means of propulsion, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">he refused to do, saying that it was a secret. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was forced to admire the skill and case with which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">piloted the flier. He informed me that its velocity was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so great that we would arrive at Astrax in one-third the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it had taken me to cover that distance. The size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the vehicle was about four times that of our largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships, and yet the Green Sphere told me that compared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other Extrosian fliers it was very small indeed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By this time we were through the shaft and just above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of the dead star. (I should explain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Extrose is really a sun and not a dependent planet, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">through habit I have occasionally referred to it by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter term.) There was a window in one wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">control cabin, and through it I could see a steady stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lights pour through the shaft opening. When I real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized that these lights denoted a mighty horde of Extro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sian space ships, I knew that Astrax was hopelessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">doomed. Then, for a while, I preferred not to think at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. Later I asked the Sphere whether it had a name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," it explained, "we have no names. That silly</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom diet! out millions of cycles* ago. Instead we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers. My number is 314-f&gt;6874539. The first part</seg><seg type="columnLine">denotes the rank and the second corresponds to the name.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lower a rank number is, the higher is the position</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicated. I see that you have this rank system yourself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is inevitable in a highly organized civilization. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, as you have been over this route before, can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me whether we may expect to encounter any unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulties on the way? All, yes. I see you are thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Drulls whom we may meet. Let me reassure you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I tell you that they are so low mentally that it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">only require about two or three degrees of mind concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tration to annihilate them as fast as they come. To kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Astrakians it took at least eight degrees. This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">because a more advanced mind is able, to a certain extent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to withstand the thought waves which induce death by</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental suggestion." This was new to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you mean," I asked, "that you have gained such</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect control of your minds that you are able to regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late the exact strength of the thought impulses?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could sense the mental amusement of the Extrosian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For the last 4,000,000 cycles we have been nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but almost solely pure brains equipped with this ray-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of propulsion which you have seen. Originally</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had certain appendages with which we performed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the majority of the necessary tasks. But we found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this distracted us from the pure mental labor, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone of my race likes to indulge in as much as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible. As a result of this condition we have built a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">variety of machines, which are entirely controlled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental power of the operator. It was these machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">that constructed the space fliers. By their aid our power</seg><seg type="columnLine">is practically unlimited, and some day we intend to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quer as much of the universe as is conquerable. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wander from the original point. You may readily see</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> â€¢Translator's Note. A "cyelc" may be the Extrosian equivalent for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year. Prixton Lestex apparently was not interested enough to find what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">corresponded to in his own language.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that since these machines left us free for purely mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">activity, we began to develop our minds to an amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree. When we perfected our ability to project mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulses, all conversations were confined to this method</seg><seg type="columnLine">and consequently our speech organs atrophied. As a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of fact, the only remnants of our original liodics</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we have retained, besides our brains, are our eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And even these have changed. As we learned to depend</seg><seg type="columnLine">on them more and more for maintaining contact with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside world, they gradually grew, and now they in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clude the entire surface of this sphere-like body. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">you may regard the Extrosians as being gigantic eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with brains. No doubt such a form of intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems strange to you and probably repulsive also, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you must remember that every living thing is completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">molded by the environment in which it exists. .If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to trace the circumstances and conditions surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing our development, from the very earliest records of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Extrosian life, you would readily perceive the reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our evolution in this direction." Then I thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain possibilities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With such an organism you should require no nour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nor do we," replied the Globe. "That is one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous advantages of being an Extrosian. And what</seg><seg type="columnLine">is more, our life span has been so tremendously increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">that 85,000 cycles is not an uncommon age among us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is because there are no parts to wear out. But what</seg><seg type="columnLine">does happen is this: You know that the brain is only</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of absorbing a certain amount of knowledge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas. In the case of such a race as your own where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifetimes are so short, this fact is of no account, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably only use a small fraction of your total mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">capacity. But with us it is different. After a very long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the brain becomes saturated and loses the power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">recording any new impression. When this occurs the</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual is no longer conscious of the present but of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past only. Originally, as such a one was of no use</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the community, they used to be painlessly extermi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated. But in the light of advanced science it became</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to make certain operations on them which de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed all the less important impressions and thus par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tially rejuvenated the brain. Each Extrosian can survive</seg><seg type="columnLine">about forty of these treatments which are undergone</seg><seg type="columnLine">once every two thousand cycles. After the brain has</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken more than forty treatments, it grows stale and bc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comcs worn out. Then it is extinguished. I myself am</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively young, for I have as yet only taken eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatments."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps you would like one?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, thanks, I don't think I will need it for some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come." Then for a while we conversed no more, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I again began to think of the terrible fate in store for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my planet. It seemed to me that I had been taking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole thing rather calmly, but, after all, what could I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it? I would have given my life to warn Astrax</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the coming danger, but how could I? There was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a movement I could make which the Green Sphere would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not instantly anticipate. The only thing I could do would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be to wait until Astrax was reached and then, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of landing, attempt to escape. In the meantime</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would try to be as friendly to the Extrosian as possible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly T remembered that even now he might be read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my thoughts, and I turned to look at him. but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely absorbed in controlling the flier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I fell asleep and lost all track of time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MESSAGE FROM SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">343</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN I awoke I found the Extrosian still in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same position. He had not moved since I had last</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen him, and yet I was told that over one-half of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance had been covered. I could not help thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it spoke well for the power of mental concentration</seg><seg type="columnLine">which this race possesses. Through the front window I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see faint points of light far in the distance. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctively I knew these were Dnill space ships. I in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed the Extrosian of this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Yes," he answered, "they are Drull ships. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were there a long time ago. As I explained before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll be able to subdue them by thought waves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's all right, but they have a heat ray which could</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy this ship instantly. On the way here we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly victims of it ourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry. They'll never get a chance to use it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will give a few orders and the Drulls will be done for."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Globe turned to a small, shiny square on one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls such as I had seen before, and the red spot on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface glowed more vividly than ever. One by one</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of the captains in charge of the space ships jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into view, vanishing almost at once. Yet in that brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of their appearance the Extrosian had been able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give each of them an order. Then the sphere asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to look through a rear window. I could see a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of shining points of light, each of them representing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a space flier. Gradually the line began to bend at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center, until it took the shape of a crescent, with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier in advance at the center. From end to end the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have been no less than 350 lentors in length. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sphere informed me that the object of these tactics was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent any of the Drull ships from escaping for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line was to surround them, forming a circle. Now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy was only a thousand lentors away and they made</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to attack us. Even at that distance I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heat rays flashing, although they could not harm us</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we were so far away. Each moment now the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleets were coming closer and closer. Then the Globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the front window and the red spot glowed again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the foremost of the Drull fliers began to wob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble in its path and then dropped out of sight. Simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneouly almost all the other enemy ships followed suit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But even so a considerable number remained to endanger</seg><seg type="columnLine">us with their heat rays. These came toward us at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high rate of speed. Just as I thought we were within</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach of their rays, they too began to act erratically and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged downwards after the rest of the fleet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Extrosian was elated over the overwhelming suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess of the battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," he explained, "the whole thing was ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surdly simple. I merely had to project my thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves into the brains of the Drulls and thus command</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to direct the ships' courses downwards before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">died. This carried all of them out of the way, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't likely that they will come back very soon. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered all the other Extrosians in command of fliers to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do the same."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have your thought waves any limiting range?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course the range varies with the mental power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the projectors, but the average is about twelve times that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the heat rays." I saw a new hope for my planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I don't think your invading expedition will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">very successful, as we have certain weapons which are</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficient over distances many times greater than that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For example, we have an atomic disintegrator which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would cause the atoms of this flier to collapse instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," interrupted the Globe impatiently, "I know all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that. We Extrosians abandoned that device thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of cycles ago. As a matter of fact, I read in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind that the Astrakians have been making use of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument, and as a precaution I have ordered that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fliers be covered with a film of solid hydrogen. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't be able to attack us while we are in the air, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we land there will not be any danger cither. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">they should use their rays, then they will wreck Astrax,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so a victory would be too dearly bought." This brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">home the realization of my planet's impending doom</seg><seg type="columnLine">more forcibly than ever. What possible chance could it</seg><seg type="columnLine">have against an invading army of Super-Intelligences</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose giant intellects had foreseen every possible con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingency? Then I determined to do something that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely enough, had never occurred to me before. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to the Extrosian and earnestly pled for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. Since his position and rank were very high, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that if I could persuade him to abandon the inva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion and go back to Extrose, his decision would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">contradicted. I told him of the beauties of my planet, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its highly organized civilization, of the scientists in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower levels who ceaslessly toiled for the betterment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Astrax, of its airways and of its interplanetary trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports. In short, of practically every development that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my planet had produced. All in vain. The Sphere could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see only from one viewpoint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know, 1 think I shall lose patience with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">continual mourning over the approaching end of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">race. After all, what purpose is there in life but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancement of science ? Can't you understand that your</seg><seg type="columnLine">boasted civilization is really of a decidedly low level any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way? You talk of the 'beauties of Astrax.' What good</seg><seg type="columnLine">do 'beauties' do ? Do they assist in the erection of labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tories or of scientific instruments and machines? No.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They merely encourage indolence and vague dreaming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You say that your civilization has constantly devoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself to the service and development of science. May I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask you what outstanding advances you have made in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that line? 'The trouble is that you permit queer, senti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental ideas to interfere with your progress. When you</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be delighted that your place on Astrax is going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be taken by a superior race of higher achievements, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">bemoan the fact. Now is that a true, scientific spirit ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw that it was more than useless to plead with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange creature, who recognized not a single idea in life</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the advancement of science and the urge of adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. What could a rational being answer to an argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment like that? And yet, after a little reflection, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand the reason for these perverted ideas. As a</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization of pure brains, they had practically nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which to concern themselves but intellectual labors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As a result every idea relating to personal pleasure or</seg><seg type="columnLine">esthetic appreciation of the beautiful had died a natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. That was my way of accounting for the Globe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar mental attitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that I made no more allusions to the fate of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. At least I had done all I could and no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be expected of me. I asked the Green Globe what</seg><seg type="columnLine">would happen to me when everyone else on Astrax was</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposed of. I learned that so long as I did not interfere</seg><seg type="columnLine">with any of the subsequent Extrosian procedures nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be done to me. I could not help thinking that that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of a life would be a lonely one--wandering through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the levels of Astrax and reflecting on the life and activity</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had loved so well, now gone forever. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I would never feel at home with the Extrosians.</seg><seg type="columnLine">344</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You will get used to it like everything else, as I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you before," the Globe told me. "But you never seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to realize that fact and I'm not going to drill it into your</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubborn mind any more. Perhaps you will be interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know that we have almost reached Astrax. It's that</seg><seg type="columnLine">small disk of light you see through the front window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is only 3,000,000 of your lentors away, and at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">present rate it will not take very long to cover the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance." I felt a throb of emotion as I gazed on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright, shining light which I knew was my home. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE flier was traveling so rapidly that the visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">disk of Astrax began to enlarge appreciably each</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant until it soon filled the entire heavens. Already I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized the characteristic markings of those conti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nents which faccd me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Sphere decided that it would be better to try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect a landing on the dark side of the planet, so accord-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly the entire Extrosian fleet swung around in a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle until it reached the other hemisphere of Astrax.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, the vigilant Astrakian fliers were on the look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and immediately great signal flares were lighted all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the surface of the planet. At the same time a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">horde of space ships rose from the ground as if by magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began to ascend above the limits of the atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a point where they could operate their Wexton ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines. The Extrosians, despite their superior intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lects, had not anticipated this maneuver, and so were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to flee from under the Astrakian fleet, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the range of their thought rays. The Green</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sphere decided on a route which led to one of the largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities. The Extrosian fliers flew rapidly overhead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">by projected thought impulses killed off nearly two-thirds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the population. This action was repeated again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and each time one of the major cities of Astrax</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reduced to a metropolis peopled by corpses. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course the inhabitants of each of the big cities had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered by the General Astrakian News Agency to leave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but their numbers were so great that the process of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parture took considerable time, and this afforded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Extrosians an opportunity to catch up with them. Mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the Astrakian fleet had overtaken us and was rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a perfect shower of the atomic rays, even at the risk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of endangering their own cities. This menace grew to</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarming proportions as more and more Astrakian fliers</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined their comrades. The Green Globe then deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined to attack the enemy on its own ground. So, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of killing off the citizens below, it turned its atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the fliers above. Soon the whole Extrosian fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">was high in the air, rapidly approaching the Astrakians.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Already they had lost nearly sixty ships through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic ray machines while the Astrakian fleet was as yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">intact. But now, when we were at close quarters, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spheres had a chance to project their mental waves, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a moment dozens and dozens of hostile space ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell to sure destruction upon the surface of the planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">many lentors below. At this sudden reversal of condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions the Astrakians began to take alarm and accordingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of them tried to flee from the range of the Extrosian</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought rays. But this they were unable to do. The in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vading ships were very much faster and the Astrakian</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicles had not a chance of escaping them. Moreover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they saw so many of their ships suddenly drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">downwards, they lost their courage and even neglected to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">use the ray machines. Thus all of them fell victims to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Extrosians, and the Astrakian fleet was no more. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">then dropped all the way to the surface and prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to emerge. The Green Sphere informed me that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not going to make any attempts to get into communica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with the remaining inhabitants, as he was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">exterminate all of them anyway. His annihilation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fleet had left no doubt of his intentions. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">alighted near one of the large cities and all of the Extro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sians left the ship. I begged to be permitted to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, as I could not bear to be seen in the company of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these invaders by any of my fellow creatures. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the Sphere seemed to hesitate when I requested</seg><seg type="columnLine">this privilege, but he decided finally to leave me in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I warn you," he added, "not to leave. I am not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even going to leave a guard, as you aren't worth the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. If you go away it will be your own fault if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">get killed, since none of the other Extrosians know you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he was gone and all the rest of the Globes with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a long time I thought over the situation. Then, sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, 1 made up my mind and I acted at once. By a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange coincidence the city near which we had landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the same one in which I had been engaged as Land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Stage Inspector, so I knew it thoroughly. I left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier and ran as rapidly as I could to the city and there I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed with the terrified mobs. T believe that of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands there awaiting destruction, I was the only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a set purpose in mind. I went to the nearest build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and soon found my way to a shaft leading to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom levels. Down I went to level #1. Even here the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place was deserted. Knowing their doom was at hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scientists who worked there preferred to die in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of day rather than deep in the heart of the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I went about I had been hastily gathering food, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the time I reached my destination I was loaded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this necessity. At last I came to a small chamber which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had formerly been a secret office of the Astrakian Space</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ship Co. Under a cabinet at one side of the room was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small trapdoor of which I alone knew. I pulled a small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden lever and the door opened. I climbed down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled another lever. There was a tremendous explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the entire building above me crashed into ruins, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">effectively sealing my retreat, which I had always ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for just such a catastrophe as this.

Knowing even as we did</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was but a lifeless mechanism now, without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council's members connected to it, it was yet with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">awe that we stared toward that great mechanism, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose voice we had listened so short a time before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Much would I have given to have examined it, to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspected whatever strange mechanism lay within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe, but time now was our enemy. Soon the signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come that would send the millions of Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">on dark and sunward sides streaming across Triton to</seg><seg type="columnLine">change their sides. And unless we could steal one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders and escape before that signal came, we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitably be discovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, sparing only a glance toward the great silent globe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and I moved silently across the great Council</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment, toward one of the low doors in it that led</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently toward the dark side of Triton, to our right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cautiously we passed through that door, finding ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">in another anteroom compartment, as empty now as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one through which we had already come. Swiftly we</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved across it, in the great floating leaps that each step</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ours made now, toward the door in it that led in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the dark side. But even as we moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward that door, as we stooped to pass through it, Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin and I shrank suddenly back, appalled. For as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent toward that door, the sound of staccato voices had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to us from just ahead, and we had seen in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment that there were Neptunians in the next com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment, several armed with ray-tubes, who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming straight toward that door, straight toward us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment we glanced wildly about through the dusky</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment as they came toward us, then we had leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside from the door, had reached one of the compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment's corners, leaping more than a score of feet toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">that corner and crouching there in the dusk, even as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen Neptunians came through the door! It was our</seg><seg type="columnLine">one chance of escaping them, the chance that they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">not perceive us in the compartment's corner through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twilight dusk that reigued in it. But I knew that so</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen were their great bulging multiple eyes that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">against hope that I hoped. The Neptunians who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come into the compartment, however, seemed not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice us as they entered, passing across it toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great Council compartment, conversing among them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves in their snapping speech-sounds as they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. .Tensely we crouched there, stiffening suddenly, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw one of the disk-bodied monsters suddenly turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and glance back across the compartment in our direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in the next moment he had turned back, not seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and then they had passed through the opposite door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their strange voices passing from our hearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin and I straightened, with long breaths of relief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Close, Hunt!" he whispered. "But on to the dark side</seg><seg type="columnLine">--we've little enough time left!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're almost out of the twilight band now," I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, "and in the dark side we'll be a little safer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND now we were moving quietly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door from which the approach of the Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">had startled us, through the compartment beyond it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on through another and another. These compartments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the twilight band seemed for the most part quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty, filled neither with masses of working Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">like those of the sunward side, nor masses of sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians like those of the dark side. We had found,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, that the compartments of the twilight band</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in fact used only for the housing of the Council of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thirty and of the other activities and departments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rulers of the Neptunians, their only purpose aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that being to provide easy access from the dark to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunward side of Triton, and vice versa. So it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that now as we crept through the twilight dusk of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartments, we found them almost wholly empty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenantless, though once or twice we were forced again</seg><seg type="columnLine">to seek hiding in the shadows as we heard the staccato</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices of Neptunians in the distance. Once, too, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were startled by one of the cylinders throbbing by close</seg><seg type="columnLine">above us, and since we had had no time to hide from it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought ourselves discovered by it, though after tense</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes it became plain that its occupants load not seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But soon the twilight of that narrow band was deepen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and almost at once, it seemed, we were moving from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that twilight dusk into a deep darkness that obscured</seg><seg type="columnLine">all things about us. W'e had reached the dark side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton, we knew, and now moved more carefully still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for upon that dark side, we knew equally well, slept half</seg><seg type="columnLine">the massed millions of the Neptunian races. The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">few compartments which we traversed in that darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, were as empty as those in the twilight behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. But then, as we moved silently on, we came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first of the great sleeping-compartments. Even like</seg><seg type="columnLine">those which had puzzled us so on Neptune it was, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its towering walls lined with intersecting shelves whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings, twice as long as they were high, were ranged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows, one above the other, like giant pigeon-holes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This sleep-compartment, though, was not empty like</seg><seg type="columnLine">those upon Neptune, for in its hundreds of shelf-open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, its great pigeon-holes, there slept hundreds upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of the disk-bodied Neptunians! Their seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">short limbs folded up around their disk-bodies, they re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed in those openings with their bulging, glassy eyes as</seg><seg type="columnLine">open as ever. It was evident they all were sleeping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the dimness of the day upon Neptune had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">lids for those eyes unnecessary in the evolution of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange race. And eery was that sight to Marlin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, as we stepped silently into and across the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep-compartment. For it seemed to us that the hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of Neptunians reposing thus in those wall-openings</seg><seg type="columnLine">were regarding us fixedly with their great multiple eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching us as we moved across the compartment. None</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred, though, as we made our way across it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite door, and moved into the next, which we found</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be another sleep-compartment also, its wall-openings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, holding hundreds of the sleeping monsters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through a dozen such sleep-compartments we went,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving with infinite quiet and care, lest any of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping thousands about us be aroused by any sound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And almost it seemed to Marlin and me as we crept on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that that hope was ended in any case, since so far we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found none of the landing-compartments for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we searched, none of the cylindrical fliers in which alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could escape. We had passed through other com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">349</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">partments that held the great heat-radiating globes, now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">great glowing globes whose intense heat was not radiated</seg><seg type="columnLine">out horizontally at all, but sent up in vertical heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">currents, which by convection in some way warmed all</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton's atmosphere. Past these and through still more</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep-compartments we went, pausing now and then as</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the distance in the dark side there reached us a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few staccato voices; still we came not upon any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing-compartments for which we searched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despair was growing in me as we crept on through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep-compartments, through the thousands of slumber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Neptunians. For soon would come the signal that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would awaken all those Neptunians about us, I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unless we found a landing-compartment, a cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we might steal before then, all was lost. Even with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a cylinder, indeed, little enough hope was ours, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">we dared not attempt to get to the twenty controls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great sun-ray across the swarming sunward side. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest hope would be to escape from Triton in it, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible through the great roof that surrounded Triton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but even that hope seemed a futile one now, since, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on and on through the dense darkness of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping side of Triton, we were moving still through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">maze of sleep-compartments, groping blindly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast checkerboard maze of intersecting, towering walls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as we came into still another of the. sleep-compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, widi its massed sleeping Neptunians in the wall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings around it, I halted beside Marlin, twitched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Marlin!" I whispered. "That signal will be coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon--this dark side's sleeping millions will be waking</seg><seg type="columnLine">around us, and we've seen no sign of cylinders yet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must go on, Hunt!" he whispered tensely. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">our only chance now--to get to one of the cylinders be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore they awaken!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But if we were to head in a different direction-11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I began, then was abruptly silent, stiffening suddenly, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin did, beside me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For there, across the dark compartment from us it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to us that one of the sleeping Neptunians in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall-openings had moved!

Before either could utter such a cry, we two had shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air and were upon them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So astounded were they with our appearance and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">supernatural leap across the compartment, that before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could put themselves into a posture of defense, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had struck them, had knocked them to the floor and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">grappling with them. In that first moment of contact I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached for the mouth-opening of the disk-bodied</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster at whom I had leaped, had gripped that opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the top of its disk-body to prevent its outcry and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">had striven to lift the tiling sidewise, to hurl it against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor. But great as was my strength against Triton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesser gravitation, the strength of the Neptunian I held</seg><seg type="columnLine">was greater still, and its weight, due to the weight-disks</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn by it, was enormous. In an instant its seven great</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs were clutching for me, grasping me, and as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained there against that great monstrous disk-body's</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip, I knew with fatal certainty that never could I match</seg><seg type="columnLine">my strength against its own. For even as I struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately with it, Marlin struggling as wildly with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other beside me, the thing was lifting me with its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">great limbs from the floor!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upward it drew me with those powerful limbs, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulging glassy eyes staring from its disk-body's edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight into my own, as we grappled desperately in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark compartment with the sleeping Neptunians all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us! I felt myself being overcome, my strength puny be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the strength of that monster, and as I clutched wildly</seg><seg type="columnLine">still at the month-opening in the top of the disk-body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thrust my clenched fist down into that small round</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth-opening, half by chance and half by design, clos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it thus with my balled fist. Instantly the creature's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body turned and twisted frantically, its grip upon me for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten for the moment, its whole body's mass seeming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">heave and twitch as my hand thus ait off the passage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">air into that mouth-opening, into its body! I was throt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tling it, I knew, and hung fiercely to my grip upon it, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched hand still within its mouth-opening, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing swayed and tore at me with ever-decreasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. A moment more and its struggles ceased, it col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapsed limply to the floor, and I staggered up again to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a single glance I saw that the other Neptunian had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped Marlin and was crushing him against a corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the compartment's shelving and instantly, with a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">great leap, I was upon that other monster, had gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it the same throttling grip which I had found was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so deadly to these creatures. In a flash the Neptunian</seg><seg type="columnLine">had released his hold upon Marlin, was whirling me</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the compartment, shaking me this way and that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wildly attempting to tear itself loose from me, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the last of my .strength I hung to it, and in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments it, too, had weakened, then had slumped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a lifeless, grotesque mass.

None other of the Neptunians had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused by the noise of our mad combat, because in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first excitement of that combat the two Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">we fought had not thought to cry out, and after I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained that throttling hold upon them they could not. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">around us the silent ranks of Neptunians slept on un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused, their open, glassy eyes full upon us even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sleep, while Marlin and I were stumbling toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the compartment's door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On, Hunt!" he whispered hoarsely.

Through the sleep-compartments, with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of open-eyed and sleeping disk-bodied Neptu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nians, through the compartments where reared the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing globes whose radiated heat alone held back the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold doom that so long had threatened these strange be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. through compartment after compartment in a flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">made more grotesque and unreal to us by the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of our progress; by the strange, great, smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaps .that we made instead of steps, great floating leaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a score of feet in which we rushed through the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping compartments, reckless now of the few Neptu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nians who might be waking and moving upon the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Then suddenly as we leaped toward the door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">still another sleep-compartment, poised an instant to leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">through that low door, we halted, gazed with abruptly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaring hope ahead. For the next compartment, we saw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a rectangular one and greater in size than any we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed through as yet, and in it there stood the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming shapes of a score or more of the cvlinder-fliers</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we sought!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With hearts pounding Marlin and I crouched in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">low door, gazing through the darkness toward those great</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders, that gleamed a little in the feeble light that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down upon Triton's dark side from the stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the great roof overhead. We saw that the low</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors in the sides of those cylinders, near the bases, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, and from them there came to us the throbbing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mechanisms, inside 1 It was evident that these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the countless cylinders used to help in transport-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the Neptunian hordes from dark side to sunward side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Triton, and vice versa, and it was equally evident from</seg><seg type="columnLine">those throbbing mechanisms' operation, that the hour of</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakening for those hordes was at hand and that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were waiting for that awakening. For there stood also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">between us and the nearest of the cylinders, three tube-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed Neptunians who were conversing in brief, snap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping speech as they waited!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR the moment, at sight of those cylinders, Marlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I came near to throwing ourselves toward them</seg><seg type="columnLine">regardless of the three, but that we knew would be sui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cide. so despite our torturing agony of soul we waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in the doorway, gazing desperately toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders. And in a moment, as we sought in vain for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">some way to get to the nearest of those cylinders, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a final staccato order from one of the three Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunians and at that order the other two turned and passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a door in the landing-compartment's side opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us. It was our chance, the chance for which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hardly dared to hope even, and no sooner had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two Neptunians disappeared through the opposite door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other standing with his eyes following them for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, than Marlin and I had crept out a little bit into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing-compartment and then with a great simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneous leap had shot through the air toward that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining Neptunian!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no chance for resistance on the crcature's</seg><seg type="columnLine">part.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing threshed wildly, then it, too, had gone limp, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had collapsed. And in the next instant Marlin and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rising from it, were leaping across the compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment toward the open low door of the nearest great cyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inder, from whose great gleaming upright bulk before us</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the throbbing of its powerful generators. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, a dozen feet from it, we stopped dead, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin came a hoarse cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For at that moment there had swept over us, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, past us, from the direction of Triton's sunward side</seg><seg type="columnLine">across its surface, a band of intensely brilliant white light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white light that blazed brilliant for the moment all around</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, turning the changeless night of Triton's dark side</seg><seg type="columnLine">around us for the moment into a white and blinding day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then sweeping swiftly on, around Triton's surface!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the great signal of awakening, the signal for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of sleeping Neptunians about us to awake and</seg><seg type="columnLine">change places with the swarming millions upon the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward sitle! And even as that dazzling signal came, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and I stood stupefied there for the moment before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the looming cylinder's open door, there came from all</seg><seg type="columnLine">around us, from over all the dark side's great extent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all its maze of sleep-compartments, a rising babel of</seg><seg type="columnLine">staccato voices, the voices of its awakening Neptunian</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions! Then, before ever we could recover from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupefaction that in that instant held us rooted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot, there had poured into the great landing-compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment from the compartments on all sides of it swarms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hastening Neptunians, swarms of disk-bodied mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters, who in that moment saw us, littered as one a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">great cry of discovery, and in the next moment were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing from all sides toward us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The cylinder!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Marlin's wild cry, that aroused me from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupefaction of amazement that held me.

The next instant I had reached frantically for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, had with one swift motion slid it clanging shut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then as the Neptunian masses outside hurled them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves toward it, Marlin and I were throwing ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">up through the openings toward the cylinder's upper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most section. In one leap I was at the central control-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standarrl, fumbled frantically with the green control-</seg><seg type="columnLine">studs for an agonizing moment, and then, just as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the Neptunians below flinging themselves against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, the great throbbing cylinder shot upward!</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">351</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up over Triton's dark side we rose, a dozen slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-rays criss-crossing about us from beneath in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, and as we glanced momentarily down we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the Neptunians in the landing-compartment beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing toward the other cylinders there! And glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">far across the surface of Triton, we could see all its</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty compartment-city, dark and sunward sides alike,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarming now with Neptunian hordes as the end and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning of their strange day and night periods was sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nalled.

And over the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sunward surfaces of Triton that great mounting roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sound was spreading, as the Neptunian hordes saw our</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild attempt at escape. Up--up--and now we were rac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing close beneath the great roof, transparent from below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the pursuing cylinders drawing ever nearer, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunian occupants more skilled than I in their opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. And now, too, from those uprising, pursuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarms were directed toward us slender pencil-like rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pale light, visible only near their source, concentrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-rays, that would cleave through our cylinder as</seg><seg type="columnLine">through paper!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On and upward--and now as we shot 011, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarming cylinders hurtling hotly after us in wild pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit, with the throb of our generators and the roar of air</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us thundering in our ears, with the wild tumult of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the massed Neptunians on Triton's surface coming dully</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to us from l&gt;eneath, Marlin and T were gazing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense eyes ahead and upward. The great opening, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great sliding section of the roof down through which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come--that was our one chance to escape from Tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton.

From behind, from ahead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from beneath, the cylinders' swarms were converging</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us in that moment, and as instinctively I slowed our</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder's mad rush I looked upward, toward the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The opening-section!"

My one hope had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been that in our stolen cylinder we might deceive those</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards of the great orifice into opening it for us to pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But that hope was gone. Behind and below and before</seg><seg type="columnLine">us were the pursuing swarms of cylinders and the Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunians in the cage-room above knew that something was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong, and had not opened the great circle for us. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were other similar circles, similar opening-sections, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton's roof, but it was too late now to seek them be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause from all about us the swarming, racing cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rushing upon us. In another moment their rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">would shatter us! I heard Marlin, beside me, utter a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation of utter hopelessness as those cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed upon us, held our own cylinder for the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless there in mid-air beneath the great roof's open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-section, and then suddenly reached toward the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol-studs, even as Marlin's hoarse cry was sounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The end, Hunt!" he was crying. "The cylinders are</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost upon us--and the opening-section is closed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The end maybe--but not this way!" I shouted fiercely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same moment sending the cylinder flashing straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward with all its speed. "Hold to your chair, Marlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">--we're going to smash through that opening-section of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as I cried out thus, our cylinder was rising up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward toward the roof with all the power of its throbbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators, hurtling upward at speed unthinkable toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great circle of the opening-section! I was aware in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moment of the crowding swarms of cylinders about</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beneath us loosing toward us a storm of crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-rays that we drove clear of in that instant. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of the Neptunians in the cage-room beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great opening-section rushing wildly abefut as we shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward like the cylindrical projectile of some gji&amp;nt can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non! The next instant I caught the gleam of the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent roof, of the opening-section just above us, Marlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I instinctively crouched lower in our seats, and a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment later there was a blinding, stunning shock that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to split the universe with its detonation. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged up from our seats with awful force. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we straightened up and looked out, we saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder had smashed through the great opening-sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and was throbbing above Triton's mighty roof!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cylinder's ceiling, above us, was crumpled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent badly, but in that moment it seemed a miracle that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wc had lived through that terrible collision. It was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">our awful speed that had saved us, driving us through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening-section's thick metal even as a cyclone will drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragile straws and twigs unbroken through a board. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we looked downward we saw that the swarming pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suing cylinders were massed beneath the crumpled open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-section and that that circle of the opening-section was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly sliding aside, bent and crumpled as it was, to al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low those cylinders to emerge through Triton's roof after</seg><seg type="columnLine">us! And up they came, a full hundred of them, racing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up after us at utmost speed, up from the great metal roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Triton, dark and opaque to our eyes from above, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">up through its atmosphere close on our track!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH the rushing roar of air about us, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbing of our generators, I was aware of Marlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting something beside me. I was gazing ahead for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment, as that wild flight and pursuit passed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Triton's atmosphere. Giant Neptune's cloudy</seg><seg type="columnLine">green sphere bulked gigantic in the heavens before us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and far beyond it was the little fire-disk of the sun. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I turned back to see the hundred pursuing cylinders, get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting ever closer behind us. As I started at the sight, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">became aware of Marlin shouting beside me, and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">352</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">same moment realized the import of his words. I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the throbbing of our generators was halting, hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tating, failing! Our great crash out through the roof had</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken some part of their mechanism and now they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">failing rapidly, and the speed of our cylinder was slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And behind us the scores of onrushing cylinders were</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer--eloser! Already toward us again from them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping the slender pale force-rays, missing us at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance but sweeping close about us. With an utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenseness of body and spirit, Marlin and I watched them</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing closer, as our cylinder shot on through Triton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere. Suddenly another storm of rays had shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swept toward us from behind, and one of those wild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling rays, in a single instant, clove through the cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der's uppermost sides like a sword of fire through card-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, slicing away completely the already-crumpled roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">above us and the upper half-dozen feet of the walls! In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly a flood of icy-cold air rushed in upon us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed in that moment to freeze us through. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same moment the throbbing generators ceased completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to operate, the cylinder slowing swiftly 011 its rush for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, drifting helplessly there in the outer reaches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton's atmosphere, while from behind, like leaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures of prey, the scores of cylinders rushed upon us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither Marlin nor I voiced a cry in that moment. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only stare as if we were automatons, toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">onrushing cylinders, the oncoming doom. We had run</seg><seg type="columnLine">our course at last. It seemed in that moment that all our</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter battle for freedom, our toilsome escape from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell, our flight through Triton's sleeping side, our steal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the cylinder and wild crash upward through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great roof's opening-section--that all this futile flight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ours was reenacting itself with lightning swiftness before</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes. The swarming cylinders were almost on us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding their rays now as they saw us helpless until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were closer, their great mass whirling straight toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. And then, as I gripped the control-standard before</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. expectant in that instant of the end, I saw that on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing mass of cylinders suddenly shattered as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">by gigantic blows from above. I saw the scores of cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders driven this way and that in a single instant with</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal force, even as they rushed to annihilate us! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked dazedly up, was looking up-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The space-flier!" Marlin's insane cry was sounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">there beside me. "It's the space-flierâ– --and Whitely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The space-flier! There high above us and above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuing cylinders it hung, a gleaming faceted ball, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of which I could only gaze stupefied. I saw in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment that down from its lowest ray-opening there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiating toward the cylinders that had been hurtling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mass toward us, a pale, almost invisible great force-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray and that it was that ray's giant pressure that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered the mass of our pursuers, and in an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">had driven their massed cylinders to all sides! Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they broke thus in wild confusion before that swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">great force-ray from above, the space-flier was flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down toward our roofless, drifting cylinder, was hovering</seg><seg type="columnLine">just beside us, touching that cylinder, with the round</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer door in its facet within our reach! In an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and I had clambered to the drifting cylinder's</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, had whirled open that outer door of the space-flier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When we threw ourselves into the little vestibule-cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber or air-lock, shut the outer door, and turned toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ihe inner one, that inner one was opened and Whitely--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitely!--was pulling us inside!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whitely--Randall--" we were babbling in our excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, "we thought you dead--saw fragments of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flier and thought it destroyed-!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No time now to tell you, Marlin--Hunt--" Whitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hurriedly saying. "Those cylinders are forming</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. They're coming up toward us! Head out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton. Randall--full speed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even as he had spoken, Randall, in the control-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, had flashed his hands over the six control-switches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as Marlin and I clambered with Whitely into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other three chairs, we felt ourselves pressed down with</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific force against them as the space-flier shot out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Triton with colossal speed! But at the same mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment the cylinders that had formed again into their close-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grouped mass, had leaped forward with us and the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment saw space-flier and cylinders alike whirling out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the atmosphere of Triton into the empty void of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space! I glanced back, saw that the cylinders were close</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind our hurtling space-flier, flashing after it somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath it, so as to clear its great force-ray shooting back</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Triton and flinging it outward. And as I glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, I saw Triton's dull-gleaming sphere, with the pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant force-ray that stabbed from its side toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, growing each instant smaller! But dead ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, though somewhat beneath our level, there loomed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal green sphere of Neptune, growing in size as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed on at immense speed from its moon!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On we went, and as Randall's hands flashed over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">control-switches. Marlin and Whitely and I staring tense-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly forth with him, we were aware that from the mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">onracing cylinders behind slender force-rays were again</seg><seg type="columnLine">questing toward us, though the range was too great for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to loose them accurately at this terrific speed. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">any moment, though, one of those concentrated, pencil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like rays might cleave through our space-flier in a lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit, and unless we escaped from these relentless pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suers, the space-flier and ourselves were certain of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction. This 1 saw, and saw too that Neptune's colos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sal cloudy sphere lay close before us, so awful was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of our flight and pursuit, and as it loomed gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us, filling the heavens, it was apparent that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would pass close above its surface. Suddenly I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Randall, shouted in his ear above the thundering throb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing drone of our generators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neptune!" I cried. "There's a chance to smash these</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuing cylinders there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how--?" he began. Shouting in his ear, I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained to him the desperate inspiration that had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. I saw his eyes and those of Marlin and White-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly widen as they heard, and then he nodded grimly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched the control-switches tighter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now about us was sounding again the roar of air</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we shot through Neptune's atmosphere, shot above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of the huge planet with the cylinders rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing still at equal speed behind us, their deadly rays stab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing this way and that in slicing sweeps toward us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the cloudy mists of Neptune's upper atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere we flashed, straight onward, with the dark metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the giant world's vast roof clear now to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes far beneath. And as we shot over it I saw Randall's</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip tighten 011 the control-switches, saw him glance back</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the pursuing cylinders, behind and a little beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and then abruptly he had flung open the switch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great force-ray that was driving us on, our rear-ray!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly the speed of the space-flier slowed, and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">split-second the onrushing cylinders, racing on unslow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in that moment, were hurtling past beneath us. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">353</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as they did so, another switch had clicked under Randall's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and straight down upon those cylinders from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flier's bottom was driving down another mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the next instant we had a glimpse of those massed</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders that had been rushing thus beneath us driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">down by the power of our great force-ray with incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceivable speed and force, driven down in a whirling, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused mass toward the vast metal roof of great Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">below! And as our great ray, traveling across their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, drove them thus downward with colossal power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw a moment later the cylinders of that mass crash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing downward against that roof, shattering into crumpled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecked masses of metal upon the mighty structure, an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nihilated with all inside them on that roof as our great</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray drove them down against it! Half at least of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of cylinders perished thus in the first crash down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and before the rest could gather again to whirl up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the attack, our great ray was playing upon them also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing them down upon the great roof of death, until in</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a moment more but a half-dozen of the cylinders re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained intact! And these, as their fellows crashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death beneath us, were gathering and speeding away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this death that smote from above, were going back toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dull-gleaming disk of Triton!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin and Whitely and Randall and I were all cry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out in that moment as the surviving cylinders flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in flight, and then Marlin and I had turned toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">our two friends. "Whitely--Randall--!" Marlin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying. "You escaped those Neptunians that first dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered us, then? We saw the fragments of wreckage</seg><seg type="columnLine">your pursuers brought back, and Hunt and I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed you might still live!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a trick that enabled us to escape," Whitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained. "When they discovered us there beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune's roof--chased us up through that roof and up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the great cloud-belts, I saw that we could not long</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape those pursuing cylinders. So, while Randall drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flier through the mists and while they searched in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those mists for us, I battered and broke with blows of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large tool some of the spare plates and instruments we</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried. Then, as they came closer to us, their force-rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">slicing through the mists in search of us, I cast those</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments loose from the flier, and when they struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the pursuing cylinders in the mists, when those</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders saw the wrecked fragments, they had no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that their force-rays had struck us somewhere in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud-layer and annihilated us. We lay in the shroud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mists until we saw them returning toward Neptune's</seg><seg type="columnLine">surfacc. We realized then that you two had been cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured by whatever manner of creatures these Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, and saw the cylinders, with you in one of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">going down beneath Triton's roof. For days, therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall and I waited around Triton's surface, hoping</seg><seg type="columnLine">against hope to get down inside in some way and find</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, and had almost given up hope, when we saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder you had stolen racing up from Triton, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to save it and you from the pursuing cylinders."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you, Marlin--Hunt--" Whitely continued. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have learned how and why these Neptunians are sending</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth the great ray that is turning the sun faster? We</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that ray and another great ray on opposite sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Triton--Is it not possible that we alone might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to halt that ray?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin solemnly shook his head. "No chance, White-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, for us," he said. "Perhaps no chance even for all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces of earth!" And quickly he told, while Whitely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and Randall listened enthralled, of the captivity of us two</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Triton's strange and swarming world; of the gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">tale of Neptune's past and the purpose of its peoples, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been told us by the great globe of the Council of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thirty; of our desperate escape and flight across the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of Triton and our wild crashing upward through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof and out from Triton. "Wre alone," Marlin con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded, "can never halt cither of those great rays, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">each has countless cylinders and Neptunians within to</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard it, and each has twenty control-boxes of which one</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone can keep it operating. No, our one chance is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get back to earth, to gather there the great fleet of space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliers which the World-President and the World Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gress planned to build in our absence, and to come out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that great fleet with the most powerful weapons avail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able and endeavor to crush these strange Neptunians, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">halt that great ray of doom that is turning the sun ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster! For unless we can do that, unless we can bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's fleet of space-fliers out here and halt the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun-ray, that ray will in sixty days more have finished its</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, will have split the sun and loosed doom upon all</seg><seg type="columnLine">its planets except Neptune! And so it is back to earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we must race now at our utmost speed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Marlin's solemn voice ceased, and there was silence for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment in the space-flier, we four gazing toward each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other without speaking. By then the flier, with the tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous impetus of its flight still driving it forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had swept on and out over great Neptune now, out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant world's cloudy atmosphere and into empty space</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond it. And, with Neptune's giant globe filling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmament behind us, Randall snapped on again our rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray, sent that ray radiating back toward the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">disk of Neptune itself. And then again we were forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep in our chairs as the flier's tremendous speed acceler-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated once more, the flier hurtling with greater and greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity through the gulf of space toward the far little</seg><seg type="columnLine">disk of fire that was the sun, far ahead. For it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it, toward our earth, that we were going from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune, from the solar system's edge, to carry back word</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth of the nature of the doom that hung above it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to gather earth's forces to forestall that doom!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Gathering of Earth's Forces</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STARING ahead into space from the control-chair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our racing flier, I heard Whitely's voice from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side me. "Seventeen days," he was saying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And in two more days we ought to reach earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded abstractedly, gazing ahead. "Two days at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most," T said. "We're inside Jupiter's orbit now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">once through the astcroidal belt, there'll be nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">delay us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For as Whitely and I gazed outward, Marlin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall sleeping now in two of the space-flier's bunks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could sec that we were approaching, indeed, that belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whirling asteroids that marked the division between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four inner and the four great outer planets of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system. To the left, dropping behind us, gleamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gigantic cloud-belted sphere of Jupiter with its stately</seg><seg type="columnLine">train of attendant moons, as great a mystery to us as</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we first had passed it. A side force-ray was hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the flier out still from the mighty planet's attraction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while ahead and to the right from us now gleamed crim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son Mars. Yet it was not these that held the eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitely and myself, nor even the increasing fiery circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">354</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun before us, but the bluish-white little spot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light that was expanding slowly in size and brilliance as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we shot on toward it, the little spot of bluish light that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was our planet, earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For days we had gazed toward that little light-spot as</seg><seg type="columnLine">our space-flier went on and on through the solar system's</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast reaches toward it. For seventeen days, now, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Whitely had said, we had been racing inward from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune at utmost speed on our desperate journey back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our own world. The space-flier's great rear force-ray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing back against giant Neptune, had hurled the flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">in through the outer reaches of our universe with an ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celeration of velocity that was so great as to prove almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">our undoing. For more than once that terrific pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that acceleration on us, despite our shock-absorbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus, had so affected our bodies as to overcome us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with successive fits of nausea and unconsciousness. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, just after we had swept in past great Saturn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its mighty rings, fearful of those great rings after our</seg><seg type="columnLine">former misadventure with them, I had awakened from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my sleep-period to find Randall and Marlin, in the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol-chairs, quite unconscious from the flier's terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">acceleration, the flier itself speeding onward without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">guiding hand on its controls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet despite this we had grimly driven the flier to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost acceleration possible, its speed steadily mounting</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the maximum in those succeeding days that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed inward from Neptune. For behind us Neptune's</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm, green little disk of light, though diminishing stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily in size as we receded from it, seemed like a baleful</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal of doom shining there behind us. For out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune, or rather out from its moon, Triton, the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray of the Neptunians, was still radiating toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun, thus shadowing all the solar system with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cataclysmic doom to come. For, as we flashed inward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin, had used his astronomical instruments to deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine the fact that the sun's rotatory period had now de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased to a little over eight days, and was decreasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">still by the same amount of four hours each day, its spin</seg><seg type="columnLine">accelerated each day by the same amount as the colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray from Triton kept upon its side its unrelenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure. And within half a hundred days more, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, that rotatory period of the sun would have de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased until its huge mass would be spinning once in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every hour, would be spinning then so fast that it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitably be riven asunder into a new double star by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">own centrifugal force, engulfing all its planets save</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune alone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it was that we spared not ourselves but drove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flier in through the solar system toward earth with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a speed unthinkable, almost, using an acceleration that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all but death for us. For the one hope of preventing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that colossal sun-cataclysm, as Marlin had said and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we all knew, was to reach earth soon and then at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">fly back out from earth toward Neptune again with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great space-flier fleet, which, if the World-President and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the World Congress bad not failed us, would be waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">oar earth for us. With that fleet we must sally back across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solar system once more to its outer edge, to great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune, and must fall upon Triton and the giant force-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray that was shooting from Triton to the sun, with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">our power. If we could vanquish the Neptunians long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to destroy the giant sun-ray's mechanism, to halt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ray, we would have halted the acceleration of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's spin, would have saved the sun and its planets from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cataclysmic doom that now threatened them. But if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could not, if the Neptunians with their countless cylin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ders and great weapons were too strong for us, then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could but perish there in struggling with them, since in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that case nothing could halt the doom that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosing from Triton upon the sun and the solar system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as Whitely and I gazed out through the flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier's windows, we knew that scant enough was the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">left for us in which to do these things. Fven if we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe on earth in the next two days, as we hoped, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would remain but little more than forty days before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming of the dread cataclysm that threatened, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would require half that time for the space-fliers of earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make their way back out across the solar system to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune. So that now there lay over my mind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">deepening shadow of impending colossal disaster that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovered over all our minds during the strange days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our racing inward through the solar system, making me</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze somberly enough toward the bluish light-spot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness of space far ahead that was our goal now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To the left, though, Jupiter's great globe had dropped far</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind now, and as I saw that I cut out our side-ray, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned toward Whitely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're at the edge of the asteroidal belt now," I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, "but I'm not going to slow our speed. W'ell just</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash on through it and take our chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded gravely. "I'll wake Marlin and Randall</seg><seg type="columnLine">now to help me keep watch," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later, having done so, Marlin and Randall</seg><seg type="columnLine">freed themselves of the straps of the bunks and climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the flier to take their places beside Whitely in</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching .for the great menacing asteroids. And as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed on through the belt of those whirling perils,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and Whitely and Randall watched for hour on</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour there beside me, though so vast was the maximum</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed at which our flier was going now, more than eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">million miles an hour, that before they could more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a flashing glimpse of a nearby asteroid we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have passed it. We were relying almost wholly on blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to take us through the asteroidal belt at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning speed, yet so desperate was this grim race back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth from the solar system's edge, that we preferred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to trust thus to chance, rather than to slow our speed or</seg><seg type="columnLine">to delay by an hour our arrival on earth. And chance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the time, favored us, for some hours later we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">won through the perils of the asteroidal belt without more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a few split-second glimpses of the great whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres of peril. And then, as we shot across the orbit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mars with the planet's dull red shield still farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right, I began to slow our terrific speed, for by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time the earth was expanding rapidly before us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, too, the sun was flaming before us, in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">halo-like glory of its great corona, with a brilliance blind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to our eyes after the dim shades of Neptune and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon. Yet even with that brilliance dazzling us we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make out plainer and plainer the sphere of earth, seeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our eyes a thin silver-blue crescent as it spun there</seg><seg type="columnLine">between our inrushing flier and the sun, its tiny moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot growing brighter too. Marlin and Whitely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall watching tensely beside me, I cut out altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great force-ray at the flier's rear, which, even when</seg><seg type="columnLine">our speed had reached its maximum, drove us straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">onward and lcept that speed unvarying against the gravi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tational influences from either side which were not large</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to require an opposing side-ray. Snapping that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear-ray out, I sent another force-ray from the flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the earth-sphere ahead, and as that ray struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pushed us back with immense power, the space-flier's</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal speed was gradually decreasing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">355</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONCE more we felt terrific upward and forward pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure in our chairs as the flier's speed steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowed, dropped swiftly from eight million miles an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">to six and then to five and then to three. And as we shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">in thus toward earth, the millions of miles dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">slower behind as our flier's great faceted ball clicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">through space at slower and slower speed, I knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same question was in the minds of my three friends as</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my own. It was reflected in the tensely anxious eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Marlin and the imperturbable eyes of Whitely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unwontedly grave eyes of Randall as the three stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead with me. Would the space-fliers that the World-</seg><seg type="columnLine">President and the World Congress had promised to build</seg><seg type="columnLine">be ready? If not, we knew we certainly could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture out to Neptune and put an end to the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom-ray that the Neptunians were stabbing toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun. So that it was in a growing suspense of spirit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we watched earth's sphere, with its crescent of bluish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">white light at one side, expanding before us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At ever slower speed we were rushing in toward it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at last, moving at but a few hundred thousand miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour by this time, were driving in out of the void</seg><seg type="columnLine">and past earth's shining moon, gleaming in space to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, its great ranges and strange craters clear to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes from its airless surface. But now all our eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth ahead, since now through the drifting cloud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses that floated in its atmosphere we could make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great bluish globe's surface features, could see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">western Europe and North Africa lay in the sunlight in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that crescent of light at earth's side, but that the North</seg><seg type="columnLine">and South Americas lay in the shade of earth's outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, in the darkness of night. It was toward the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-seen outline of North America that I was heading</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flier, for by this time, traveling still more slowly, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity now being less than a thousand miles an hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were entering earth's atmosphere, the rarefied air</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its outer reaches roaring about the flier as it shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Straight to New York--to the World Congress,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin was saying. "There's not a minute to lose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded silently, at the same time snapping out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front-ray of the flier that was slowing our speed as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot toward earth's surface, and as its gravitation gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flier we were turning until instead of rushing onward</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were falling to its surface from high above, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned in space before us, falling down toward the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the North American continent, whose outline was</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible from our great height through the shifting cloud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen. I felt my heart beating rapidly as we shot thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward, forgot almost the mighty import of the mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion on which we were returning in the mere fact of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">return; for we were first of all men to venture thus into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer void and to return from that void to earth!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as we shot downward I saw the same thought mir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rored in the faces of the others, staring down with inc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down--down--with an oblique ray I was making the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flier fall slantingly, more and more slowly, toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the northeastern coast of the continent beneath, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad, brown surface stretched out greater and greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath us. Moments more and as the roar of air</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us intensified, mingling with the throbbing of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators, we shot down from the sun's light into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness of this dark side of earth, this night of earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side. But now its great surface was changing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">convex to concave beneath us, and now as we shot lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">still Randall pointed downward and northward with a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry toward a spark of bright red light, the beam of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">great air-beacon of the trans-Atlantic air-liners, at New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York. Slower--slower--and in moments more the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of its towering cylindrical buildings, ablaze with</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlining lights, was coming into view, with midmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them the greatest of all, the huge mass of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">World Government building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As our space-flier dropped slowly toward that mighty .</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure beneath my controlling hands, as it dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the swarms of bright-lit aircraft that were mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to and fro over the great city, so familiar was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene beneath to us four cosmic voyagers that almost did</seg><seg type="columnLine">our great journey, our mighty flight out through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's planets through the countless leagues of space to</seg><seg type="columnLine">great Neptune, and our grotesque and dream-like adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures upon Neptune and its moon, seem to us indeed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than dreams. But as we shot lower we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled from this strange state of mind by one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aircraft beneath, showing the customary red and green</seg><seg type="columnLine">position-lights along its hull, driving up through the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness toward our smoothly falling space-flier. We saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three men in the control-room of the craft gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazedly toward the gleaming, faceted metal ball of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier as they circled us, and then from their craft .had</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst out a score of brilliant vari-colorcd signal-lights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as these blazed out there came a moment later an</seg><seg type="columnLine">answering blaze of lights from each of the swarming</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft below, that shot up now in hundreds toward our</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling flier, crowding crazily about it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down through the darkness we dropped still, those</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarms of aircraft almost jostling us as they seethed</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly in terrific excitement about us. As we shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward over New York's surface we saw that across</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the vast city, and far across the great air-docks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south even, signal-lights were blazing out, a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">panorama of bursting lights stretching out in all direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions! From beneath, too, there came up to us now a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific roar of mingled voices, the vast crowds in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets of the huge city sending their cheering cries up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us in a great thunder-roll of sound as we fell toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. And as I held the space-flier to its smooth drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward amid the swarming aircraft, I saw that Marlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Randall, and even Whitely, were gazing across those</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast, shouting throngs and across the swarms of madly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">darting aircraft that encircled us, with somber, thought-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now we were falling a few hundred feet above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof of the World Government building, on which a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle knot of figures awaited us, and as I gazed from it</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the other roofs of the great city I uttered a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation. "On the roofs--you see ?" I asked. "Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">things of metal--those space-fliers-!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they too were gazing toward the roofs, toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the innumerable crystal-like metal forms that we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-recognize on those roofs in the darkness. But a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse only we had of them lie fore the space-flier was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinking downward to the great roof itself, and as Marlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the knot of figures on that roof he half-turned. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">World-President," he said, quietly, "waiting for us on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That roof's flat expanse was just beneath us, covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself with other great crystal-like gleaming fliers, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a clear space at its center where once had stood our</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flier's framework. There was no framework there</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, but smoothly I brought the flier down upon that</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, down to the roof, poised it a moment a foot above</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and then let it sink to the roof's surface and opened a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-dozen of the switches before me, the throbbing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">356</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the generators that had been enduring for so long ceas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and giving way to an unaccustomed silcnce that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange to our ears. Then Marlin had turned, was open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the inner door, and in another moment the outer one</seg><seg type="columnLine">had swung open also, a flood of cool, clean air rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in upon us. Marlin leading, we stepped out, stood un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily for a moment on the great roof's surface be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the brilliance of the lights that flared above it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From beneath and above came still through the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unceasing roar of the great crowds in the huge city's</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets and the hum of its swarming, seething aircraft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then we saw that the little group of men on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof beside us were coming toward us, the World-Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent at their head. His strong, keen eyes were steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us as he came forward, his hands outstretched, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he had gripped our own hands, was holding them for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment in silence. In that moment we were all four</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying a little as we stood there, gazing about us at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far-flung lights of the great city around us, at the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">before 11s, at the strangely-dulled stars overhead, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though never had we seen them before. When the World-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fresident spoke, his human-sounding voice seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange even to our ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Marlin--Randall--Whitely---Hunt--" he said. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have come back then from your mission?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've come back--from Neptune," Marlin said</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The World Congress is already gathered--is waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you," said the other, as simply, and then with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the officials almut him we were walking toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stair-opening in the great roof, were walking through</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranks of the great looming faceted things of metal that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw now clearly were replicas each of our own poly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hedron-like space-flier!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down through that opening we went, down stairs after</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs until we were emerging through a high door on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raised platform at the end of the great room in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the World Congress awaited us. Brilliant white</seg><seg type="columnLine">light flooded that room and in it, in silent row upon row,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were seated the twelve hundred members of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Congress. As we four entered, with the World-President</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his officials, there was turned instantly toward us</seg><seg type="columnLine">every eye, and a tense hush of utter silence settled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which our own steps seemed loud to our ears. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no shouts or cheering cries from the Congress' members,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that moment, for all knew that what they were to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">now from us was the word of hope or hopelessness for</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, the report of our great mission upon which rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's single chance for life. And as I stared across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, silent Congress in that moment, there flashed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen of my mind, strangely enough, a picture of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">other silent, solemn council before which Marlin and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stood but a few days before, that Council of Thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the strange Neptunians whose great synthesizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe-mechanism had spoken to us. Then, as we stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, the World-President was stepping forward to ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress the Congress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no need for me to tell you who are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four men standing here before you," he said. "Marlin--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitely--Randall--Hunt--these four who went out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune on the earth's behalf, and whom earth has tense-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly awaited now for weeks. I do not know, any more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, what they found there, what chance for earth they</seg><seg type="columnLine">found or failed to find. And it is that that we, the repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentatives of the world's peoples, now wait to hear from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin, the leader of this great expedition." Utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence held all present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND as the World-President stepped hack. Marlin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsteady still from our unaccustomedness to earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitation, and with face drawn, but eyes steady and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright, was stepping forward. Facing the great rank on</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank of members of the World Congress he stood, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">we others slipped into the seats behind him, facing them</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment in tense silence as he summoned his ener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gies to speak. In that moment, as my eyes roved across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great hall, I made out the faces of many there known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, the face, just beneath our platform, was that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my chief at the Intelligence Bureau, Markham, the faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many others, strange and yet familiar, all turned now</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Marlin. And then, in a voice low at first but</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaining in power as he went 011, Marlin was speaking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, his words sounding out through the great room in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hushed, unnatural silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began by reviewing in a few sentences the colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">peril that had threatened and was threatening us, the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased spin of the sun beneath Neptune's mighty ray that</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon must result in its division and the solar system's</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom. Then, with a reference to that other gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the World Congress at which our venture out to Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune had been decided upon, he came to the start of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture. While they listened in utter tenseness he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our start, of our going out from earth first of all men</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the outer void, out past the mysteries of Mars with</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater and greater speed. Our onward flight through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible dangers of the great asteroidal belt and our nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row escapes in it, our outward rush past mighty Jupiter</seg><seg type="columnLine">--these he described in his steady voice, and we felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenseness that held all in the great room in dead silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He told them of what doom had nearly been ours at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saturn, of our fall toward its great rings of death and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our narrow escape from them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, with a little pause, he was going 011, was telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our onward flashing flight beyond Saturn out through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vast outer reaches of the solar system, out past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit of Uranus toward Neptune itself. In utmost sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pense they listened as he told of our arrival at last at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune, of our amazement at finding that giant world</seg><seg type="columnLine">shielded with an enclosing roof of metal, and of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater amazement at finding that world, the colossal city</seg><seg type="columnLine">that covered it, utterly dead and deserted. Low exclama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of surprise broke from his listeners then as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrated how he and I had been surprised in the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">city of Neptune by the coming of the Neptunians in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders, their attack upon and pursuit upward of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitely and Randall in the spacc-flier, their capture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves and their taking us from Neptune out to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon-world of Triton. And a low wave of uncontrollable</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement swept across the great room as Marlin told</seg><seg type="columnLine">those in it of the roofed and warmed world of Triton</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the countless millions of Neptunians on it, and above</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of the giant force-ray that was stabbing from Triton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunward side toward the sun and loosing doom upon us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that excitement intensified when he told of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">else we had found at Triton, of the other giant force-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbing out from its other side toward a distant star of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sagittarius, of our captivity there and our learning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunian tongue, our being brought before the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council of thirty of the Neptunian races. I saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds before us listening with abated breath as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told them that gigantic epic of the solar system's past that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been told us by the great globe-mechanism of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council, that story of the Neptunians' past history and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great doom of increasing cold that had driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from Neptune to Triton and that now had caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">357</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them to seek to split the sun itself to thwart that doom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How they had sent out toward that star in Sagittarius</seg><seg type="columnLine">another great force-ray years before, to brace Triton</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the back-pressure of the sun-ray and to keep it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from being burled out into the great void, how they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally sent out the great force-ray toward the sun also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning the sun ever faster toward the doom of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other planets, planning to wreck the universe to save their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own race. These things he told them through the hushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence that again had replaced their stir and murmur of</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But excitement held them again when he told how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I, desperate at the doom we saw hanging thus over</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, had made our wild attempt to escape from Triton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dared to cross its surface and had stolen a cylinder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing up through the great roof and out from Triton</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that cylinder with their pursuit close behind us, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had been saved from that pursuit by Whitely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall in the space-flier, who, although we had thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">them dead, had managed to elude their own attackcrs by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ruse and had hovered near Triton in hopes of saving</seg><seg type="columnLine">us; how in the space-flier we had fled back from Triton</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Neptune and had smashed our pursuers, while we</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were over Neptune; these things, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep now, he told to the hundreds of his listeners. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, swaying a little from sheer utter weariness of body</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spirit, Marlin told them how we, knowing that never</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone could we halt or even reach that giant ray driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Triton toward the sun, had headed back for earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the utmost speed of which we were capable, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed back like some great messenger-meteor through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solar system to earth to carry to the peoples of earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of what we had found, to gather the forces of earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and head back to Neptune with them for a last gallant</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to halt that mighty ray of doom!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Marlin's voice had ceased, when he had stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsteadily back from the platform's edge, his words</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed reverberating still through the hushed silence that</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevailed among the twelve hundred massed members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the World Congress. Then again the World-Prcs.ident,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own face as set and strange now as those of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">massed members before him, was stepping forward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have heard the report of Dr. Marlin and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">three companions," he said, quietly, "and you, and I, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peoples of earth listening now, know what situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces us, what last necessity, even as was foreseen, has</seg><seg type="columnLine">arisen before us. That giant force-ray of which Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin told you, that colossal ray which these Neptunians arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbing toward the sun's edge from their far moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">world of Triton, is turning the sun ever faster, as all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know, is decreasing its rotatory period by four hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">each passing day. Within hardly more than forty days</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will have decreased the sun's rotatory period to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatal period of one hour, will have increased its spin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that critical fatal speed, at which the sun must inevitably</seg><seg type="columnLine">divide into a double sun, a double star, engulfing our</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, and almost all others, in fiery death in that cosmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">cataclysm. This is known to you and you know, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it is only by halting that giant force-ray from Triton</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we can save our sun, our world, from that tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous cataclysm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This much we have known, indeed, and now with what</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge these four men have brought back from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">unparalleled venture out through the gulf of space to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system's edge, to Neptune itself, you know also</seg><seg type="columnLine">what lies before us. We have, indeed, built during the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">absence of Marlin and his three friends that great fleet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-fliers, which we had decided to build. Using the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans of their original space-flier and applying all our</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts toward achieving a quantity production of space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliers on those plans, we have been able, as you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to construct in their absence no less than five thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-fliers exactly like their own, space-fliers that rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">now upon the roofs of New York's great buildings around</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, complete now with trained crews and ready to start!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The gathering of earth's forces has thus already taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">place!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And upon this great fleet of space-fliers rests now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate of the solar system!

What perils, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposition that fleet will meet. Marlin has made clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you.

There can be but one fit to lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fleet out to such battle, and that is Marlin himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was the first to discover this peril that hangs over</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, who was one of the first to suggest a means of strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling against that peril, and who has led this first daring</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture out through a thousand perils to Neptune, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again to eardi with the knowledge without which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not act.

"Strange," said Randall, "it all seems, almost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as when we first went out past Mars."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strangely similar, indeed, did it seem to all of us, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panorama that now again stretched all about us, visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the racing space-flier's windows, as we sat in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four control-chairs before them. For ahead and away to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left gleamed again the dull-red disk of Mars, farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">now from us than on our first trip out but seeming al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most the same. Ahead too, and close to the right, shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty Jupiter, and beyond it on the left the yellow spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Saturn once more, with tar beyond it and straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead again the green little spark of light that was Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune. Behind, too, the bluish light-spot of earth and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessened fire-disk of the sun were as before, and as be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the blazing stars that jeweled all the deep-black</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmament about us. But behind our flier we could barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">see innumerable tiny gleaming points moving forward at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same speed as ourselves through the void, keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace with us in regular formation, a great V-formation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which our flier was the point and that moved steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">on through space. For those tiny points, extending back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out of sight in the void behind us, were the space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliers of that great fleet of five thousand space-fliers which</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own, the flagship, was leading out through the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system to Neptune!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For two days, now, we had been flashing with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">great fleet behind us from earth, out toward the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system's edge on our mighty expedition, and five days</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed since we had stood before the World Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gress with Marlin rendering to it our report. In those</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervening three days on earth we had been the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such a whirl of hectic activity as the world had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">known before--the whirl of preparations for the start of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colossal fleet. For in those three short days Marlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the energies of a world at his bidding, had strained</seg><seg type="columnLine">every nerve to complete the last preparations of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">armada of space-fliers which he, with us three as his lieu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenants, was to lead out on its unprecedented flight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The most necessary preparation was the equipping of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the five thousand space-fliers with the concentrated force-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray weapons used by the Neptunians in their space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders, those concentrated rays which, instead of push-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing against what they struck, tore through it with driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. Fortunately, the production of these concentrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays required only the addition of special smaller ray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings beside the regular ray-openings in the sides of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space-fliers, but even so it strained the capacities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world's workers to install in each of the space-fliers</seg><seg type="columnLine">those smaller openings in the short time available.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each of the five thousand space-fliers held a crew of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight, their operators having been trained during our ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sence as fast as the fliers themselves had been built. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">four in our own space-flier, the flagship of the great fleet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fotir additional crew-members now, four mechanic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">operators who worked in shifts and tended ceaselessly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation of the flier's various mechanisms, the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators, and the other mechanical equipment, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving Marlin and Randall and Whitely and myself free</seg><seg type="columnLine">to devote all our attention to the command of the great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet itself, though one of us retained the controls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier itself. Another preparation that had been made</seg><seg type="columnLine">during our absence had been to equip each flier with</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-walkers for its crew, and to equip each with effi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient radiophone apparatus. This, while the Heaviside</seg><seg type="columnLine">layer around earth would prevent it functioning from</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth to space or from space to earth, would allow free</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication from space-flier to space-flier while in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space itself, and thus would allow Marlin and us to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol with spoken orders all the great fleet we led.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus the last preparations had been completed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">three days after our arrival at earth the great fleet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-fliers had taken its departure, the five thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">faceted polyhedron-like fliers rising as one from the flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">roofs of New York's countless gigantic buildings. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more we had started at night, and it seemed that all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peoples of earth had assembled in and around New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York that night to speed us farewell. The vast crowds</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had watched our single space-flier start out on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">first trip weeks before, were as nothing to those vaster</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds that had watched the great fleet leave, since all</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth knew no%v what word we had brought back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune and knew that in two score more days, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fleet was successful in its tremendous task, unless it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could win through the Neptunian opposition and halt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant sun-ray, that all on earth would perish in flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus surely there could have been no tenser moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in earth's history than that, when, with the World-Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent and the massed members of the World Congress</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching again around us, our flagship had risen from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof of the great World Government building into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night, flashing up and outward once more toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sagittarius, toward unseen Neptune. And behind us al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most instantly there had flashed up in regular timing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation our five thousand following fliers, racing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after us with colossal speed like ourselves and flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that hollow triangle or V-formation behind us. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation had been adopted so that the rays of the fliers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fleet, driven back toward earth to push them on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not strike against other fliers behind them, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been the case had our fleet moved out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a compact mass. And now for forty-eight hours our</seg><seg type="columnLine">five thousand space-fliers had been hurtling outward, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own flagship still at the apex of their formation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as we four sat now again in the four control-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs, two of our mechanic-operators watching over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators behind us and the other two asleep in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunks, we had a somewhat different array of controls</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us. Before myself were the controls of the flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, unchanged, with the six switches that directed its</seg><seg type="columnLine">propulsion force-rays from the six openings. Marlin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, to my right, had before him now as well as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">array of astronomical instruments, the black mouthpiece</seg><seg type="columnLine">and speaker of the radiophone, as well as a compact array</seg><seg type="columnLine">of switch-studs by which he could speak to and hear from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the various squadron-leaders in the great fleet behind us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For convenience in giving orders, the five thousand fliers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fleet had been divided into fifty squadrons of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred space-fliers each, and it was to the designated</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader of each squadron that Marlin gave his orders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were then transmitted by that leader to the hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred fliers of his squadron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before Randall, too, to my left, were new controls, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls of the concentrated force-rays which were to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">our fleet's weapons even as such rays were the Neptun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ians' also, and with which our flagship had of course been</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">359</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped. Those controls were two thick metal levers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">no great size, with hand-grips at their end, one of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled by its position the side of the flier from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the concentrated cleaving ray was shot forth, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlling the slant or exact direction at which that ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">was emitted. With Randall handling these, our weapons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitely had before him all the space-flier's remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls--those of the generators, air replenishers, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various recording dials that were vital to its operation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other essential things. So that as our throbbing flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove on now at the great fleet's head, with Marlin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall and Whitely and myself gazing to the left toward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearing crimson shield of Mars, we had each before</seg><seg type="columnLine">us some vital part of our great fleet's or our flier's control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gazing toward Mars' red disk, Marlin broke the si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence. "We'll need no side-rays this time to hold us out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it," he said, and T nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, it's far enough from us now, and the speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our fliers will take them safely past--is taking them past</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. But it's the asteroids ahead that I've been think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin somberly shook his head. "There's no help</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it, Hunt," he said. "We'll have to lead the fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight through the asteroidal belt and trust to chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that as few of our fliers as possible will be struck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The following hours, therefore, were perhaps the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense and terrible that ever we had experienced. For as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we shot on past Mars and through the great belt of whirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing asteriods, it was not possible for the five thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-fliers of our fleet to maneuver to avoid those aster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oids. We must hold straight on in our regular forma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, we knew, lest all our fliers crash one into the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so in that formation we went steadily on through that</seg><seg type="columnLine">great zone of death. And hardly had we entered it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and Randall and Whitely gazing forth as in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely as myself, than an expanding dark globe loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly before us, sweeping past us with terrifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">closeness, and then as it shot past there came suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the blackness of space behind us a soundless flash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiery light, that flared for a moment and faded. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">asteroid, we knew, had struck a flier close behind us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  From ahead and from cither side still, as we sped on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">other asteroids were rushing, following their complicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbits as our great fleet's open triangle of space-fliers</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved through them, and now again and again still be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind us came other fiery flashes in quick succession,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashes of flame which each marked the instant destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of a space-flier and all its occupants! Yet there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came no word, no protest, from any of the space-fliers</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us, all were going steadily forward at unaltered</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed and in unaltered formation through the great belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whirling death. And though, within a few hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a score of our space-fliers had been annihi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated in white-hot and soundless flashes of fire as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were struck by the hurtling asteroids, the rest had escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">unscathed, and Marlin was giving to them the cheering</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge that we had won through the asteroidal belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were out of its whirling death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus again Jupiter loomed ahead and to our right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though closer now and greater in apparent size, and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">we four were staring toward it in almost as great a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder as formerly, as its mighty cloud-wrapped disk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and attendant four big moons loomed closer. By this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, Marlin had transmitted to all the fliers behind us</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brief order, and already from each of them and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own a side force-ray was shooting toward the gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet to hold us out from its terrific attraction. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V-formation in which our five thousand space-fliers flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so slightly tilted sidewise as to allow the use of side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays by all our fliers, and a side-ray of immense power</seg><seg type="columnLine">it required indeed to hold each of us out from the mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">monarch of the solar system's planets as we sped past its</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge and enigmatic sphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT still on and on through the void our mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">armada of space-fliers was racing, on toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green spark of Neptune that slowly waxed brighter far</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of us. That little green spot of light held our eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to the exclusion of Saturn's yellow disk, expanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to the left before us as we shot toward it also, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all our minds were centered upon Neptune and what</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty task it was that awaited us at that great world and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its moon, what mighty struggle would be ours. So that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not until Saturn's disk had expanded almost to</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon-size before us, surrounded by the great rings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">by its whirling moons, that we gave that planet any atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. By this time, for more than seven days our huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet had been speeding out through the boundless void,</seg><seg type="columnLine">out through the solar system, and so it was as a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">landmark to us that Saturn appeared as we neared it, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last planet between us and our goal of Neptune. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">our great fleet close behind, as we drew abreast of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge planet's mighty sphere and colossal rings, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently enough that we four, gathered again in the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol-chairs of our flier, and gazed toward it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The most dangerous planet in the solar system--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saturn," said Marlin, as we looked toward the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">world from which our side-rays now were holding us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It was death almost for us before when we ventured</seg><seg type="columnLine">loo close in passing it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we're safe enough from it this time,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitely commented, "for since then it's moved farther to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left--is farther away from us with no danger to us</seg><seg type="columnLine">now of chance meteors from its rings."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, we're safe enough from it now," Marlin admit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted, "yet at the same time "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before Marlin could finish the words they were inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted by a thing that chills my blood to remember even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.

Almost it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed that we must crash straight into the oncoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunian cylinders, the whole firmament for the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment ahead of us being full of their onrushing mass.

Cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders and space-fliers were being annihilated in that mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment by scores by the slender rays that drove across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing gap between the fleets, and then just as we seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">011 the point of crashing dead into their oncoming cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders they had shot their propulsion-rays sidewise, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerved aside and were rushing with our own great fleet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had instantly swerved with them, through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">void!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Side by side for the moment the Neptunian and Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleets flew, countless weapon-rays stabbing across the gap</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them as at dizzying speed they shot through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">void, and I kept our space-flier at our fleet's head, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin gave his orders to the fliers behind us, Whitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly opening and closing the controls of our generators</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep constant the flier's power and speed, Randall was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sending our own slender and deadly rays shooting toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite Neptunian cylinders like bolts of straight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-seen lightning!

"They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are trying to escape from us in Saturn's rings and moons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get back to Neptune to rejoin the main Neptunian</seg><seg type="columnLine">body!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that now as fleet and fleet rushed forward I held</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own flier at our own fleet's head, racing forward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vast whirling system of Saturn's rings and moons</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretching dangerously before us. Full before us was</seg><seg type="columnLine">looming greater each instant the spinning dark globe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and now as our two fleets</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed side by side toward it at terrific speed, stabbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">still at each other from space-flier to cylinder with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated weapon-rays, it seemed that inevitably in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next moment we must crash against the big moon!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seeing this, though, Marlin shouted a swift order into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthpiece before him, and instantly in answer to it our</seg><seg type="columnLine">great fleet's mass bore sidewise against the racing mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Neptunian cylinders! For an instant it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the two fleets were merging into each other, space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier crashing into cylinder and slender rays coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick, and then the smaller Neptunian fleet had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">way beneath the pressure of ours, had veered sidewise</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that in the following moment the two fleets were rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing past Titan's whirling sphere!</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">363</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now. we were inside Titan's orbit, and as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled farther in just across the path of another and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller whirling moon, I saw that Saturn's colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">rings lay edge-on close before our racing masses of craft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic spinning rings of mighty meteor-masses, count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less great meteor-swarms whirling there about the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow planet whose sphere now was stupendous in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens before us. In another few moments Neptunian</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders and space-fliers of Earth would have rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">alike into those thundering swarms of meteors, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">no craft could live for a moment. Already chance meteors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were whirling through space about us as we shot on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder or space-flier here and there in the two racing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grappling fleets vanishing in white-hot flashes of heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fire as a meteor struck them. But other and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders and space-fliers were vanishing in wreckage be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the cleaving rays from either fleet, and both were</seg><seg type="columnLine">racing on so intent upon our terrific struggle as to vtio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tice hardly at all the vast whirling rings before us! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Whitely utter a hoarse cry to Marlin as we flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, heard Marlin swiftly utter an order in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthpiece before him, and then our fleet, and the Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunian cylinders at almost the same instant, had shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">diagonally upward and instead of crashing into the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">rings' edge were slanting swiftly up over them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, as Neptunians and Earth fliers drove to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether up over Saturn's colossal rings, the intensity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the struggle seemed to deepen to a fierceness as yet un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known. For the moment it was sheer blind battle without</seg><seg type="columnLine">need of reason or command, sheer awful combat there in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space above Saturn's whirling rings, with beside us the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast cloud-screened yellow sphere of Saturn itself loom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gigantic, and with outside the great rings its whirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing maze of moons! Cylinders and space-fliers grappled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that moment with mindless fury, and with a swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and skill of which I had not dreamed myself capable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I whirled our space-flier this way and that amid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarming, boiling ruck of the giant battle, amid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grappling hordes of space-fliers and cylinders that filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air before us, their cleaving concentrated rays slicing</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way and that in swift circles of death about us! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Whitely laughing a little from excitement beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as the battle reached this terrific pitch, saw Randall</seg><seg type="columnLine">sending our own weapon rays this way and that with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning-swiftness, Marlin gazing out tensely into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell of battle that filled space about us. Struggling there</seg><seg type="columnLine">above Saturn's colossal rings, ever and again Neptunian</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder or space-flier of Earth shot too low and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught by the whirling meteor swarms of those giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">rings, annihilated instantly by them! Hundreds of cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders and space-fliers had gone to death already, but so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far the battle bad been almost even despite our greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">force, and seeing this Marlin cried quickly into the order-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthpiece before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INSTANTLY our whirling space-fliers shot back sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly from the wild ruck of the battle, formed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly into a long double column of fliers with our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier at the head, and then before the surprised Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">could reform their own spread-out and disorganized mass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our compact column had leaped forward and had crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through their formless mass with a great shock, fliers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cylinders perishing in scores in that reeling crash!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then our double column had divided, pushing out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side and thus splitting and separating the Neptu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nian mass of cylinders, and thus separated and inferior</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us in numl)ers we were in the next moment leaping</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them there above Saturn's rings and sending their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders into wrecked fragments by the hundreds with</seg><seg type="columnLine">our whirling rays! Fiercely their own rays came back</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us, as they faced us, and then they seemed to waver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hesitate. And before we could sense their intention</seg><seg type="columnLine">their remaining cylinders, depleted by scores each mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment now and numbering no more than fifteen hundred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dropped downward almost to the giant whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">rings, had formed into a swift massed formation there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then with all the power of their propulsion-rays were</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeding away, away from Saturn, out through the void</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the calm green distant spot of light that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're fleeing!" I cried, as our own space-flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled around in that moment. "We've beaten these, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least--they're fleeing back to Neptune!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Regular formation--all squadrons!" Marlin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting into the mouthpiece before him. "Full speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from Saturn--after the Neptunians!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as our space-fliers, still over four thousand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">number despite the losses of that wild combat, massed</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly together in their V-formation and then were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtling out from Saturn through the gulf after the flee-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cylinders, I was crying to him over the sudden wax-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing throb of our generators: "There's far more Neptu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nian cylinders than these that waited for us at Saturn</seg><seg type="columnLine">here--the rest must be waiting at Neptune itself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded, grim-faced. "The main Neptune fleet is</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably waiting there for us--and must outnumber us</seg><seg type="columnLine">by almost two to one. But if we can overtake these fif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen hundred cylinders before us we'll keep them, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, from rejoining their main fleet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Saturn and its rings and moons was dwindling</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly behind us as our great fleet shot forward again</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it, out toward Neptune's steady, pale green little</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-spot, and after the hundreds of cylinders fleeing be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore us toward it. With an acceleration that never before</seg><seg type="columnLine">had we dared to risk did we leap forward through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">void now, and so awful was the pressure of that accelera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion upon us that even with our shock-absorbing appa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratus we were crushed almost into unconsciousness by it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steadily, though, with the last of my consciousness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, I held the space-llier's speed and course on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, while close behind us there shot after us with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same terrific acceleration, the fliers of our own fleet. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, though, that the Neptunians were fleeing toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">their great world at a speed and acceleration as great</seg><seg type="columnLine">as ours, for we were not gaining upon them. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">massed hundreds of cylinders, indeed, were not visible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us in the great void ahead except by means of our tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope, but with it we could keep them in view and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">check their progress and ours out through the great gulf</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the solar system's edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out--out--for hour upon hour we throbbed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the void after those fleeing Neptunian cylinders, out once</seg><seg type="columnLine">again toward great Neptune and toward the last mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle that was to be ours there. For well we knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two thousand and more Neptunian cylinders that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had waited for us there at Saturn, that had laid that great</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambush in space for us there and then had battled us so</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercely over Saturn, were but a portion of the Neptunian</seg><seg type="columnLine">main fleet of cylinders, sent out to delay, and ii possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to destroy us. That great main body of their cylinders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew, must number almost double as many craft as</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own, and undoubtedly was aware of our coming and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was waiting for us at Neptune or near it. And it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great main body of the Neptunian cylinders that we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">364</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome, I knew, before ever we could hope to get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton and halt there the giant force-ray that was turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the sun on toward the doom of the solar system. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">well we knew, too, that in the interval the Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had time to build many more cylinders, to make their</seg><seg type="columnLine">great fleet even greater, and that whatever mighty wea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pons they had devised in that time we now must face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that as our great fleet of space-fliers, holding to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular formation, flashed on an'j on and on through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great gulf of space, on out through the outer vast reaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the solar system toward its outermost planet, our every</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort was bent upon overtaking the fleeing Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us and annihilating them before they could rejoin</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main body. At the same colossal speed as ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were fleeing from before us, on toward Neptune's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny green disk far ahead, and though we held steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our pursuit after them, we could not lessen the gap be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween us. Hour passed into hour and day into change-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less day thus as we throbbed 011 in that tremendous pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit, hours and days that we could not measure, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">things seeming timeless now as our great fleet flashed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this terrific pursuit. At maximum speed, at millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of miles an hour, the Neptunians and ourselves were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtling on, yet they kept out of reach ahead of us, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune grew larger ahead. And now that mighty pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit of ours had become so strange and unreal and dream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that it was as men in a dream that we watched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept and watched in our space-fliers as earth's brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet shot on through the last readies of the solar system</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward its edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Timeless indeed seemed the day on day, the hour on</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, of that daring pursuit of our fleeing enemies Out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Saturn toward great Neptune, but now we knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that that pursuit had begun to draw to an end, since Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune's disk was steadily enlarging before us and we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun slowly to draw closer to the fleeing cylinders!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Closer and closer our fleet, our own foremost space-flier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coming to those fleeing fifteen hundred cylinders, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interval of hours and days of pursuit out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild combat at Saturn seemed as though it had not ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isted, so tense once more we bccame as we drew nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Neptunians before us. At last, with Neptune's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale green disk and the bright little spot of Triton above</seg><seg type="columnLine">and behind it within hours of us, we had come so close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fleeing cylinders that their mass, hurtling 011 in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cone-like formation, was clearly visible to our unaided</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes in the void ahead. And by this time, in every space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier of our onrushing fleet, its occupants were waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatiently for the moment when we would be near</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to loose our concentrated weapon-rays on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleeing craft ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll overtake them before they reach Neptune!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin declared, gazing intently ahead toward the gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing points that were the fleeing cylinders far ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Within hours now we'll be up to them 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well enough for us that we can do so, too!" Whitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">commented. "For if they rejoined their main body, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">odds against us might be overpowering!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now as pursuers and pursued rushed nearer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer toward mighty Neptune's great pale-green sphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were also nearing each other, our onleaping four</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand space-fliers drawing closer and closer toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">those fleeing fifteen hundred cylinders, though they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great distance from us. Beside me Randall's hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were resting on the weapon-ray controls, and as we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer still to the fleeing Neptunians, I saw Marlin lean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward the mouthpiece, preparing to give his order</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to the great fleet behind us. Closer--closer--we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly make out now the massed fleeing cylinders far in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the void ahead--already almost within accurate ray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">range, a swarm of black dots against Neptune's cloudy</seg><seg type="columnLine">grcen disk ahead. And as we came thus close Marlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned to voice his order, to spread the space-fliers of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet into a broad firing-formation and send their rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbing ahead. But that order was never uttered, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that moment Whitely uttered a sharp cry, and we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the racing mass of cylinders ahead was suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowing!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With unprecedented quickness its speed was decreas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing before us and in moments more we would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed into those slowing cylinders had not Marlin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice snapped a quick order that slowed instantly all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliers oi our fleet likewise. Fearful of some trick, slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thus, we gazed intently ahead in that moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then all of us had cried out together as we saw, beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">that swarm of black dots that were the slowing fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred Neptunian cylinders before us, other black dots</seg><seg type="columnLine">that showed against great Neptune's disk also, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed great now in the heavens ahead! Other black</seg><seg type="columnLine">dots, an immense swarm of them, that we knew were</seg><seg type="columnLine">other cylinders, an immense fleet of them, rushing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Neptune toward the fifteen hundred before us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward ourselves! And then as in moments more the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen hundred cylinders before us slowed and stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in space even as we had slowed, we saw sweeping from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them, from great Neptune, those other cylinders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming with them, there in space, a colossal semi-circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of fully eight thousand Neptunian cylinders in all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that faced our own four thousand or more space-fliers</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in the void! It was the giant assembled Neptun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian fleet, gathered here outside their world to face our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own fleet, in that great struggle in which Earth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune were to come now at last to death-grips for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">life or death of the solar system!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You of Neptune or We of Earth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OLUMN formation--all squadrons full speed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was Marlin's voice that shouted that swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">order in the next instant, and then, even as the gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">semi-circle of the Neptunian fleet was leaping through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the void toward us, our four thousand and odd space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliers, outnumbered almost by two to one by the cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">massed ahead, had shifted like lightning from their great</seg><seg type="columnLine">V-formation to one of a long double column once more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no sooner had its squadrons taken that new forma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion than the column slanted slightly to allow the free</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of their propulsion-rays. They were flashing for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward now like an enormous spear cast toward the curv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing front of the giant Neptunian fleet! For it was Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin's intention to meet that outnumbering mass of cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders by splitting it with a column as we had done over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saturn to our enemies, and then engaging separately the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of the disorganized mass. So that now-, even as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great half-circle of the Neptunian cylinders whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the void to overwhelm us, we had formed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, double column and were dashing straight at them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Holding the controls of our space-flier steady in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, I was aware for an instant of a sense of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter strangeness of all the wild scene about me--of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flier's interior with Marlin and Randall and Whitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">365</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched in their chairs beside ine, of the great column</seg><seg type="columnLine">of polyhedron-like, gleaming, faceted, space-fliers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came forward through the black gulf of star-sown space</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us, of the oncoming giant line of the Neptunian</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders flashing toward us in turn, and of the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense green disk of mighty Neptune looming in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black vault behind them. All seemed for the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the panorama of some strange nightmare stretched about</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, but that momentary sensation that had gripped me so</seg><seg type="columnLine">often in our wild rush through the solar system vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the next instant as stern reality loomed before us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were the mighty curving line of gleaming Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunian cylinders through which in the next split-second</seg><seg type="columnLine">our great column must crash! I braced myself mentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that vast crash that must almost inevitably mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">death for the foremost of our space-fliers; I was aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we drove upon the onrushing Neptunian line, that now</seg><seg type="columnLine">unthinkable storms of deadly concentrated rays were rag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from fleet to fleet; and then suddenly, at the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant that we thought to crash into their great ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching line, that line opened swiftly before us to al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low our great column to rush unharmed through it 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So astounded were we by that unlooked-for maneuver</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the part of the Neptunians, that before we could check</seg><seg type="columnLine">our speed, we were through, had shot in our entire col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umn through that opening in their semi-circle, which in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly closed again behind us. And as it did so, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed toward each other the open ends of their semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle, thus closing that circle even as we rushed into it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our fleet was held enclosed within the circle of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own! And then, from all those thousands of Neptunian</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders that surrounded us, there were stabbing at us in</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless number slender shafts of concentrated force,</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless pencil-like weapon-rays that instantly clove</seg><seg type="columnLine">through hundreds of our gathered space-fliers and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">strewed space thick about us with their wreckage, even as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we sought in vain to answer that terrible rain of deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trapped!" Whitely was shouting. "They've trapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">us inside their circle--are destroying us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For, though our own rays were fiercely springing forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and striking cylinder after cylinder of the vast fleet that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gathered about us, that fleet so outnumbered us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had such advantage of position, that it was decimating</seg><seg type="columnLine">us in short order. Our space-fliers had broken from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">column-formation now, and in a loose, disorganized mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">were drifting at the center of that great ring of death</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Neptunians had formed about us. Swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">our fliers were going into wreckage and death beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrific storm of rays from all around us, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin's voice was flaring as he shouted an order into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouthpiece.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All space-fliers mass together," he cried, "and turn all</seg><seg type="columnLine">your propulsion-rays outward!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're going to--" Whitely began, but Marlin cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">him short.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're going to break up the Neptunians' circle in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only way it can be broken up!" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As his order sounded the thousands of our space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliers were obeying it, were massing compactly together</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the center of the Neptunians' mighty circle. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">massed, they presented for the moment a perfect target</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our enemies' rays, and for a moment those rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbed thick toward us from all sides. In the next mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment our massed space-fliers were shooting their great</seg><seg type="columnLine">propulsion-rays outward, outward in all directions around</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, outward toward the Neptunians' encircling ring! As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">those rays shot out, they pressed with terrific power</seg><seg type="columnLine">against that ring of cylinders about us, and since our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliers were massed together and thus braced against each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, it was not they that moved but the cylinders, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ring instantly broken up, disintegrated, as those</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders were hurled out into the void from us by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing power of our great propulsion-rays! For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment they were broken up completely, their formation</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely shattered, and before they could reform, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come another order from Marlin and in a compact</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation ourselves, our space-fliers were leaping upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">their shattered masses!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To right and left, like light, drove the deadly weapon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays of our massed space-fliers as we seized the oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity and leaped upon the Neptunians. Ample was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">revenge we had upon them in that moment, since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated rays tore through and wrecked hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their own cylinders as we sprang upon them! Fleeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from before us for the moment, flashing away toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant Neptune's tremendous green disk ahead, they strove</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reform while we leaped after them and harried them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with every weapon-ray which our space-fliers could emit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swiftly, though, even as they rushed onward before us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Neptunian cylinders were drawing together into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great mass again, into a great column-like formation, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as our own column-mass drove beside and after them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon-rays stabbing, their resistance abruptly stiffened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were racing in close formation once more be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side our own mighty fleet, grappling once more with it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in space as both rushed toward great Neptune, But we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had struck a mighty blow at their disorganized masses in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment of our opportunity. Fully two thousand of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their cylinders had been swept to death by our rays before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they bad been able to mass again, and now but six</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand or less cylinders remained, racing ahead with</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own four thousand or less fliers!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great green sphere of Neptune was looming colos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sal ahead and slightly beneath our two oncoming fleets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with l&gt;ehind and above it the bright little disk of Triton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was toward Triton even in that wild moment that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us were gazing, toward the source of the giant sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray that we must, somehow, halt. But now the battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">around us had become so furious that we could spare no</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought to aught else, since the two mighty fleets, stab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing ceaselessly at each other with their slender rays as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they slowed their flashing progress forward, were rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the outer reaches of the atmosphere of huge Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune ! Tts air was roaring about our whirling space-fliers</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we shot through it, but as we shot on we saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunian cylinders were going into annihilation swifter</seg><seg type="columnLine">far than were our fliers! For they had formed and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">racing beside us in their half-circle formation, while our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own fliers at Marlin's command had leaped forward in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long column that could concentrate all its fire of rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the side of the Neptunian formation nearest us! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">though slender rays tore lightning-like through fliers here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there across our own column, we saw that their cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders beneath our fire were 1 x:ing wrecked in scores, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds! In that vast running fight we were fast even-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the odds against us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin's eyes were gleaming with excitement as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the Neptunians thus falling beside us under our con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated fire of rays, and Randall and Whitely and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were almost beside ourselves with exultation. Faster were</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling the Neptunian cylinders beneath our rain of rays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rays of their farther cylinders being held from us by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own cylinders in their fatal formation. Already, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">366</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we thundered through the mists of mighty Neptune and</seg><seg type="columnLine">low over its gleaming surface, we saw that the Neptun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian cylinders had been reduced by that deadly fire of ours</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hardly more than three thousand, to hardly more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own fleet of fliers, which had itself lost its hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that vast running battle. As our rays tore into and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through {heir shaken mass hundreds upon hudreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their cylinders had been cloven through, had been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced to whirling wreckage, and we had evened the odds</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our raging battle at last!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as we cried out in triumph, the Neptunians must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen that to continue in that running fight longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was suicidal for them.

Their enormous mass of cylinders, battered out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its half-circle formation by our terrific fire of rays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly swerved in toward our own fleet as the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">great armadas rushed forward above Neptune, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Neptunian fleet of cylinders had crashed obliquely</seg><seg type="columnLine">with immense power into our own space-flier fleet! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next instant it had so merged with it that the two fleets</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased instantly to exist as such and for the moment be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came one colossal, swaying, reeling mass of cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">and space-fliers in utter merged confusion, striking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soaring and smashing each other!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As that great cylinder-armada crashed thus into our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own it had seemed to me that the air all around us was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled in that instant with colliding space-fliers and cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, and with a hell of slender pale and deadly concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated rays that raged thick in whirling death about us!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw before us two onrushing cylinders, whirled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier up to avoid that imminent collision, and then as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed beneath us, saw Randall send our rays driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and cleaving through them, saw them whirl in</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreckage into which a battling cylinder and faceted space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier had crashed themselves in the next instant! I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitely's shout of alarm in the next split-second, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctively flung the flier sidewise through the boiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruck of the battle, just in time to escape a pair of stab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing rays from a cylinder beneath, and then saw those</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays stab on up and strike another cylinder and destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">it! And even as I whirled the flier sidewise, Randall</seg><seg type="columnLine">was driving our rays to right and left against other cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders rushing upon us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE air about us seemed filled in that moment with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single wildly-swirling mass of cylinders and space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliers, grappling with each other there in countless indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidual combats inextricably intermixed, their weapon-rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">going out in destruction through the craft that whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them, their propulsion-rays driving the ships about</seg><seg type="columnLine">them crazily to right and left! With inconceivable fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders and fliers soared and fought and fell above</seg><seg type="columnLine">great Neptune's roof, the air filled with falling wreck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, our great battle reaching now an undreamed-of</seg><seg type="columnLine">phase of intensity, as gleaming cylinders and faceted ball-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like space-fliers were annihilated alike by hundreds! That</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant merged combat of the two fleets had in minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken toll of half the force of each, and I wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly even as I whirled the flier up and back through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wild, annihilating battle how either men of earth or</seg><seg type="columnLine">disk-bodied Neptunians could cling to a Iwttie of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">suicidal nature! Then suddenly from Marlin had come a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse exclamation, and I saw in that instant all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunian cylinders intermixed with our space-fliers ris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upward, as though in answer to a single command!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up!" cried Marlin. "The Neptunians are over us!</seg><seg type="columnLine">They're going to-!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rut before he could finish the sentence, before our</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-fliers could whirl upward in answer to his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand, from the Neptunian cylinders massed above us</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shot down upon us innumerable powerful propul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion-rays, rays that struck scores, hundreds, of our space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliers and drove them down with terrific force to crash</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the metal roof of Neptune beneath us! They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were repeating the maneuver by which we four had</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped from our pursuers over Neptune weeks before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were driving our fliers down to crashing death in hordes!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly as Marlin shouted into the order-mouthpiece,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our fliers leaped forward, to escape from that death that</seg><seg type="columnLine">smote us from above, but as we drove forward in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">column formations again, they went on above us, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their powerful propulsion-rays driving us down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death in scores even as with those rays they prevented</seg><seg type="columnLine">us from rising to meet them! We were being quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed now, and as we saw it, as our column flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on with the Neptunian cylinders massing in another col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umn above and driving our fliers down by scores, we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that not much longer could that unequal battle con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue! Then abruptly Marlin pointed ahead and down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to Neptune's mighty roof beneath us, was crying an</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to us and the fliers behind and about us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That opening!" he cried. "Down through it--down</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the roof! It's our one chance to escape them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	caught my breath at that cry of his, for I saw that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pointing down toward one of the great circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings in Neptune's roof, openings that were set in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there, all being open now as when we had first</seg><seg type="columnLine">explored Neptune's mysteries. To flash down beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof through that opening was our one chance of escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the relentless smiting death above. I saw it, too, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next instant our own flier and all the long column</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us were diving downward at a dizzying angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward that great circular opening; and in the next mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment before the Neptunian cylinders alwve could fathom</seg><seg type="columnLine">our purpose, we had passed through that opening and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were racing forward beneath the great roof! In an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant, though, the Neptunian cylinders had followed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their long column and were racing after us, through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim Neptunian day above the dead and lifeless surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great compartment-city that covered all of Neptune!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On we flashed, with the Neptunian column some dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance behind, numliering now some half-thousand more</seg><seg type="columnLine">in cylinders than our own bare thousand space-fliers. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">until above us we saw another similar opening in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great roof, and then at Marlin's quick order our narrow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">long column of fliers were slanting up toward it, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. And then, outside of the great roof once more, Marlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a swift order that revealed to me the purpose of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strategy. For at that order our fleet checked its upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush and bent its long column lightning-like around to</seg><seg type="columnLine">form a great circle, a circle hovering there around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the great circular opening in the roof through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had just emerged. And in the next moment, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunian column flashed up through that opening like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise in hot pursuit of us, never suspecting us of waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for it, from all the fliers of our great circle there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had radiated toward them storm on storm of deadly con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated rays, rays that smote them with blinding shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">as their column rushed upward and that crashed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of their upflashing cylinders even as they burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">up through the opening, before ever they could catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of us around them! In those seconds of dazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">367</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise there was no chance for them to recoil, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">column of cylinders, as if too astounded for the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">to answer with a single ray, was flashing up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening through a hurricane of rays that in that moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">was annihilating their cylinders by hundreds! But a scant</seg><seg type="columnLine">three or four hundred cylinders of those that ran upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">through that gauntlet of death escaped it, and these</seg><seg type="columnLine">swirled for a moment in stunned confusion above us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then were without formation racing away from us</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Neptune's surface, racing away toward the gleaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">disk of Triton!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beaten!" I cried, as our own space-fliers whirled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">now after the fleeing cylinders. "They're beaten--they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleeing back to Triton!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The giant ray!" Whitely was shouting, as we thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered forward. "We've still more than a thousand fliers</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, and if we can get now to that great sun-ray -- 1"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hold steady after them!" Marlin cried. "We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought our way this far, and we've got now to get to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray and halt it 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now out over Neptune's surface, out through its mists</seg><seg type="columnLine">and outer atmosphere again, the cylinders ahead were</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring at utmost speed, almost leaping in a confused</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disorganized mass, the remnants of that mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet that had come out to meet us outside Neptune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward their rrioon-world of Triton, whose disk gleamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright ahead. A thrill of pride even in our wild excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment shot through me as we thundered on in pursuit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those fleeing cylinders. For whatever else that day might</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold for us, whether or not we were able to halt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant ray on Triton's sunward side that was reaching out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sun and turning it ever faster, we men of earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">had at least proved our fighting ability to the solar system</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all time, had come out to the solar system's edge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shattered there the mighty armada of the Neptunians'</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient and mighty race! And now as we flashed on in</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift pursuit of the fleeing survivors of that armada</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Triton, confidence and hope were strengthening</seg><seg type="columnLine">in us each moment, for with the Neptunians' great fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered what could hold us back from the shattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">and halting of the giant sun-ray and its mechanism ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On--on--and now we were rushing after the fleeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders out of Neptune's atmosphere and into the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less void again, with Triton growing each moment more</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright and big as giant Neptune fell behind us. Across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gulf from Neptune to its moon we sped, after those</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders, with utmost acceleration and speed, and swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">we drew closer to the Neptunians flying before us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly too drew closer to the gleaming sphere of Triton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as it grew larger before us, as we pursued the cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders in toward it, we all cried out as we followed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">our eyes at the sunward side of it the giant pale beam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly visible, of the colossal force-ray acting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, that mighty ray that was turning the sun ever faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the doom of the solar system! We could make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gigantic beam, leaping out into space toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant firc-disk of the sun, and could make out also in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moment a great number of great humped dark shapes</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered on Triton's roof around the great pit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun-ray. As our eyes shifted to Triton's other edge we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could discern the other giant force-ray, which reached out</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the distant star in Sagittarius and by bracing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton with its pressure kept the moon-world from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hurled out into space by the sun-ray's pressure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Around this other ray's pit, too. were a few of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange great humped or domed dark shapes, but in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment we gave them small attention, for the cylinders</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that had l&gt;een fleeing from before us straight toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great sun-ray's giant beam, had abruptly slowed, stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they rushed into Triton's atmosphere, and had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately to face us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was a wild, fierce attempt on their part to hold us</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to the last from their great ray, and as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">three or four hundred cylinders massed so suddenly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore us and faced us, our own column was leaping upori</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with all the impetus of our thousand and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-fliers!

But it was but one of twenty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the next instant our space-fliers, unable longer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">withstand that terrific fire of rays from the gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">domed forts around the pit, were staggering upward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">none other of our fliers having progressed as far down</seg><seg type="columnLine">as ours, and none other of the twenty control-boxes be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing destroyed! And as our space-fliers reeled thus up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, unable to reach the control-boxes in the pit against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the awful fire of the gathered domed forts about it, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that more than a hundred of our fliers had fallen be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the terrific fire of rays from the forts in our mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush downward!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those twenty control-boxes!"

And with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperation born of that thought we shot down once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, down with the bell of rays from the great domed</seg><seg type="columnLine">forts again raging up around us and taking toll of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliers as we shot over them, curving back upward once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, and stabbing again toward the control-boxes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pit's wall our weapon-rays as we reached that curve's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lowest point! But this time, though the great forts took</seg><seg type="columnLine">toll again of scores of our fliers as we shot down over</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and up again, over the pit and up again, our rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so imperfectly aimed, that no control-box was</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed this time!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upward we swirled and then again, with a persistence</seg><seg type="columnLine">more insensate than human, were racing downward again</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a terrific swoop over the pit of the great ray! Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deadly rays of the surrounding hundred domed forts</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed through our down-swooping fliers, sending</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of them again into whirling wreckage, while as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">swooped down over the pit and upward again in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning-like rush through death we saw that our rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">had missed once more and that none of the control-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes bad this time been destroyed by them! And as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeled upward again over the great pit, from over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant domed forts, we saw that but a few more than five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred space-fliers remained to us of the thousand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more with which we had first flashed downward! In</seg><seg type="columnLine">three downward swoops only, in three lightning-like mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of attack, the giant invulnerable forts beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">had annihilated more than-half our force, and we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in destroying but a single one of the twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">control-boxes!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "1 he end!" cried W'hitely.

A great many novels using the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject of Atlantis as a basis have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">published, but "Mukara" stands out. Tt is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a first class fantastic adventure story and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranks as high, it seems to me, as Herbert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carew's, "Vampires of the Andes," a hook</seg><seg type="columnLine">which unfortunately appeared only in En-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gland.

His companion is killed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostile Indians, but he returns to England</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the old record and a necklace com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed of large diamonds set in orichalcum,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the fabled metal of Atlantis. Expeditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc expensive. It is not feasible to sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diamond. Finally Van Camp, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">American newspaperman, agrees to finance</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new expedition in exchange for exclu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive first rights on the story. The expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, composed of Kirby, father, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">son Richard, Woodcock, a doctor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemist, and Antony Freyne, a linguist, set</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for the interior of Brazil, under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guidance of Kirby, senior, who reveals to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them that he has met one of the lost people</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his previous trip and that he lias been</seg><seg type="columnLine">requested to return and bring three more</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions. After many adventures, fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with cannibal pygmies, transversing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley infested with poisonous black and</seg><seg type="columnLine">white snakes, they just manage to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foothills of a magnificent chain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains.

Richard has to undergo</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain tests and rites and having told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nubti that he is already married and that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rather help him than Kado, is given</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain instructions and a talisman which</seg><seg type="columnLine">proves effective.

Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps some one will say: "Are we not civilized?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, we ate not civilized people as yet. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made advancement, yes. But we are just on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer edge of the jungle. Three hundred years</seg><seg type="columnLine">from today; perhaps, one hundred; folk of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">timo will look hack at us, and say, ''Mv, my,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what barbarians." There are two things that</seg><seg type="columnLine">science will have tu combat. First, superstition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that old "hydra-headed monster," that has kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">people in ignorance, and held science back a thous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and years. Just for instance, come with me</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentally to those countries that are considered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most superstitious. What do we find? Lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">education--seventy or eighty per cent illiterate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Have our inventions come from those countries?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did the telephone, the telegraph, the t/team engine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wireless, radio, airships, moving pictures, talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines, electric lights, television, come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">there? They did not. To my mind, a civilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">people are a happy people. I du not mean a</seg><seg type="columnLine">"cat on the rug" contentment. I mean that some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day there will be hustling cities from one end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our country to the other, where every worker</seg><seg type="columnLine">will compete with every other worker for</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficiency. The machines will do it. The ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines will make beautiful, wonderful highways.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The machine will bring the country close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">towns, thereby doing away with the lonesomeness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. In fact, the day is not far distant when</seg><seg type="columnLine">men will have cities a thousand miles long. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines will bring about a great unemployment</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem. That will bring discontent and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness which will be a menace to life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">property. The intelligent classes will then form a</seg><seg type="columnLine">system of industry that will put everybody to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. Such a system will gradually du away</seg><seg type="columnLine">With swollen fortunes and will put an end to</seg><seg type="columnLine">[â€¢overly. Slowly, perhaps, but surely, will come</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day when there will he no rich, and no poor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presto 1 Science will lake leaps and hounds such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the world has never seen before. Then inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary communication will become a fact.</seg><seg type="columnLine">People will have time, money and intelligence, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">devote to things scientific, which will he for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness and comfort; and which will satisfy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human craving for more knowledge, and greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">achievement. Wouldn't this he a glorious planet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live on then? Machinery will bring all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things to pass. And yet old superstition says "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bouse, Johnny, don't look at that ox cart, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Lord had intended us to fly, he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">given us wings."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greed is next. Some of our rich men can</seg><seg type="columnLine">endow observatories with telescopes that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring the moon within a few miles of us. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make the first projectile that goes to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon. With their millions, they could make it pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible for the astronomer, watching with the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope, to see the projectile as it struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon's surface. But science will go on; ruthlessly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">relentlessly--regardless of its handicap, and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, somewhere in the future, earth's inhabitants</seg><seg type="columnLine">will wake up and find themselves in the midst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a millenium of peace and contentment, and always</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an intense desire for further advancement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A word about scientific ficition in Amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stories Monthly and Quarterly, I'll say Amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">is right.

Some cheaper</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazines do that to insure the sale of their fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing issue, but Amazing Stories should not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort to such tactics. It is so wonderful and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting, the sale of it is insured regardless. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have never before patronized a magazine that</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised Stories and only gives half Df them.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">buy them in preference to the others that only</seg><seg type="columnLine">give you suspense and nervous prostration for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your quarter.

Now at the time that the magnitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">meter revolved harmoniously to the tunc of nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">12,001) diameters, the Doctor opened a valve and</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed free fresh air to enter the room! Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely this is rather a weak method of ventilating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space. In thc-first place the sphere is then in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vial of hydrogen--so where is the pure air</seg><seg type="columnLine">(oxygen and nitrogen) coming from? Secondly--</seg><seg type="columnLine">their size is so small that they are able to see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">near-by atom. How is it that large chunks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrogen--or even to give the author his point--</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure air did not come barging in through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valve? Again, wc are to assume that each atom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hydrogen represents a solar system, so at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular juncture the sphere was out in inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary space. Surely even in a microscopic</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system there is the same void--or relative</seg><seg type="columnLine">void as in outer ipacel I atn afraid that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">above is very badly put, but perhaps you sec my</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Now when the electron had increased to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of a golf ball, the machine was accelerated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch up on the electron. Now the electron was</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolving once every 10 seconds--why chase ic ?--</seg><seg type="columnLine">why not cut into its orbit and wait for it to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">round--surely quicker in the long run? Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">here comes the big bump--the pcnctrator is travel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing quicker than light 11 The Doctor and Perkins</seg><seg type="columnLine">are rather bucked at proving Einstein's theories</seg><seg type="columnLine">correct, but yet they fall down on this one point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sure our author has overstepped this time!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, sir, I have tried to make my points as</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear as possible, maybe your authors or corre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spondents may be able to throw light on some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the above. Anyhow it seems to me that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories of micro-cosmic states are rather making</seg><seg type="columnLine">fools of your readers. They provide good read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, I admit, but there is one point that I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite get over. When at school I was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">given to understand that the definition of an atom</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the smallest possible particle oi matter, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot be broken up into any smaller particles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the some matter. What I mean is that a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">alom of--say iron--could not be broken up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten (may I coin a v.ord?) deci-atonis of iron. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have always understood that if one were to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">up an atom, all one would get would be charges</seg><seg type="columnLine">or quantities of electricity and an alom of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">element of lower atomic weight. In this connection</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can turn to radium which discharges electvicity</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rays of energy of some type or other and slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduces to lead. Now surely if people (as an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample) can live o:i an electron of an atom they</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves must be composed or built up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller atoms--which seems to me to be decidedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">paradoxical. Take the definition of a point in</seg><seg type="columnLine">geometry--a point is that which has no magnitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">-- merely location or place. One might as well be</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked to bisect a point. Surely in this connection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of micro-cosmic worlds fresh words are necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the various authors are basing their whole plots</seg><seg type="columnLine">and arguments on absurdities. The whole thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">is rather like the old verse. "Big fleas have little</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleas upon their backs to bite 'em--and so ad</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinitum."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Now after all that, I think a few words of</seg><seg type="columnLine">praise would not go amiss--I met A. S. jusl a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year ago, and personally my choice goes to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following- "Barton's Island"--a good piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginative fiction; "The Chamber of Life," very</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting and enthralling besides being rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">well written; the "World at Bay" and "Armaged-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don--2419, A.D." The story "The Flying Fool"</seg><seg type="columnLine">although obviously absurd is all the same a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort nf story and rather depicts the ordinary man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his scientific learnings. Personally I consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">your generally worst issue is June, 1929--half of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reading matter is Jules Verne's relatively un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting "English at the North Pole." "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beetle Kvpcrimcnt" is the best, but rather poor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Radio Tdcscope" is pointless, and the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">small fry, well not up to much. Mind you, subse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent issues have made up for this rather disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing issue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In the July, 1929 issue the "Super-Perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bride" is rather a good yarn with an unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">ending a love story admitted and one without</seg><seg type="columnLine">much seiencc, but nevertheless worthy of a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the magazine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Please, Mr. Editor, cut down the number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">serials--serials are O.
